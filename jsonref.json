Beth Richardson, a 27-year-old student midwife and coordinator at the seed bank, meets me by a big compost heap that steams on contact with the icy cold air. The heap, a valuable group resource, belongs to the allotment where Beth grows her crops.In allotment greenhouses and back-garden potting sheds across towns, cities and villages in the UK, communities of local growers are digging deep and planting the seeds for a richer, more erse and more resilient food system. It is a trend being repeated all over the world.“Seeds are so powerful, so vital to life, but the range and variety of seeds that the big companies provide are very narrow,” says Josie Cowgill, one of the Stroud seed bank’s 30-strong growers and seed-savers. “In our small way, we are trying to, in each of our gardens or on the land that we grow food on, increase the bioersity within our plots and within Stroud.”The Stroud Community Seed Bank in Gloucestershire is one of hundreds of initiatives across the UK focusing its seed-saving efforts on “open pollinated seed”, which – providing there is no cross pollination – will reliably produce viable, true-to-type plants year after year. Rather than being locked into a cycle of buying new seed every season, seed can be saved and stored for future use. “What we have to do to combat the very narrow genetic basis to our seed is get as many people as possible growing as wide a ersity of seeds as possible,” says Kate McEvoy of Real Seeds, a small-scale producer specialising in open pollinated seed for organic growing.Sally Oates’s garden can be heard before it is seen. Situated among acre upon acre of bare, intensively farmed fields her comparatively small plot of land appears to be a lone island of sweet, thundering birdsong. Oates says her garden, enclosed by luscious green hedges, provides its own compost and its own seeds. “What I would encourage is other gardeners to get together locally and form what is called a seed circle so within the group they can grow their favourite old varieties. When they have surplus seeds they can just exchange them. Even a few gardeners getting together, you can have quite a variety of seeds between you.”Simon Allen, another of Stroud’s seed s, adds: “It doesn’t need a knowledge of genetics, it just needs observation and care.” Richardson explains that “after a number of years, the seed is more adapted to the soils, climate and conditions that it’s been grown in, if the strongest specimens are selected. It’s essentially a better crop grown in Stroud because over the years it has evolved to the conditions here. It becomes a landrace.”Seed  Annie Page, whose polytunnels teem with bright red tomatoes, describes her garden as her sanctuary. It’s not difficult to see why. Rows of cabbages and Thrupp parsnips stand proud in the morning sun that streams into the steep valley.“One of the landrace varieties we all grow is called the Thrupp parsnip. Thrupp is a village just outside Stroud, and the lady who saves the seed has been doing it for years. It grows really well in our area. It has adapted so it’s going to be slightly different to parsnip seeds anywhere else in the world. We are developing the seeds by saving them.”Although there are many safeguards around the world for the preservation of seeds, such as the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and the Millennium Seed Bank at Kew, the continual evolution and specialisation of these saved seeds is of significant value to the robustness, resilience and ersity of seed globally. Sinead Fortune, programme manager of the Seed Sovereignty Programme, says: “By being grown out and maintained by seed s, they’re still living and developing. They’re still a real living entity, as opposed to a static seed in a bank somewhere.” McEvoy adds: “The more you have these things being grown on a local scale and by many people, the more resilient it is. You haven’t got just one point of failure. You’ve got multiple backups.”One of the few upsides of the lockdowns over the past year has been a huge boost in demand for seed. The seed s hope this could be the green shoots of a “grow your own” revolution that re-ersifies seed crops. McEvoy says that in the spring not only the Stroud seed bank but “all the home garden seed companies were basically having to just shut down their websites. They had more orders than they could actually get out the door.”Fortune, who works with many national suppliers, wondered if seed might be the new loo-roll, and if people were stockpiling. The question was whether sales were eventually going to come down but “they’ve stayed constantly much, much higher” she says. “This is promising because it means that maybe a shift is really starting to happen. I think those empty shelves in March and April were a bit of a wake-up call for a lot of people there’s a groundswell going on. That’s very exciting.“There are brilliant things going on in every single city,” she adds. “There are community gardens and community allotments. If people don’t have a garden or access to land, there are a lot of initiatives to get engaged on all sorts of levels. I would really urge them to see what is going on in the community.”For the seed s in Stroud and across the country, the quiet, radical work of drying seeds on window ledges and in airing cupboards continues. Cowgill says the process is “good for the soul” and extends an open invitation to other would-be growers to begin playing in the soil, with potentially hugely positive consequences for the inidual and the planet.She sums up the impact of seed-saving in the context of 2020: “It’s difficult times we are living in. We have got a pandemic, we’ve got climate change, we’ve got bioersity loss, habitat loss and economic collapse as well. It might feel quite small, just saving beans and growing your own food, but actually I think it is really fundamental.“By doing something infinitesimally small like this tiny little gesture in a tiny little group, in a tiny little country somewhere, you are working towards something that makes you feel more hopeful. It’s a positive step. I’m not saying this is a magic wand or a cure-all, but it’s a positive step.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/752f5b1f78b95825f6791ede07e159aeec086920/0_48_1580_949/master/1580.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=62bc4bcbfd40e77b9778929b59112a0c","title":"hidden lives the animals behind the products we consume photo essay","story":"Photojournalists capture the often unseen side of the meat, fur and entertainment industries, in a collection co-edited by  collaborator Jo-Anne McArthurHidden: Animals in the Anthropocene is a collection of work by 40 photojournalists from around the world, documenting the lives of animals used for research, entertainment and food. “The animals we use most in our daily lives are hidden. They’re hidden away in factory farms, fur farms, and in labs that use them in research and testing,” says photographer Jo-Anne McArthur, who co-edited the collection. “They are also hidden euphemistically we don’t say we’re eating a calf, for example. We say we’re eating veal.”“As animal rights activists, our battle is against the powerful enterprises that have normalised the torment and killing of billions of animals for food, clothing, entertainment and experimentation each year. Like conflict photographers documenting war and other humanitarian crises, the brave photojournalists featured in this book deserve our acclaim.Their work has made it impossible for exploitative industries to plausibly deny the agony and suffering taking place behind closed doors, deliberately kept out of the public consciousness,” write McArthur and her co-editor Keith Wilson in the book published at the end of last year.Photographs of farmed and captive animals are subject to many legal restrictions and are mostly at the discretion of the company owner. Animal photojournalism is an emerging genre of photography that “captures, exposes and memorialises the experiences of these animals who we never see”, the book says. “It is certainly dangerous, not so much from stray bullets or IEDs, but from the emotional and mental impact caused by witnessing animal death on a scale that is far greater than from any human conflict,” says Wilson.“Animal industries should be transparent because they serve the public, but they are just the opposite, with multimillion dollar lobbying efforts keeping their exploits concealed,” says McArthur. “Concentrated animal feeding operations and other industries that use animals do not want cameras around.”“From public and environmental health crises to zoonotic viruses, animals are inextricably linked to many areas of current global concern, and rightfully so. Our existence is intertwined, and the ethics of how we treat the other sentient beings with whom we share this planet are being called into question,” says McArthur.“We are always hiding animals from ourselves. We build walls and euphemisms to cover any discomfort we might have. If we were to face the animals we keep in crates and cages, and spend some time examining their lives there, and why they are there, we may not be able to enjoy ham or foie gras,” says McArthur.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

There have been several studies to assess the ecological feasibility of bringing back lynx that’s the easy bit in many ways.“The question with a large predator is less about science and more about people’s attitudes, beliefs and priorities. A prerequisite for any discussion over lynx is we need to know the Scottish public are in support of this and would tolerate this.”The scheme faces heavy opposition from Scottish farmers, who cite the loss of about 20,000 sheep in Norway to its native predators, the wolverine, lynx, bear and wolf. The National Farmers Union of Scotland (NFUS) said lynx were blamed for a fifth of those losses.Martin Kennedy, the deputy vice-president of the NFUS, said: “Predation in Norway has reduced over the past decade – not because of fewer predators, but the fact that hill farmers have simply stopped keeping sheep.“The Norwegians told us that to reintroduce predators into our country would be an absolute catastrophe. Their experience has simply strengthened our resolve.”It is thought that if the survey and engagement campaign, called Lynx for Scotland, succeeds in providing enough public support, an application for a licence to release the first of up to 40 lynx into the wild could be made in about five years.A cluster of densely forested Highland estates in the Cairngorms, including estates owned by Povlsen and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds reserve at Abernethy, are seen as the most likely sites for a pilot project.Rausing and Povlsen, now Scotland’s largest private landowners, have championed rewilding projects on their estates, embarking on reforesting projects, banning driven grouse shooting, deer control programmes and conserving persecuted birds of prey.The lynx would be tagged and closely monitored, mirroring a long-running official programme to reintroduce families of beavers in Scotland at Knapdale forest in Argyll, which began in 2009 despite vocal opposition by some local landowners.Cairns said the partnership was not considering a licence application at this stage. “After 12 or 14 months, it may be that the evidence suggests the Scottish public isn’t yet ready for lynx. In which case we have to walk away from it,” Cairns said.There are fears that rewilding activists could attempt to release lynx in Scotland unlawfully unless an official scheme gathers momentum.The Knapdale beaver project was quickly overshadowed by a bitter row with farmers in Tayside about the rapid spread of beavers released illegally or accidentally in the area. Almost 90 beavers were shot under licence in the first eight months of licensed culling in 2019, with many others secretly killed.The most significant hurdle facing a lynx reintroduction programme is meeting strict environmental and policy tests laid down by NatureScot, the government conservation agency, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.The agency’s rules require licence applicants to prove the new species can survive naturally but its release also avoid conflicts with local land users, such as sheep or chicken farmers, by causing “unacceptable harm to people’s wellbeing, livelihoods and recreational activities”.Dr Fraser MacDonald, a geographer at the University of Edinburgh who specialises in land use and population, said the lynx project had to allay fears it was promoting an elitist concept of rewilding, driven by the interests of powerful landowners.“If ecological restoration is to succeed – to survive as more than a laird’s whim in 2021 – then it has to build support from precisely those communities who are likely to be affected,” Macdonald said. “Its implications are so far-reaching that it requires much greater democratic scrutiny.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73cf5ce3c60221291c1eb789651c68152a057740/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=980\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a75c1fc88be39751d8fe47a61187e4a 980w","title":"asylum seekers stranded mexico joe biden","story":"The president-elect has promised to do away with ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy, raising hopes that asylum seekers claims will be treated seriouslySelma López, 31, has spent nearly a year holed up in a two-room house not far from Mexico’s border with the US, along with her 11-year-old son Darikson and another woman who also made the long journey from Honduras in search of a new life.They are among thousands of people stranded south of the frontier by a Trump administration policy known as migrant protection protocols (MPP), which obliges asylum seekers to await their court hearings in some of Mexico’s most dangerous cities, instead of in the US.Children and adults have been raped, kidnapped and murdered while awaiting their court date. In Piedras Negras, police routinely harass migrants, said López. Earlier this week, a mysterious white car followed her as she walked to the store. And as a Garifuna woman, she has suffered overt racism and anti-Black insults from locals.But López’s mood brightens when conversation turned to the US presidential inauguration – and what it might mean for her and thousands of others.“We’re encouraged and feeling a little hopeful,” said López, who fled northern Honduras after gangsters threatened to kill Darikson for not making protection payments. “It’s giving us a little hope that we can at least enter the US and fight our cases there.”Joe Biden has promised to do away with MPP and restore the asylum process, raising hopes among MPP participants that their claims will be treated seriously – and that they won’t have to risk their lives while waiting.Biden plans to restore asylum and refugee programs and officials from the incoming administration say MPP will be addressed in an executive order in the near future.But they cautioned it could take months to address all the changes to the immigration system introduced by Trump.Activists on the border have tried to temper migrants’ enthusiasm.“They think things are going change immediately. I’m trying to make them understand it’s not that easy,“ said Israel Rodríguez, a Baptist pastor, who feeds migrants in Piedras Negras.Piedras Negras, a city of factories opposite Eagle Pass, Texas, attracted asylum seekers because of safety perceptions, according to Rodrigúez. But MPP participants must attend hearings in Laredo, Texas, a journey of 125 miles through cartel territory.The threats do not just come from criminals: police in Piedras Negras regularly detain and extort migrants – and even destroy immigration documents. The local government has closed down migrant shelters under the pretext of the coronavirus and in December ordered them from providing hot meals for migrants left homeless.“They’re making charity illegal,” said Dominican brother Obed Cuellar, director of a diocesan migrant shelter. “There’s a way of thinking here that migrants come to destroy the city or make it dirty … or they’re taking our jobs.”Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, came to office promising not to do the US’s “dirty work” on migration matters. But he immediately went along with the MPP scheme and promised to provide the participants and their children with access to health and education, employment opportunities and shelter.Lawyers and activists say little of that help has materialized, but volunteers from Mexico and the US have provided MPP participants with everything from food and clothing to legal and medical advice.Within Mexico, MPP largely went unnoticed as its participants were largely out of sight and out of mind. But a lawyer representing a number of MPP participants said the program served its purpose for the Trump administration, however.“The cornerstone of MPP is xenophobia. And it worked because 68,000 people were kept out of the US,” said Charlene D’Cruz, a border fellow for Lawyers for Good Government’s Project Corazon.“What MPP did was show people stuck at the border and that was enough for Trump’s base to say that he did what he set out to do: keep all the ‘Mexican rapists’ out.”The pictures from Matamoros – tucked into the extreme north-east corner of Mexico – were at times shocking as MPP participants lived in the squalor of a tent camp along the Rio Grande.The camp has been flooded out, infested with snakes and insects and eventually infiltrated by criminal groups – which charge $500 for permission to cross the frontier and inflict severe beatings on those not paying.But people at the camp felt they had particular reason for optimism: in December 2019 Jill Biden came here and helped serve meals to the migrants.“This is the only place along the border the now first lady visited. That’s why they’re so hopeful,” said Juan Sierra.“We think Biden is going to push an immigration reform,” said José Luis Guerra, a skinny Cuban. “With Trump, there wasn’t any reason for hope.”Additional reporting by Amanda Holpuch"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230ad66072c6278c7c1b5df05543e7d08d4af03e/0_178_5500_3301/master/5500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d93294c089c2132448dbf4cf221980b2","title":"working from bed look professional airline pants all day dressing down","story":"From airline pants to the all-day dressing gown, these outfits are just the thing for those duvet-based video callsDressing for work, if lockdown is forcing you to work from bed, is a dance between comfort and mindset. A nightie suggests you’ve given up, but lip gloss is too much (plus it’s a nightmare if you get it on your sheets). So, how to dress when you don’t want to get dressed? Can you get away with a dressing gown, and what about a hoodie? Follow these tips for bed-based video-call dressing, and you can hunker down in your chrysalis and emerge from it warm, transformed and, hopefully, still employed.No one is suggesting you wear a pinstripe suit to work from bed. But the once salubrious act of wearing your pyjamas all day loses its novelty as some of us march into month 10 of working from home. Daniel Biddulph, a graphic designer who worked from home way before everyone else did, put me on to airline pants. That is, those neutral-coloured sleep-suits-in-bags they give people on first-class flights. Free of those tell-tale pyjama giveaways – lapels, piping, fun checks – yet just as comfortable, they are pyjamas that are designed to be worn in public, planes in effect being dormitories in the sky. Assuming you don’t fly first class, and your support bubble is lacking a pilot, try eBay, where they sell (bagged and unworn) like hot cakes. Biddulph likes Lufthansa’s, which are dark blue. I prefer the British Airways offering, in black cotton polyester.Cocooned in your new “working landscape”, you may soon struggle to differentiate between bed and bedclothes. Is that porridge on your sheet or porridge on you? Did you just use a cushion as a mousepad or is that actually a mouse? Instead, make an ally of your bed by wearing it. Although, be warned, not all blankets are designed to be worn. Frances Kozen, associate director of the Cornell Institute of Fashion and Fibre Innovation, says: “I own a wonderful alpaca Peruvian poncho, but it is definitely an outdoor garment, being without sleeves and a stiffer wool.” As for her wool Colombian ruana, “it’s better, but the open sides make it trickier to wrap up in”. Lightweight woollens, such as her Loki blanket, are good for curling up on the sofa, “but are not machine washable”, she says, with regards to the porridge incident above. Blankets in fleece and plush are the easiest to wash, and Snuggies and Comfies are designed for bed-working, but none of these are good for the environment. Kozen prefers her ankle-length bathrobe when doing business from bed, which brings us nicely on to the next item.Beard wears a necklace with hers when she is teaching from home at Cambridge. “It’s guaranteed to trick them into thinking that you really have got properly dressed – because who wears a necklace with their dressing gown?” the academic and broadcaster said recently.As someone who has worn a gown to a funeral and a wedding, both times without detection, I have realised that dressing gowns are all about context. Worn without its tie, it’s an open wrap dress. Worn over clothes, it’s a cardigan. Worn over pyjamas, it’s very much a dressing gown, though for Coward “the naughty implication of the bedroom” can be a plus.Once upon a time (early 2020) wearing a hoodie to work outside the San Francisco Bay Area would have seemed ludicrous. Post-pandemic, a wardrobe of tracksuits and T-shirts has become fully acceptable. Devin Kohli works in the City of London but, like many of his colleagues, has long ditched the suit and tie. “I’m a venture capitalist … so I wear jeans and a hoodie.” So, too, does Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Ken Leung’s character, Eric, in the HBO hit Industry. His purple hoodie screamed maverick, outsider and self-appointed mentor, in that order.

Anyone flying into the UK is required to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off. International arrivals have to quarantine for 10 days unless they test negative after five days.Travel corridors allowing arrivals from certain destinations with low rates of Covid-19 to avoid quarantine were introduced in July last year, the month after the government moved to implement quarantine restrictions on international arrivals. There have been frequent changes to the corridors in recent months, with countries dropped from the list as infection rates have fluctuated.At PMQs, Starmer said the government was not disputing Patel’s version of events, asking: “Why did the prime minister overrule the home secretary?”Johnson ignored the question, saying only that the UK had “introduced one of the toughest border regimes in the world”. The PM added: “I’m delighted that he now praises the home secretary.”Starmer asked the same question again, which Johnson avoided for a second time.Last March the Daily  reported that Patel and Johnson were embroiled in a row over closing borders, with the prime minister said to have refused a plea from the home secretary to halt flights to the UK.Responding to Patel’s latest comments, the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: “This is a shocking admission from the home secretary about the government’s failure to secure the UK’s borders against Covid.“Priti Patel’s admission, coupled with the complete lack of strategy for testing of travellers, means that the government has left our doors open to the virus and worrying mutations. Ministers now need to urgently review and overhaul border policy, whilst taking responsibility for the huge damage their incompetence has done to our national safety and security.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have strong measures in place at the border, which are vital as we roll out the vaccine.”In a damning report last year, MPs concluded that the government’s failure to impose special border measures in the run-up to the first Covid lockdown was “a serious mistake” that significantly increased the pace and scale of the epidemic.From late January to mid-March 2020, the UK introduced a series of travel measures, including quarantining 273 people mainly from Wuhan, as well as issuing non-mandatory guidance to self-isolate for 14 days to travellers coming from designated high-risk countries. The list of locations, which was incrementally expanded, included China, Iran and Italy by mid-March. But it was withdrawn on 13 March without a reason being given and there were no border measures in place for almost three months until 8 June, according to the report published in August by the Commons’ home affairs committee.In the 10 days between the withdrawal of guidance and the introduction of lockdown on 23 March, the report stated, evidence suggested that thousands of new infections were brought in from Europe. “It is highly likely that this contributed to the rapid increase in the spread of the virus in mid-March and to the overall scale of the outbreak in the UK,” they concluded. Responding to Patel’s latest comments, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs committee which produced the report, said: “I have been raising the issue of the UK’s weak border measures with the home secretary and the government repeatedly since last March and up until now everyone has defended the decisions made at the start of the pandemic not to have stricter border and quarantine measures in place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0ef5d156a7c5d97574d1888a3a000eeb9f09b7/0_0_5242_3496/master/5242.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=df278a618ea55bf4784761b85a9b83bb","title":"lost on the frontline covid nurse coronavirus","story":"Yolanda Coar was 40 when she died of Covid-19 in August 2020 in Augusta, Georgia.

We have been making this point to the government repeatedly over the past few weeks.“It is important to understand that this issue is about one specific use of these tests. We support the principle of using them for general mass testing of students and staff because this process should pick up at least a proportion of asymptomatic cases and improve safety. Our concern was purely over the idea of using them as a worse alternative to the existing self-isolation system for close contacts.“Unfortunately, the government’s insistence on first trying to use them in this way and then having to do yet another policy reversal will have thoroughly confused parents, pupils and the wider public. Schools will once again be left having to unpick the confusion caused by the government.”Barton said mass testing was an important way of keeping schools open but that it was important for the government to provide clarity about the limitations of lateral flow tests, which provide results in 30 minutes but have failed to detect a significant proportion of infections in some trials.He added: “They are useful in detecting asymptomatic cases but they are not definitive and it is vital that iniduals continue to follow the normal safety procedures even if they have a negative result.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Rays were once the standard diet of Dublin\u0026rsquos Ringsend, dubbed \u0026lsquoRaytown\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4463451.1611166500!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north faces abyss when brexit grace period ends hauliers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe first of the so-called grace periods – which limits the amount of bureaucracy applied some goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland, such as those going to supermarkets – is due to end on March 31st. Photograph: PAThe North is facing an “abyss” once the Brexit “grace period” on imports from Britain ends unless action is taken, one of its major haulage companies has warned. “Northern Ireland’s going to get worse in April if we don’t get some easement,” said Paul Jackson of McBurney Transport in Ballymena, Co Antrim. “As a haulage business this is currently an unsustainable model, and we have to be engaged with directly and we have to have it sorted out before the first of April, we have to.” Mr Jackson was among a number of hauliers and industry representatives who gave evidence to the Stormont Infrastructure Committee on Wednesday on the issues facing the sector after Brexit.The first of the so-called grace periods – which limits the amount of bureaucracy applied some goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland, such as those going to supermarkets – is due to end on March 31st. The hauliers outlined their grave concerns around the financial losses incurred by their sector in the North due to the new customs requirements and additional delays since the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31st, and warned some firms could be forced out of business. They also highlighted the impact of delays on the health and wellbeing of drivers, and criticised waiting times and the level of checks at Dublin Port, as well as the available facilities. Mr Jackson said one of his drivers had waited at the port for 32 hours on the first day of the new rules, sand had to ask permission to use the bathroom. ‘A complete mess’“Our operation in Dublin is just a complete mess today, there’s no other nice way of saying it,” Mr Jackson told the Stormont committee. Initial teething problems in the North, they said, were made worse by the lack of readiness of suppliers in Britain, which meant haulage firms had to ship trailers back to Northern Ireland empty. Mr Jackson said that in the first full week of the new arrangements the firm incurred between £67,000 and £73,000 in additional costs, and the first two weeks of January were 24 per cent down compared to January 2020. McBurney Transport has already had to ship back 63 empty trailers. “We’re simply running out of trailers in Northern Ireland. We as a haulage business can’t afford to ship more empty trailers,” Mr Jackson said. “You wouldn’t want many weeks of what we’ve just had. It’s extremely urgent that we plug this, we simplify this.” Daryl Morgan from Morgan McLernon Refrigerated Transport said that in the first week of January his firm had shipped home 70 empty trailers, and 30 last week. “The downturn in trade is evident,” he said. “We, like most Northern Ireland hauliers, have become customs agents,” he said, explaining that he had assigned seven staff members to deal with customs, and he would have to at least double this. Chris Slowey of Manfreight said his firm would have to increase its rates by approximately 12 per cent to cover the additional costs. “That will leave Northern Ireland plc ineffective in the marketplace against a GB manufacturer producing the same goods,” he said. Financial supportPatrick Derry of Derry Refrigerated Transport said there needed to be “financial support for the hauliers ... there’s not enough profit in the business to send trucks out full and come back empty, it just doesn’t financially pay.” The committee agreed to write to the Department regarding a support scheme for the haulage industry, as well as other issues including welfare provision for drivers. The Northern Ireland policy manager for industry body Logistics UK, Seamus Leheny, told the committee the problems at Dublin Port stemmed from IT failures because the UK and Irish systems were not fully integrated, the lack of a similar grace period between imports from Great Britain to the Republic, and the Irish implementation of a 24-hour pre-notification period – rather than the four hours currently enforced in the North – and the application of checks on 30 per cent of goods. Mr Leheny said that the volume of trade via Dublin was “severely down” and businesses in Northern Ireland were avoiding Dublin and instead sending goods to Europe using the Rosslare-Cherbourg route and returning via Calais-Dover. “We’ve got to avoid another cliff-edge, and also there’s a cliff-edge on the parcel sector ... some of our members would carry upwards of 6,000 parcels on a trailer, and it’s clear to say we would struggle on customs entries on that so we need a long-term solution to avoid the need for those declarations, especially business-to-consumer parcels.” SimplificationsAodhán Connolly of Retail NI also said that further mitigations and simplifications were needed to address the challenges faced once the grace periods ended.However he stressed that while there had been some disruption to food supply in Northern Ireland due to a “perfect storm” of Brexit and other factors including Covid-19, shortages had only ever affected several hundred items out of 40,000-50,000 that might be stocked in a large supermarket, and while there were clearly issues a “good supply of products” was regularly reaching stores in the North. “We had people saying that the supply chain was a few days from collapse, that’s not helpful. The supply chain is not and has never been a few days away from collapse and I think that needs underlined because it’s simply not true and it’s a bit reckless to be saying that.” Appearing before the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee, also on Wednesday, the North’s Secretary of State, Brandon Lewis, said in relation to issues affecting hauliers and the importation of goods to Northern Ireland that he was seeking to get “a fixed permanent solution” before the grace period ends. He indicated guidance on how the matters might be addressed would be issued shortly by the British government.  How is Brexit affecting you?

The strict measures were initially introduced until the end of this January after case numbers increased sharply following the relaxation of restrictions in the lead-up to Christmas. Officials in the Department of Education have begun exploring whether schools can reopen on February 1st, although the delay in reopening schools for children with special needs has dampened the prospects of agreement being reached for other schools.Sources have said the department will follow whatever is advised by the State’s public health team including advice on whether mobility has reduced enough to allow schools to reopen safely.It is understood the hospitality sector may not reopen properly until late May or early June. Restaurants and cafes had hoped to be in a position to reopen outdoors in April but this is now being viewed as increasingly unlikely.Senior figures in the industry are understood to have recently asked Government if a reopening would be possible after the end of March when the most vulnerable people in the country have been vaccinated against Covid 19 but were told this was not likely. This is because the risk would still be too high with around 80 per cent of the population still needing a vaccine at that stage. The emergence of new highly transmissible variants of coronavirus have further complicated matters.Meanwhile, childcare providers have called on the Government to give clarity on its reopening plans for the sector.Seas Suas, the representative body for independent early learning and care providers in Ireland, wrote to Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman on Tuesday evening asking for “clarity on the plan for childcare post 31 January” asking “will the childcare sector reopen for all children or are we required to continue to provide education and care for the children of essential and frontline workers only.”The group also asked the Department to “provide detail of what funding measures will be in place from 1 February to support providers who are operating at reduced capacity and occupancy for the children of essential and frontline workers only.”“This should include a substantial upfront payment on account to replace scheme funding payments due on 29th January to assist cashflow to meet wages and other overheads due in early February.“Now, more than ever, we need decisive leadership and timely policies to safeguard the continued operation of the sector as a whole,” the group said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics covid 19 plans to resume special education postponed","story":"With levels of Covid-19 infection still at an all-time high, the Government failed to get teaching unions on side for a return to school this week for students with additional needs.

File photograph: Matt CardyPA WireThe former British chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne has said Northern Ireland is “heading for the exit door” from the United Kingdom.Writing in the London Evening Standard, where he is now editor-in-chief, Mr Osborne said the North was “slowly becoming part of a united Ireland” and most people in England “will not care”.The former Conservative MP wrote: “By unleashing English nationalism, Brexit has made the future of the UK the central political issue of the coming decade. Northern Ireland is already heading for the exit door.“By remaining in the EU single market, it is for all economic intents and purposes now slowly becoming part of a united Ireland. Its prosperity now depends on its relationship with Dublin (and Brussels), not London. The politics will follow,” he wrote on Tuesday.Mr Osborne said unionists in Northern Ireland had always feared Britain was not sufficiently committed to their cause. “Now their short-sighted support for Brexit (and unbelievably stupid decision to torpedo Theresa May’s deal that avoided separate Irish arrangements) has made those fears a reality. It pains me to report that most here and abroad will not care.” The departure of Scotland from the UK would be a more serious matter, he implies, and it would represent the end of the United Kingdom “with no disrespect to the Welsh”.He said the worst evening he spent in Downing Street was on September 18th, 2014, awaiting the results of the Scottish independence referendum with then prime minister David Cameron.“We thought: are we the people who have lost Scotland? History allows for no recovery from a disaster like that. Ask Lord North, the prime minister condemned for all time for the loss of America. “The mistake he made — and with Irish calls for home rule a century later — had been to assume that doing nothing was an option. Our referendum was a proactive plan to keep the United Kingdom together — and it looked like it had put Scottish nationalism back in its box for a generation.” But Brexit, and its unleashing of English nationalism, had ensured this was no longer the case, he said. Mr Osborne said those who want to keep the UK together need to respond with new, powerful arguments against separation. “After all, hasn’t the EU negotiations shown Scots that the whip hand lies with the larger, more powerful bloc?” Advising British prime minister Boris Johnson, Mr Osborne said he should refuse to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence. “It’s the only sure way you won’t lose one,” he added.“Just say no, Boris, and save yourself a long anxious night in Downing Street.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4463456.1611166784!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach congratulates biden on inauguration as us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin also congratulated the inauguration of the first female vice-president Kamala Harris.

He is one of us, part of our global family.”With hopes of yet another presidential visit to Ireland now high, the Taoiseach said he looked forward to welcoming Mr Biden and working with him in the areas of global peace, climate change, economic partnership and stability.“I also wish to pay tribute to vice-president Kamala Harris, who has created history today, and who will help form a erse and formidable administration,” he said.“I believe Ireland can be a bridge-builder between the United States and the European Union as we all share common values in securing democracy, peace and economic development.“I am enormously heartened that among his first actions in office will be a re-commitment of the US to the Paris Agreement on climate, and a resetting of the relationship with Europe. ”Four people have died after supporters of outgoing US president Donald Trump invaded the US Capitol in an extraordinary attack on the heart of American democracy on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4463381.1611164251!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democracy has prevailed joe biden sworn in as 46th us president","story":"Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on the West Front of the US Capitol and Kamala Harris is sworn in as vice president, becoming the first woman to hold the second highest office in the US.

Photograph: Rob CarrGetty ImagesJoe Biden has been sworn in as the 46th president of the United States in a ceremony in at the US Capitol in Washington DC.“Through a crucible for the ages, America has been tested anew, and America has risen to the challenge,” Mr Biden said as he began his inaugural address. “Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause: the cause of democracy.”“We’ve learned again that democracy is precious. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.”After a bitter campaign marked by former president Donald Trump’s baseless allegations of election fraud, Mr Biden struck a conciliatory tone, asking Americans who did not vote for him to give him a chance to be their president as well.“To overcome these challenges to restore the soul and secure the future of America requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: unity,” he said.“We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this – if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts.”Mr Biden now assumes the helm of a country reeling from deep political ides, a battered economy and a raging coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 Americans.Ready to serve.— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) With his hand on an heirloom Bible that has been in his family for more than a century, Mr Biden took the presidential oath of office administered by US Chief Justice John Roberts, vowing to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States”.Kamala Harris made history just a few minutes earlier when she was sworn in as Mr Biden’s vice president, becoming the first woman, the first Black American and the first Asian American to hold the second highest US office. Ms Harris was sworn in by US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court’s first Latina member.Mr Biden (78) became the oldest US president in history at a scaled-back ceremony in Washington that was largely stripped of its usual pomp and circumstance, due both to the pandemic and security concerns following the January 6th assault on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.Mr Biden arrived at the Capitol just before 3.30pm Irish time for his inauguration after a visit to church, where he was joined in a show of unity by the two most senior Republicans in Congress: senator Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives minority leader Kevin McCarthy.Mr Trump flouted one last convention on his way out. His refusal to attend his successor’s swearing-in breaks with more than a century and a half of political tradition, seen as a way of affirming the peaceful transfer of power.The former president did, however, leave a customary note for Mr Biden in the Oval Office, according to a White House official, though it was not yet known what it said.FortificationThe ceremony unfolded in front of a heavily fortified US Capitol, where a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building two weeks ago, fired up by his false claims that the November 3rd election was stolen with millions of fraudulent votes.The violence, which left five dead, prompted the Democratic-controlled US House to impeach Mr Trump last week for an unprecedented second time.Thousands of National Guard troops were stationed on Wednesday around the Capitol, where barbed wire topped high fences and both guests and members of the press passed through multiple checkpoints. Access was strictly limited and required a government-conducted Covid-19 test within 48 hours of arrival.Former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton, as well as their spouses attended the ceremony. Mr Pence and other top Republicans were on hand as well.Instead of a throng of supporters, the National Mall was covered by nearly 200,000 flags and 56 pillars of light meant to represent people from US states and territories. – ReutersFour people have died after supporters of outgoing US president Donald Trump invaded the US Capitol in an extraordinary attack on the heart of American democracy on Wednesday.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4463065.1611137615!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joe biden s presidency might be liberal democracy s last chance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president-elect Joe Biden speaking in New Castle, Delaware, on Tuesday. Photograph: Evan VucciAPThe current militarisation of downtown Washington is a propaganda gift to autocrats everywhere. This, they will say of the khaki vans and camouflaged guards, is where liberalism ends: civil strife a besieged state. The grimmest thing about the show of strength is that it is probably warranted.It is not as if the world’s authoritarians need the reputational boost. New data confirm that China’s economy did more than merely avoid recession last year. Its Covid-19 vaccines have takers from Indonesia to Hungary via the Gulf and, neatly inverting the Sino-Soviet split of the 1970s, Beijing has struck an investment deal with the EU. Those sounds you hear are the first notes of transatlantic discord over the emergent superpower.Such is the world that confronts Joe Biden as he takes office on Wednesday. Not since 1945, when Harry Truman felt the weight of the “moon, the stars and all the planets”, has more rested on a new US president.If he governs well, mending the economy, dispensing vaccines, and calming the home front, he can stem the trickling away of US (and by extension western) credibility since the millennium. What started with the US’s “forever wars” and worsened with the 2008 financial crash reached a negative apotheosis with the still-raging pandemic. The west needs a success story for its own morale as much as its outward reputation.If, on the other hand, Biden fails, the sense of Chinese momentum will start to feel less like form and more like destiny. Countries with systems somewhere between multi-party democracy and absolutism might come to see the second as this century’s strong horse. Within the US, the soil will be fertilised for a populist comeback – an abler Donald Trump – in the 2024 election, with all that implies for domestic peace and intra-western comity. There is a circularity to decline.Moral creditReaders are entitled to yawn when every presidency is vaunted as a hinge moment for the world. Looking back, perhaps it did not matter all that much whether George HW Bush or Bill Clinton won the 1992 election. Bar the handling of Russian sensitivities post-cold war, that decade did not require miraculous feats of statecraft. The US had moral credit to spare, and such supremacy that it was neither easy nor worthwhile to identify the second mightiest country.But if the hype has been too breathless in the past, the easier mistake now is to understate things. Whether we look back on the early 21st century as the moment of eclipse for the west, or just a bad run, depends in large part on Biden’s performance.A man whose selling point was his nondescriptness, and an implied promise of respite between the stress of Trump and a bolder Democrat to come, will have to do more. His expansive schemes for fiscal relief and pandemic control suggest that he understands this. But they are schemes. He, and liberal democracy itself, will be judged on a factor that has been elusive over the past two decades: competence.To make his inheritance yet worse, Biden takes charge of the US at the most awkward phase in the superpower lifecycle. Its relative strength has waned but not so much as to elevate, even remotely, another leader of the free world. The US remains the anchor of the international system. Its domestic life is still, to a frankly weird extent, the planet’s binge watch (hence protests in Paris about a police killing in Minneapolis). Its failures become those of liberalism entire, at least in the agitprop of the autocratic world. In the past, America’s compensation for these burdens was a commensurate amount of power. Now, the two are gallingly misaligned.In that sense, perhaps not even 1945 does justice to the gauntlet awaiting Biden. As cowed as Truman felt, the US was a coming force, and an internally coherent one. He was working with the grain of history. A human lifetime later, the US has a smaller share of world output and counts a peaceful transition of presidential rule as a comment-worthy achievement. A large majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives voted not to certify the election of Biden, even after the Capitol siege.As a rule of thumb, a democracy is in good health to the extent that its politics do not matter. Ideally, the spread of outcomes from a new president should be a slightly better healthcare system or a slightly worse one. Biden’s spread is nothing less than the shoring up of liberalism’s good name, or the extension of its malaise, until it hardens into fate. There is an air of the last chance about this presidency. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Eric Trump says he will \u0026#39never forget Buckingham Palace\u0026#39 as family seen in tears at farewell ceremonyPandemic intensifies malnutrition in Asia as UN warns almost two billion cannot afford healthy dietChina sanctions 28 people linked to Trump administration, including Mike PompeoCoronavirus latest news: Record daily deaths as Sir Patrick Vallance warns hospitals are like \u0026#39war zones\u0026#39Hunter Biden: the president\u0026#39s second son who was the target of Donald Trump\u0026#39s attacksInauguration Day 2021 news: Joe Biden says \u0026#39Democracy has prevailed\u0026#39 as he is sworn in as 46th US President – live updatesStorm Christoph: Prime Minister to chair Cobra meeting as two months of rain expected in two daysShared \u0026#39suffering\u0026#39 by fans of the worst Premier League teams creates \u0026#39strong social glue\u0026#39, study findsMinisters fear Storm Christoph could hit Covid vaccine rolloutComment: The EU\u0026#39s deal with China will enrich and embolden the largest human rights abuser in the worldPresident Joe Biden\u0026#39s: what will his first 100 days in office look like?London mayor took advantage of pandemic to introduce \u0026#39unlawful\u0026#39 road closures and cycle lanes, judge findsWhat will Donald Trump do now?

However, they can be given the jab if they are in a high-risk group.Pregnant women in the US can have the jab if they want, while Gulf states are vaccinating all citizens.It came as two of the Israel\u0027s healthcare providers said they would begin vaccinating all Israelis under the age of 35, widening the criteria for the jab even further.According to the Times of Israel, some officials want the priority system to be scrapped and offer the jab to all adults as there are enough vaccines.To date, Israel has given the first of two jabs to around a quarter of its 9m-strong population, while half a million citizens have received their second jab.Hundreds of reserve combat medics have been deployed to assist nurses as they administer tens of thousands of jabs across the country each day. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, revealed this week he had mounted the syringe used to give him the first vaccine in a glass box in his office.“This is the syringe that gave me the first vaccine out of the millions of vaccines that we brought to Israel,” he said in a video clip posted on Facebook. On Tuesday the country set a new daily record for inoculations, giving out 200,000 doses. That is the pace to defeat the mutation! said Yuli Edelstein, the health minister, in a post on Twitter. Despite the vaccine rollout success, Israel recorded 10,000 coronavirus infections over 24 hours on Monday, the highest rate for the country so far in the pandemic. The Jewish state is currently in its third nationwide lockdown, which has been extended until the end of January.

So, we said we can do it in the second quarter. They agreed to it, AK Abdul Momen, Bangladesh’s foreign affairs minister told reporters. He said China and Myanmar had accepted Dhaka\u0027s proposal of allowing international observers, but added that Myanmar would only start off with 42,000 out of 830,000 refugees who had already been biometrically verified by Bangladesh, reported the local Daily Star. The tentative deal leaves unanswered questions about rights and security guarantees for the Rohingya, although Mr Momen said he had stressed the need to create the right conditions to ensure “voluntary repatriation.”Two previous attempts in 2018 and 2019 collapsed over refugees’ safety fears. A statement about the meeting issued by Naypyidaw claimed that “Myanmar has made all necessary arrangements for the repatriation” reported Radio Free Asia. The two sides agreed to hold a follow-up meeting in first week of February. China continues to insist the issue is “bilateral,” demanding the international community refrain from “further complicating the situation.”However, Bangladesh has stressed it needs international help to find a lasting solution. In exclusive comments to The  ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, Mr Momen expressed frustration not only at foot-dragging by Myanmar which had “the moral and legal responsibility to end this crisis” but also at the United Nations and wider international community.  “We are trying hard bilaterally, trilaterally and even multilaterally to end the plight of these persecuted people. We approached the UN also but except lip service and tall talks, none could ameliorate the plight of Rohingyas,” he said. Mr Momen urged rights groups and the UN to dedicate more efforts to “convincing Myanmar to create a conducive environment inside Rakhine province” where the Rohingya had lived for centuries. “Their focus should be to help rehabilitate them and achieve a decent and secure life in their own country,” he said.  “It is unfortunate that although Myanmar is violating human rights and engaged in ethnic cleansing, many countries instead of sanctioning and stopping business and investment in Myanmar, in fact, increased it. “When apartheid was being practiced in South Africa, many human rights groups and organisations made clarion calls for estment, organised campus demonstrations against apartheid and due to such pressure, apartheid ended,” he said.  “Rights groups should focus and commit their resources to end persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar.”In December, Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur for Myanmar, admitted the international community had failed to create the conditions in Myanmar for a safe return and to adequately support Bangladesh.Dhaka has borne much of the burden of the mass outflow of refugees in 2017 as they fled the horrors of a military crackdown that UN investigators said would justify the prosecution of top generals for “genocide.” Myanmar denies this charge and the accusation of ethnic cleansing. Among Bangladesh’s own proposals to tackle the “trust deficit” between the Rohingya and the Myanmar government Dhaka has suggested Naypyitaw send its officials to the Bangladeshi camps to reassure them, and that non-military civilian observers be allowed into Rakhine state. Matthew Smith, chief executive officer of Fortify Rights, pointed out that Myanmar still confines more than 125,000 Rohingya to more than 20 internment camps in five townships of Rakhine State, adding that Myanmar was still “a dangerous place to be a Muslim.”He added: “Myanmar needs to take its military boots off the necks of Rohingya. For voluntary, safe and dignified returns, at a minimum Naypyidaw would need to amend the 1982 Citizenship Law,” which deprives the Rohingya of citizenship.“Before any serious talk of repatriation, Naypyidaw should close down the internment camps, provide reparations, and support Rohingya to rebuild in their places of origin.”The UNHCR on Wednesday said it welcomed the discussions as “crucial to making progress” for a “safe, voluntary and sustainable return.”But it added that the Rohingya should have a seat at the table. “Many Rohingya refugees tell us they want to return home to Myanmar when conditions permit, and they are asking to be consulted as part of the repatriation process,” said a spokesperson. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"palace four reveal whether meghan markle gave private information","story":"The “Palace Four” will reveal whether the Duchess of Sussex gave private information to the authors of Finding Freedom, indirectly or otherwise, they have confirmed.The four, who were among the Duchess’s closest and most senior aides, insisted they would remain “strictly neutral” and had no interest in helping either side in her legal action against the Mail on Sunday.In a letter lodged with the High Court on their behalf, Samantha Cohen, her former private secretary, Christian Jones, former deputy communications secretary, Jason Knauf, former Kensington Palace communications secretary and Sara Latham, former communications director, said they would also provide evidence about the creation of the letter Meghan sent to her father, as well as the draft, and whether she anticipated that it might be made public.Antony White QC, for Associated Newspapers, owner of the Mail on Sunday, said the group could clearly “shed light” on the issues at stake, noting that the case “cried out” for further investigation at trial.The Duchess is suing Associated for breach of privacy and copyright relating to the publication of five articles, three in the MailOnline and two in the Mail on Sunday, in February 2019.She has applied for summary judgment, a legal step that would negate the need for a trial.In the letter sent on behalf of the “Palace Four” legal firm Addleshaw Goddard said none of them wanted to be involved with the trial, not least due to the sensitivity and discretion involved in their roles within the Royal Household.It added: Nor does any of our clients wish to take sides in the dispute between your respective clients. Our clients are all strictly neutral.They have no interest in assisting either party to the proceedings. Their only interest is in ensuring a level playing field, insofar as any evidence they may be able to give is concerned.The letter continued that their lawyers\u0027 preliminary view is that one or more of our clients would be in a position to shed some light on the creation of the letter and the electronic draft.It said they may be able to shed light on whether or not the claimant anticipated that the letter might come into the public domain and whether or not the Duchess directly or indirectly provided private information, generally and in relation to the letter specifically, to the authors of Finding Freedom.The Duchess has accused Associated of a “triple barrelled” breach of her rights, for publishing extracts of the “private” letter she sent to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.Her legal team has described the letter as “a message of peace,” a desperate plea, begging Mr Markle to stop talking to the press.Mr Markle, 76, described it in rather different terms, revealing in his witness statement that  the critical five-page missive “signalled the end” of their relationship.Mr White said the decision to involve the Kensington Palace communications team in composing the letter “requires careful and penetrating investigation” at trial, suggesting that their input bolstered its claim that the letter was part of a “media strategy”.“Why were they involved at all in the wording of a letter if it was a wholly private letter?” he asked.Mr White also argued that an article published in People magazine, based on interviews with five of Meghan’s friends, “set the scene” for unfolding events.The article, headlined The Truth About Meghan, provided the first public reference to the letter.Mr White noted that the Duchess had admitted the article’s description of the tone and purpose of her letter was inaccurate.“She admits the letter was not an attempt at reconciliation, it was an admonishment,” he said.Four royal aides who will be asked to give evidence in a potential trial have confirmed they will provide information that will shed light on various issues at stake.Jason Knauf, who at the time was communications secretary to both the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, advised Meghan as she wrote the letter to her father.The Duchess has admitted that Mr Knauf, a close confidante who is now chief executive of the Royal Foundation, provided feedback in the form of general ideas.Ted Verity, editor of the Mail on Sunday, said he had been told Mr Knauf worked on the drafts with the Duchess.Samantha Cohen, former private secretary to the Sussexes and long-standing senior royal aide.A former assistant private secretary to the Queen, she is said to have been planning to leave Buckingham Palace in 2018 but agreed to stay on to help guide the Duchess of Sussex through her first months in the Royal Family.The popular Australian left the royal fold in 2019 after almost 18 years of service, to work for environmental charity Cool Earth, later becoming chief executive of the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council.Christian Jones, former deputy communications secretary to the Sussexes who is currently acting private secretary to the Cambridges.The communications specialist who previously worked at the Treasury and on Brexit, is a popular member of the team, heading up the Cambridges’ press office when the two couples formed separate households.He has recently handed in his notice and will head up corporate communications at a private equity firm.Sara Latham, who at the time was the Sussexes’ director of communications and is now a senior Buckingham Palace advisor working on the Platinum Jubilee, is said to have helped “fact check” Finding Freedom, the favourable biography about the Sussexes.Mr Verity said he had been told Ms Latham had assisted the book’s authors, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, by making sure they got nothing wrong.The editor also claimed that a third member of staff,  “a woman called Keleigh” (Thomas Morgan) at Sunshine Sachs, had been responsible for “making calls to open doors” to the authors.More from

teachers instead of isolation are now on pause, the Government has said.A  joint statement from  Public Health England (PHE) and NHS Test and Trace said the balance between the risks and benefits of a daily testing programme in schools was now unclear.The decision comes after the new Covid variant was found to have higher rates of transmission and a higher secondary attack rate, increasing the risk of transmission everywhere, including in school settings.In December, ministers said secondary school pupils and teachers would be able to have daily lateral flow tests for a week if they have come into close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus.That would mean children could continue their education at school rather than entire classes or year groups being sent home to self-isolate for 10 days .But on Wednesday morning, Downing Street officials said NHS Test and Trace and PHE had reviewed their advice, with the decision made in light of the higher prevalence and rates of transmission of the new variant.They said further evaluation is required to make sure that daily testing is achieving its aim of breaking chains of transmission and reducing cases of the virus in the community.Other parts of the testing plan in schools – including two tests a week for teachers and two tests at the start of the school term for pupils – are still due to go ahead when schools reopen, officials said.A Government spokesman said: We are... pausing daily contact testing in all but a small number of secondary schools and colleges, where it will continue alongside detailed evaluation.The statement from PHE and NHS Test and Trace, published on Wednesday morning, said: In light of this changing situation, we now recommend that the rollout of daily contact testing within schools is paused, other than for schools involved in further evaluation.This will enable the further detailed evaluation of changing circumstances including, potentially, lower infection rates and modelling work required to understand the benefits of daily contact testing in the this new phase of the pandemic.Schools should continue to test their staff regularly – twice weekly where possible, in line with recommendations for other workforces that need to leave the home to work – and test pupils twice upon return to school, as has been the case since the start of January.More from

Shuang who found herself at the center of a surrogacy controversy this week after alleged details of her life went viral on social media.  Zheng’s former partner on Monday accused her of abandoning two surrogate children in the United States in a post on his Weibo account, according to Chinese newspaper, The Global Times.News of the alleged surrogacy was met with uproar in China, where surrogacy is illegal, although wealthy citizens may travel abroad to pursue it.Amid the internet fury, the Italian fashion house made a brief announcement on its Sina Weibo account on Tuesday, a social media platform in China that is similar to Facebook and Twitter.The post simply said that Prada had “terminated” its cooperation with the 29 year-old actress. The Global Times reported that news linked to the scandal and surrogacy content on Weibo achieved 4.2 billion views on Tuesday.Zheng has not confirmed or denied the report.The outlet said birth certificates for children born in December 2019 and January 2020 in the United States were shared online, and the documents reportedly show Zheng’s name and that of ex-boyfriend Zhang Heng.The Global Times also claimed that a recording had leaked online in which the actress expressed dismay that it was too late at seven months to terminate the pregnancy of her second child.Neither the documents nor the recording have yet been verified as authentic. Zheng has pleaded for privacy, saying: I didn\u0027t violate any state order on Chinese soil. Overseas, I\u0027ve abided by all laws and rules.The Communist Party’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission accused the actress of taking advantage of US law in a Weibo post and said surrogacy exploited women and used their uteruses as “commodity.”  CCTV’s official Weibo account further called her actions “outrageous” and showed a “heinous” disregard for human life for abandoning the children in a post that garnered more than 6.7 million likes and 216,000 comments, many of which criticized Zheng’s actions.China formerly enforced a strict one-child policy for most families, but the rules were later relaxed in 2013.    More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news covid restrictions ban corridors tests uk holidays","story":"Saga plans to begin hotel stays, escorted tours and river cruises in MayShould I book a holiday for spring?Will vaccine passports open up our holidays?How travel to Europe will change after BrexitNew UK testing entry rules: everything you need to knowSign up to the  Travel newsletterCruise and travel operator Saga has outlined its plans to resume holidays – but informed customers that only those who are “fully vaccinated” may travel.

However, Gething told a press conference in Cardiff this afternoon that real falls were being seen in cases of Covid-19 across Wales, including north Wales.Public Health Wales figures show the seven-day incidence rate across Wales has dropped to 285 cases per 100,000 people, while the percentage of people testing positive has reduced to 16.7 per centHow we balance the risk in terms of immunity passports is a question for the politicians, writes Charles Levinson. Testing will remain in place for some time, I suspect, but hopefully the need for quarantine can be scrapped. I’ve long argued that a test before departure and one a couple of days after would massively reduce the risk.

In return for a week in the sun, I don’t think a test is too much to ask until we are fully free of this pandemic.Read the full article – and please tell us your thoughts.Tokyo: the most \u0026#39cityish\u0026#39 of all the cities in the worldDreaded crowds notwithstanding, it\u0027s often best to go big or go home when it comes to travel, says Annabel Fenwick-Elliott. Santorini. The first place I’ll flee to as soon as restrictions lift is to the lonesome South African bush. But there is one metropolis I’m keen to tick off before I die, crowds notwithstanding, and that is Tokyo. It appeals to the somewhat unhealthy all-or-nothing aspect of my character. Before I write cities off altogether, it would surely be prudent to first experience the most cityish of all the cities in the world: Tokyo.Where in the world will you travel first?Quite a lot, it seems.At Rockliffe Hall in County Durham, staff have turned their attention to supporting local community causes – by delivering takeaway afternoon tea to hospital workers, and litter picking along the River Tees.They have also donated hundreds of toiletries to Darlington Memorial Hospital.Hotel staff delivering complimentary afternoon tea to local key workersThe landscape of Algeria\u0026#39s slice of the Sahara is unforgettable I step out of the car to take in the panorama.

Follow the inauguration ceremony on our live blog, or watch live below.Cast your mind back to last March 23, 2020, writes Emma Featherstone.It was the first day we were told to “stay at home”. The city emptied of office workers. Tourists retreated. Shops, hotels and attractions shut. The exodus from London’s streets was stark. Images of an empty Piccadilly Square and deserted Trafalgar Square filled newspaper pages.Piccadilly Circus, usually littered with tourists, stands empty at the start of the latest lockdownNow in our third lockdown, London, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the UK economy, is once again disconcertingly quiet. Hotels, attractions, restaurants and “non-essential” shops are mostly shuttered. All but essential travel is against Government guidance. As we swiftly head towards the anniversary of the first nationwide closure – for now, lockdown regulations are due to expire on March 31 – how might 12 months of restrictions have left our greatest tourist city?Read the full report here.The Government has amended the new rule requiring all UK-bound passengers to provide evidence of a recent negative Covid test, after reports that some travellers were left stranded at airports. The original rules set out by the Department of Transport simply required passengers to take a test 72 hours before their departure. However, it did not specify whether this referred to the original departure point or any connecting hub – leading to confusion.The Independent has reported that passengers travelling to the UK from Havana via Madrid were denied boarding in the Spanish capital due to their tests being deemed out of date. Under this interpretation of the rules, it seems passengers from New Zealand or Australia with lengthy airport stopovers could easily find themselves breaching the three-day limit if they opt for lab-analysed PCR swabs, which generally take at least 24 to 48 hours to turnaround. The Government rules have since been altered and now read: “You should get a test within three days of your final departure point to England.“But if you have one or more connecting flights to the UK, you should take a test as close as possible to the date of the first flight – if the connecting flights were booked as a single passenger record.”Hotels such as The Hari in London weren\u0026#39t even able to benefit from 2020\u0026#39s summer staycation boomHoteliers across England are urging the Government to reopen hospitality by Easter.With March being touted for a possible lifting of restrictions, Easter – which this year falls on the first weekend of April – will be key for businesses hoping to recover some of the losses they have suffered.Dan Brod, who owns the Beckford Group, which operates four pubs with rooms in the south-west, told  Travel: It is not just a wish but simply an absolute necessity that Government reopens hospitality (that is able to offer some social distancing) by Easter.We must be put in a position where not only can we survive, but we can put back into the economy what we have been helped with by Government.Rachel Cranshaw has the full story.All UK-bound travellers must now provide a negative test for Covid-19 before being allowed to board a plane, train or boat – in addition to going into self-isolation on their arrival.While all non-essential travel is currently prohibited, these new, stricter rules will help the country recover in the long-run, says Ali Shah – CEO of holiday company TravelUP: However, it is crucial that we bring the cost of Covid tests down. At the moment, private tests for Covid-19 cost anything from £60 to over £200. That is too much. We need to work together to make testing as cheap and reliable as possible. One way to bring the cost down would be to introduce batch testing. Up to ten people can be tested at one time. If someone tests positive then you can test iniduals – although, in reality, if a family received a positive result the whole family would simply not travel. That could potentially speed up the process and make things cheaper. The UK has been very slow to adopt this sort of testing regime. I flew back into Heathrow from Pakistan last week and there were no testing procedures in place whatsoever. I filled out a passenger locator form and then went into quarantine for ten days. However, when I had flown out to Pakistan I had to provide a negative Covid PCR test and have my temperature taken. Without showing that negative test result I would not have been allowed to board the flight. Even a mass rollout of vaccines will not solve everything. We have to learn to live with the virus for the foreseeable future. We need testing in place which we can rely on and which will allow people to travel to and from the UK with confidence once again.Walt Disney World Orlando has big plans for its 50th birthday in OctoberThis October marks the 50th anniversary of the Walt Disney World Resort – but what might its celebrations looks like? A \u0027Royal\u0027 makeover, new rides and a Star Wars hotel are among its anniversary plans. International visitors remain on hold with the suspension of all air corridors for the time being, but Florida remains hopeful things can start to resume by the summer – and there are already signs the big Florida hotspot will be back in full \u0027pixie dust\u0027 mode by the autumn.Local reports list bookings at almost 80 per cent for the first quarter of this year, and the arrival of the Covid vaccine has rekindled British interest for the summer and beyond.Chris Bradshaw, sales and marketing director for leading UK ticket agency AttractionTickets, said: “We’ve seen a significant increase in demand for Disney tickets and hotel packages on the back of the successful vaccine announcements.”Simon and Susan Veness have the full story.The Government of St Lucia has banned the general sale of alcohol on the island, in a bid to reduce the transmission of Covid-19. From today, most liquor licences will be cancelled for 21 days – prohibiting the sale of alcohol in supermarkets, bars, restaurants and shops. However, St Lucia\u0027s tourist board has confirmed that the new rules will not affect the sale of alcohol in the country\u0027s hotels – many of which offer all-inclusive rates to holidaymakers.Belgian monks famous for the strict rules they observe in selling their celebrated beers are offering online home delivery for the first time because of the coronavirus pandemic, James Crisp reports. The reclusive brothers of the Saint-Sixtus Abbey in West Flanders only sell as much beer as they need to survive. Drinkers wanting to taste the Westvleteren beers, which are among the most sought after in the world, had to ring at a certain time, provide a number plate and collect a maximum of two crates from the monastery at a prearranged time. The monks will only sell the beer on the condition that the beers are for personal consumption and not for resale. The sale of the Trappist beer is the monks\u0027 only source of income and sales have been hit by the coronavirus lockdown. They ide opinion as they do nations – but for travellers, a border is a potent and poetic threshold of discovery, says Chris Moss: There are shoeshines, a stray dog, the comfort of strangers, no good hotels a car dealer fails to show up. This being Greene there’s a a fugitive millionaire and a couple of agents on his tail. There is languor there is tension. I read Greene’s story years before I crossed the border from Tijuana into San Diego – by accident, as it happens, because the bullying traffic jostled me and siphoned me over. I did a speedy U-turn and came right back to Mexico. Give me danger and dodginess over a zoo, every time.

Reporting them today.”However, Airbnb has issued a statement emphasising that stays are only offered ‘in line with Government guidance’.It reads: ‘There are lockdowns in place across Scotland and stays on Airbnb are only available in limited circumstances, in line with government guidance. This is made clear on our website, which restricts bookings to these legal exemptions.’The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has called for the introduction of a digital European Covid-19 vaccination certification, joining a growing number of tour operators, airlines and travel companies around the world. In an open letter to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, IATA chief executive Alexandre de Juniac urged the EU to support the concept – initially raised by Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis: A pan-European mutually recognised vaccination certificate would be an important step towards giving governments the confidence to safely open their borders, and passengers the confidence to fly without the barrier of quarantineHundreds of people who took part in the US Capitol riots may be added to the country\u0027s \u0027no fly\u0027 list, banning them from travelling on all airlines. The lists are shared between all carriers, with noted persons prevented from booking or boarding a flight. Throughout the pandemic, those who refuse to wear masks on board commercial flights have also been black-listed. Meanwhile, wider security measures have also been implemented across the US ahead of today\u0027s inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.According to the Transportation Security Administration, higher security measures include widespread air marshals on flights, and an increased police presence at all major airports in the Washington DC area – as well as bomb-detecting dogs and random screening at all three major airports.The Tokyo Olympics look unlikely to go ahead as the pandemic continues to paralyse large parts of the world, a senior official from the London 2012 Games has said.Keith Mills, who was deputy chairman of the London 2012 organising committee, said Tokyo officials should be making plans to cancel.Japanese and International Olympic Committee officials remain adamant the 2020 Games, already postponed for a year, will go ahead in July and August despite the ongoing health crisis.Personally, sitting here, looking at the pandemic around the world, in South America, North America, Africa and Europe, it looks unlikely, Mills told the BBC. If I were sitting in the shoes or the organisers, I would be making plans for a cancellation and I\u0027m sure they do, but I think they will leave it absolutely the last minute in case the situation improves dramatically. But it is a tough call.Wendy Wu, founder of Asia holiday specialist Wendy Wu Tours, has given her unequivocal backing to vaccination passports, and believes those who haven’t been inoculated should face strict curbs on travel.   If we are able to build a common standard, and all countries follow the same standard, then it should enable the holders to bypass testing and quarantine within the rules and guidance.When asked whether those who haven’t been vaccinated should be prevented from international travel, she said: “Yes, they should. However, in the event this cannot happen they should go through very thorough testing, and a strict two-week quarantine, to ensure they do not carry and spread the virus.”The news that the Government is mulling over introducing an Australian-style hotel quarantine system has sent shockwaves through the hospitality industry. However, for some hotels it might not be such a stretch. In fact, a number are already operating as luxury isolation properties, albeit on a smaller, more informal scale.One such example is five-star Flemings Mayfair, which rather than shutting down in the face of increased restrictions, has been welcoming a steady stream of isolating business and essential travellers over the past few months – for the princely sum of £515 per night (at least). Its quarantine service has already been used by an isolating Premier League footballer.The swish, second-oldest hotel in London, which sits in the heart of Mayfair surrounded by car showrooms, sushi restaurants and jewellery shops, has become a port in the storm for those who need to isolate for work purposes, or are doing so voluntarily to protect their families from Covid exposure. Emma Beaumont takes a look inside...Vaccine ‘passports’ would risk spreading coronavirus, the Government warned on Tuesday – despite the European Commission tentatively backing the idea. EU leaders will have their first discussions on the vaccination certificates at a video summit on Thursday. The Department of Health confirmed that vaccine passports were not being considered in Britain because it is not yet known whether the vaccines stop people from carrying the virus. That could mean British tourists missing out on EU holidays because they will not have the vaccination certificates, which the commission said could be used in the EU “and beyond”.  It is unlikely that Britain would accept the certificates from EU citizens hoping to travel to the UK.Brussels said that using the vaccination certificates to allow greater travel and tourism in the EU was “premature” at this stage but left the door open for the plans to be picked up in the future. James Crisp has the latest.Arriving travellers without negative Covid-19 tests are being fined and waved through border controls into the UK, despite Britons in a similar situation abroad being turned away.Some 30 air passengers have so far been fined £500 each after arriving in the UK without the correct certificate showing a negative PCR, lateral flow or LAMP test result from within 72 hours of departure.The Home Office confirmed that they had been allowed on their way – meaning dozens of people who possibly have Covid have been let into the UK since rules requiring pre-departure tests were introduced at 4am on Monday. By contrast, Britons who arrived in Spain and Italy without the proper documentation or PCR tests were sent back on their planes in a series of incidents over the festive period.Read the full story.Here\u0027s a quick recap of Tuesday\u0027s travel news: EU insists virus shots will remain voluntary Biden to block Trump\u0027s plan to lift Covid-19 UK travel restrictionsEasyJet sees 250 per cent rise in summer bookingsMore tour operators give backing to vaccine passportsSeychelles to open to all vaccinated travellersNow, on with today\u0027s headlines.Watch: Lady Gaga sings US National Anthem at Joe Biden\u0026#39s inaugurationEric Trump says he will \u0026#39never forget Buckingham Palace\u0026#39 as family seen in tears at farewell ceremonyPandemic intensifies malnutrition in Asia as UN warns almost two billion cannot afford healthy dietChina sanctions 28 people linked to Trump administration, including Mike PompeoCoronavirus latest news: Record daily deaths as Sir Patrick Vallance warns hospitals are like \u0026#39war zones\u0026#39Hunter Biden: the president\u0026#39s second son who was the target of Donald Trump\u0026#39s attacksInauguration Day 2021 news: Joe Biden says \u0026#39Democracy has prevailed\u0026#39 as he is sworn in as 46th US President – live updatesStorm Christoph: Prime Minister to chair Cobra meeting as two months of rain expected in two daysShared \u0026#39suffering\u0026#39 by fans of the worst Premier League teams creates \u0026#39strong social glue\u0026#39, study findsMinisters fear Storm Christoph could hit Covid vaccine rolloutComment: The EU\u0026#39s deal with China will enrich and embolden the largest human rights abuser in the worldPresident Joe Biden\u0026#39s: what will his first 100 days in office look like?London mayor took advantage of pandemic to introduce \u0026#39unlawful\u0026#39 road closures and cycle lanes, judge findsWhat will Donald Trump do now?

I was paying $1,300 for my LA studio. Now I have a treehouse for $400,” she tweeted, along with a picture of her new beautiful home.“Being a digital nomad is everything. I was able to successfully transition my graphic design business on road.”Among the advantages of living in Bali she listed “luxury lifestyle” and “queer friendly,” before promoting the sale of a $30 e-book, Our Bali Life Is Yours, that the couple wrote to help others move to the country. The Twitter thread sparked an immediate backlash, with irritated Indonesian social media users alleging Ms Gray was cheating the system by dodging taxes, and accusing her of exploiting her privilege to create gentrification and displaying an apparent lack of cultural awareness. While Bali’s laid-back vibe has always been popular with western travellers, it is situated in Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, where the LGBT community has for years been marginalised, targeted by police raids and sometimes violently attacked. The uproar caught the attention of the authorities and the immigration office summoned Ms Gray for questioning on Tuesday. In a statement it said she may have violated several immigration laws, including by spreading information that could disturb the public, such as suggesting that Bali was queer friendly and easily accessible to foreigners amid the Covid-19 pandemic.I Putu Surya Dharma, a spokesman for Bali\u0027s Law and Human Rights agency, told Reuters that she was currently being held at an immigration detention facility until a flight back to the US was available. Her lawyer said Ms Gray had a social cultural visa that was valid until January 24. Officials said they were also investigating whether Ms Gray had violated Indonesian law by carrying out business activities through the sale of her e-book.Ms Gray told reporters after immigration officials announced her deportation that “I am not guilty. I have not overstayed my visa. I am not making money in Indonesian rupiah. I put out a statement about LGBT and I am deported because I am LGBT.”Indonesia has temporarily restricted foreign arrivals since January 1 as it struggles to stop the spread of Covid-19. January is on track to be the deadliest month of the pandemic so far for the Southeast Asian nation, with 4,452 people dying from the virus in the first 19 days of the year. Elsewhere in Bali, foreigners caught not wearing compulsory face masks have been subject to an unusual punishment: push-ups.Video footage circulating on social media this week shows tourists in T-shirts and shorts being made to do the exercise in sweltering tropical heat as masked security officials stood over them.Most caught without a mask have agreed to pay a fine of 100,000 rupiah ($7). But those who said they did not have the cash were asked to do up to 50 push-ups if they were not wearing one at all, or just 15 if they were wearing it improperly, according to a security official.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"9 key moments joe bidens","story":"News key moments from Joe Bidens first speech that finally buried the Trump eraPresident Joe Biden has given his inaugural address as the th President of the United States - and broken with the Trump era by issuing a powerful appeal for unitymirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video pres-joe-biden-this-americas-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The th President of the US looked forward and warned “toughest and deadliest period” of the virus may lie ahead. Standing on the steps of the Capitol, attacked only two weeks ago by “domestic terrorists”, his key word was “unity”. “My whole soul is in this - bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. And I ask every American to join me in this cause,” he said. “We can make America once again a leading force for good in the world.”But plenty of his -minute inaugural address was also looking over his shoulder at Donald Trump - despite not speaking his predecessor’s name.In a final rebuke to the toxic billionaire, he vowed to “defend the truth and defeat the lies”. And he said: “We must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated - and even manufactured.” In a powerful message to “One Nation”, he declared: “We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.” Here are the  key moments from the Democrat’s address - which show a dramatic departure from four years under Trump. ‘Democracy has prevailed’ The new President issued a direct rebuke to Donald Trump’s baseless claims that the election was stolen from him. “Democracy is fragile, democracy is precious and at this hour my friends, democracy has prevailed,” he said. “This is America’s day. This is democracy’s day. A day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve. “Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. “Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause - the cause of democracy. “The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.”  ‘We must reject manufactured facts - and raging fire’ The President promised to “stop the shouting and lower the temperature - for without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only historic chaos.” In a clear burial of Trump’s style he said: “Politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. “Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war. “And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated - and even manufactured. “America has to be better than this, and I believe America is so much better than this.” He went on: “There is truth and there are lies. Lies toll for power and for profit. “Each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans and especially as leaders… to defend the truth and defeat the lies.”  He quoted Abraham Lincoln, St Augustine and the Bible When he was inaugurated four years ago Trump focused on his ‘America First’ nationalist rhetoric. Biden drew on his Catholic faith to quote St Augustine and the Bible - as well as Abraham Lincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation. Mimicking Lincoln, he said: “My whole soul is in this - bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. “And I ask every American to join me in this cause.” The President promised he will be “thinking not of power but possibilities, not of personal interest but the public good”. And quoting the Bible over Covid he said: “Weep, ye may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. The message of Christian goodness jars with scenes of Trump posing outside a church during protests against his rule. In another Biblical-style message, Biden said: “There’s no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days you will need a hand. There are other days when you’re called to lend a hand.” ‘Unity’ The President stretched the word ‘unity’ for all it had. “I will be a President for all Americans - all Americans,” he said. “And I promise you I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.” Putting the emphasis on the word ‘United’, he said: “We must meet this moment as the United States of America.”  He vowed a reset of foreign relations World leaders are looking forward to an end of the unpredictable, scattergun diplomacy of President Trump. Biden promised: “We can make America once again a leading force for good in the world.” He went on: “America has been tested and we’ve come out for it. “We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again - not to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s challenges. “And we’ll lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example. We’ll be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress and security.” He vowed justice for Black Lives Matter The President said the protests about race last year had been “a cry for racial justice  years in the making”. “The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer,” he declared. It’s a far cry from Trump’s repeated attacks on protesters and attempts to discredit them from his position of power. And he vowed justice for the environment After Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, the inaugural speech had little hard policy but a clear direction. “A cry for survival comes from planet itself,” he said. “A cry that canapost be any more desperate or any more clear. He vowed not to let the Capitol attack go unpunished Biden said he was on hallowed ground, where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitolaposs very foundation, we come together as one nation under God, inisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.apos And he said there was now a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.” He added: Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen, it will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever.

She said that Shyamala Gopalan, who moved to the US from India when she was , believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible.Kamala makes history by becoming the first woman and first woman of colour to become Vice President, as she and Joe Biden take over from Donald Trump and Mike Pence. When they won the election last year, a video of Kamala calling Joe to celebrate went viral - and she can be heard saying: We did it Joe.At , Kamala has already had an impressive career as the attorney general of Calornia and a district attorney in San Francisco. She was elected to the Senate in . She was born in Oakland, Calornia, in  to a Jamaican-born father and Indian-born mother. Her mother was an activist and researcher, Kamala said she was always in our hearts in her victory speech. She said: When she came here from India at the age of , maybe she didnapost quite imagine this moment. But she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible.  Kamala studied at Howard University before earning a place at the University of Calornia where she studied law. Her first political job was in the Alameda County District Attorneyaposs Office, and she stood in her first election in , when she became San Franciscoaposs district attorney. Seven years later she was elected Calorniaaposs attorney general in  - the first woman and black person to hold the job. In  she was elected to the Senate and she became known for questioning Trumpaposs administration officials.  She quickly became one of the partyaposs most prominent figures, and at the start of  she set her eyes on the White House. With the slogan aposKamala Harris For the Peopleapos, a reference to her courtroom work, she launched her own bid to become president. Her first rally attracted more than , people, but she quickly hit fundraising problems. Despite early promise, her campaign faded and she pulled out of the race two months before the first primary votes were cast.  She decided to back Biden, who described her as smart, tough and experienced. Announcing her as his running mate, he said: Sheaposs a proven fighter for the backbone of this country. Kamala knows how to govern. She knows how to make the hard calls. Sheaposs ready to do this job on day one. And Kamala isnapost the only person who will make history when she takes on the job, and her husband Doug Emhoff will become Americaaposs first ever Second Gentleman.  The -year-old will also be the first Jewish person in the countryaposs history to be married to a President or Vice President. The couple met on a blind date in , set up by PR consultant Chrisette Hudlin. Doug messaged her while he was sitting courtside at an LA Lakers game, and she replied Go Lakers despite supporting Golden State Warriors. But the message changed both of their lives, and they hit it off straight away and quickly fell in love. Speaking about their first chat, Doug previously explained that he couldnapost stop thinking about her so messaged her early the next day.  He said: I had an early meeting and as I was driving to work, I couldnapost get you off my mind. I kept saying to myself aposItaposs : am, itaposs way too early to call her. That would be ridiculous. Donapost be that guy. Donapost call her. Donapost do it. But his long and rambling message worked, and Harris still has it saved on her phone. She called him back that afternoon and they chatted for an hour. Their relationship moved fast, and a year later Doug got down on one knee when they were enjoying a night in together at home with a Thai takeaway.  But it didnapost exactly go to plan, and Harris was distracted. In her memoir, The Truths We Hold, she explains that she wasnapost really paying attention as she was searching for a pair of trousers. She explains that when she heard him saying he wanted to spend the rest of his le with her, she replied: Thataposs nice honey, should we have chicken or shrimp on the pad thai  She then turned around and noticed he was on one knee. She writes: I looked at him there, on one knee, and burst into tears.  Mind you, these were not graceful Hollywood tears streaming down a glistening cheek. No, Iaposm talking about snorting and grunting with mascara smudging my face. The couple married in August  at a small ceremony. Kamala became stepmother to Dougaposs children Ella and Cole, however they all agreed they didnapost like the term so they call her aposMomalaapos. Doug has been at Kamalaaposs side throughout the campaign, and has become close with Bidenaposs we, Jill, who is set to become the First Lady.  He is a successful entertainment lawyer, and is believed to make more than million a year. He joked about working from home with his we during an interview with Marie Claire, saying: “Imagine working from home with Kamala Harris, during a pandemic and all the other issues going on. She just works hard, and she’s relentless. It’s just incredible how much she does.

Ultimately, it’s a subjective description and only you can decidethe Tories are the “nasty party” or not. But here are  things that may give you pause for thought. The looming £ benefits cut We could not start anywhere  than the source of this row - the Universal Credit cut. The benefit was raised by £ a week in April  for one year to help people cope with the pandemic.But Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are now resisting calls to extend the boost.That means .million people will see a cut of around £ a month on April . Boris Johnson has said he’d rather see a focus on jobs and a growth in wages than focusing on welfare. But first of all, that’s misleading because % of people on UC are already in work but on bad wages. And secondly, critics say the £ boost wasn’t some ‘bonus’ - instead it finally brought UC to a level it should have been atnot for years of Tory cuts.  His comments on burqas… and ‘piccaninnies’… and ‘bumboys’… and Liverpool… and Hillary Clinton Boris Johnson has a long history of nasty name calling through his years as a conservative commentator and Tory MP. In August  he branded Muslim face veils “oppressive”, “weird and bullying” and said it was “absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes. Any female student who turned up to school looking like a bank robber should be asked to remove their face covering, he added. He refused to apologise and was cleared of breaching the Conservative Party code of conduct. He branded black people ‘piccaninnies’ with ‘watermelon smiles’ in .  In a column about Peter Mandelsonaposs resignation, Johnson said the announcement would lead to the blubbing of “tank-topped bumboys in the Ministry of Sound nightclub. Then-Tory leader Michael Howard forced him to visit Liverpool to apologise in  after he blamed fans for Hillsborough - and accused citizens of “wallowing in victim status”. Oh, and he also compared Hillary Clinton to a “sadistic” mental health nurse in a  column. We could go on.His attacks on ParliamentRemember Brexit Back in autumn  there were angry and emotional scenes in the House of Commons, when Mr Johnson and his top allies accused Remainer MPs of betrayal and branded their bid to delay Brexit the Surrender Act. He prompted outrage by saying the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox - a Remain campaigner murdered by a far-right terrorist - was to get Brexit done. And there was more anger when Paula Sherrf begged him to moderate his language, including that of the Surrender Act, only for him to reply it was humbug. Then-Attorney General Geoffrey Cox fuelled the febrile atmosphere, booming: “This Parliament is a disgrace”.  He was accused of tolerating bullying claims Mr Johnson faces the accusation he is willing to quash allegations of bullying and harassmentit served him politically. In November the PM cleared Priti Patel of bullying staff at the Home Office and other departments - but he is now facing legal action over that decision. A y inquiry found Ms Patelaposs behaviour, including shouting and swearing at staff, amounted to bullying. But Mr Johnson overruled the civil servant in charge of the process - prompting them to resign. Now lawyers acting for the FDA senior civil servants’ union have issued a pre-action notice to Downing Street, accusing the prime minister of acting unlawfully by overruling the findings of his own independent adviser Sir Alex Allan. Ms Patel has always vehemently denied bullying. The benefit cut that’s hit a million children The Toriesapos two-child limit on benefits has hit almost a million children across the UK. Some , households had their benefits cut by the cruel policy in the three years since it launched in . Overall those households contain , children.And the number of Universal Credit claimants hit by the limit soared by % in the two weeks to April , due to an influx of claims in the coronavirus pandemic.The damning figures last summer came after years of pleas by MPs, charities and academics to axe the austerity-era cut.

That includes firefighters, shop workers, bus and rail staff, street cleaners, taxi drivers, factory workers, prison officers and everybody  without the option of working from home. We want schools to reopen as soon as it is safe, and vaccinated teachers are less likely to take sick leave or be forced to self-isolate. Now is the moment for the Government to tweak existing plans and get jabs into the arms of those who come into contact with other people and, in some occupations, endure heavier death tolls. Sort it out, Prime Minister. Get gone, Don Goodbye and good riddance to graceless Donald Trump, the worst President and biggest loser in the history of the US. Departing to jeers after provoking a failed coup, Trump will be judged harshly by history.

A poll of , adults found  per cent even feel the disasters will always haunt them throughout their lives. The most common causes of awkwardness were found to be nervousness , lack of confidenceand drinking too much . Falling over, fluffing a joke, mistiming a hug or kiss and having food stuck in their teeth also made the list along with spilling a drink and bumping into an ex. Others have been known to use an ex-partner’s name by accident, laugh at the wrong moment or sit in silence with nothing to say. But the research, commissioned by Extra Chewing Gum, found  per cent preferred to laugh off any embarrassing moments. And while three quarters felt it wasn’t funny at the time, they admitted they can look back and have a good laugh about it now. Sasha Storey, head of minty fresh breath at Extra Chewing Gum, said: “We know that everyone has had a tough year, whether that be a virtual dating disaster or tech faux pas. “We now know dating disasters have happened to almost half of the nation… is it even a real datewe don’t have an interesting story to tell afterwards ”  The study also found a fth of adults have left a date early because they felt so mortied over something that happened, while  per cent cancelled the next meeting. With face-to-face dating taking a backseat during the pandemic, more than a tenth of adults have experienced a humiliating moment on a virtual date. This includes a housemate interrupting , awkward silences , a frozen screenand talking for a long time while on mute . As a result, more than one in  plan to get their ‘dating mojo’ back in  after it was so out of sync due to the pandemic, with a quarter admitting they have ‘let themselves go’ over the last  months.  It also emerged that of those polled via OnePoll who are in a relationship, one in six have moved in together specically as a result of lockdown. For more than a third this has led to romance being lost, while  per cent have experienced an embarrassing moment in front of their partner since moving in. It has also opened up some home truths, including realising their other half isn’t tidy , they have smelly breath , they can’t cook , they snore , and that they don’t wear pyjamas . The research was carried out by Extra Chewing Gum as part of its mission to help the public get their ‘ding’ back and identy areas people need a little help in their dating endeavours.  Sasha added: “The past year has been dferent for dating, speeding up lots of relationships and moving first dates to virtual settings. “But all still allowing for awkward moments - spilling drinks swapped for screens freezing and outfit disasters being hidden by camera positioning. “We want to help couples get their ‘ding’ back in .” "},{"url":null,"title":"6 things uk businesses need","story":"Advertorial things UK businesses need to do now the Brexit transition period is overOur new relationship with Europe means dferent trading rules - heres what you need to do to keep your business movingmirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN AdvertorialBusinesses must now follow new rules after the end of the Brexit transition periodThe UK has agreed a deal with the EU, meaning there are new rules for doing business with Europe. UK businesses which have not already done so must adapt to these changes now to avoid disruption and keep their business moving.Here are the six boxes you need to tick to ensure that your company is trading in line with the new regulations.TRADING WITH THE EU You must now make customs declarations when exporting goods to the EU. You can make the declarations yourself, but most businesses use an intermediary like a courier, freight forwarder or customs agent. Make sure you have an EORI number starting with GB. If exporting, you’ll need to check that the EU business you’re exporting to is also ready. The Government has taken measures to allow traders time to adjust to new processes. It has introduced new border controls in three stages until  July , and agreed with the EU to temporarily simply Rules of Origin procedures for  months to the end of December , by implementing a  month waiver on supplier declarations. TRADING WITH NORTHERN IRELAND If you move goods into, out of, or through Northern Ireland, make sure you also check the latest Northern Ireland Protocol guidance. If you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the free-to-use Trader Support Service will guide you through the changes. TARIFFS For trade with countries outside the EU, check for any changes to tarfs. TRAVEL If you’re due to travel to the EU for work, you may need a visa or work permit.RECRUITMENT If you want to hire from outside the UK, including from the EU, you must be a Home Office licensed sponsor under the UK’s new points-based immigration system.

Sanjay Aggarwal, Spice Kitchen Founder and Chief Spice Officer at Spice Kitchen Sanjay Aggarwal says he took great care getting ready for the changes – and so far, things have been working well.  “We’ve taken all the advice on board,” says Sanjay, whose firm is based in Widnes, Cheshire. “Well before the end of the transition period, we looked into the changes we should be making, like getting our EORI number and registering for the Trader Support Service which will assist us in our all-important sales to Northern Ireland. “We’ve also sought out specialist consultants to help with the customs side of things so I’m feeling pretty confident we’ll make it work.“We’re happy with the admin side of things because we prepared everything has been straightforward. I know some businesses that havenapost made those changes are having to catch up quite quickly, but once it’s done the situation seems very manageable and we’re confident everything will carry on smoothly.“Growing the business in the EU and globally is key to Spice Kitchen’s success so getting the boxes ticked and preparing for  has been a huge priority for us.”Thea Paraskevaides, Beaumont Music Thea Paraskevaides runs instrument accessories firm Beaumont Music with her husband Tim Walker.

Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council said there was a signicant amount of vaccine to go around, according to a joint letter seen by the Daily . Meanwhile, the GMB union has called for school support workers to be made a priority for the vaccine as they are more likely to fall sick than teachers.It comes after other unions called for police, teachers and shop staff to be put at the front of the queue for the vaccine.The Dailyreports that nursery workers in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough have been offered jabs - and the two areas have secured vaccinations for childrenaposs services staff in secondary schools.  But the two Conservative-controlled authorities today said they have since claried to schools and early years settings... that at this stage, the eligibility for the vaccine will only include staff who provide personal care and support. The vaccine priority list has been decided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation- an independent expert advisory committee.The top four priority groups are now eligible to get their coronavirus vaccine in England, meaning people who work in health and social care, as well as everyone over the age of , care home residents and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable can now be contacted for an appointment.The top priority groups are the over-s, care home residents, and NHS and social care staff, and the Government said it will remain the priority to vaccinate them. But there have been reports that some people outside of these priority groups have been offered vaccines.In the joint statement, Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council said: Our top priority is to ensure the vaccine is offered to those who are most vulnerable. In line with JCVI national priorities, this includes residents of care homes, the over-s and those providing frontline health and social care. By offering to these groups, we are following the national guidelines and Cambridgeshire County Council, Peterborough City Council and the local NHS are working hard to ensure these groups receive their jabs and not a drop of vaccine is wasted. As part of this work, other groups on the national priority list levels three and four are beginning to be invited to come forward for vaccinations.  Today, we have claried to schools and early years settings across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough that at this stage, the eligibility for the vaccine will only include staff who provide personal care and support. But we have also started to collect data from schools and other priority groups to be ready should the national guidelines allow us to provide wider vaccination at a later stage to people in these settings. We will continue to prioritise people for vaccines following JCVI guidelines. Meanwhile, hospital bosses in Darlington have admitted that three people from outside the priority group were vaccinated after a message circulated on social media.

Thataposs the sort of thing we might anticipate. This virus has taken us by surprise time and time again, we just donapost know. Iaposd be very surprisedwe go in year on year with needing to do things more than that, but this coming winter I think we need to wait and see how far we get on with the current reduction in numbers that needs to occur.Have you been personally affected by coronavirus  Let us know in the comments below  Speaking about the current measures, Sir Patrick said face masks were important for preventing spread from those who were infected and were important in crowds and for indoor mixing. He added: Vaccines - which are going to be so important in the long run - vaccines are not going to get the numbers under control now. The things that are going to get the numbers under control now are hand hygiene, keeping distance, not socialising, staying at home, wearing masks in situations where you have to be out.  These are the things that are going to keep the numbers down now and the things we absolutely need to focus on because numbers are very high still. Downing Street said advice on masks was always kept under review.  The PMaposs spokesman said: Weaposve been clear that we want people to wear face masks when in indoor settings, such as supermarkets and on public transport.

It is also surrounded by a nature reserve offering stunning views, and has a golf course on the doorstep. The Grade II* building has been created in a Palladian style and is described as a true English retreat by the letting agent, with a grand driveway lit by Victorian street lamps leading to the front door. Located in the countryside of County Durham, the spectacular aposCastle Edenapos was built for a Conservative politician and local landowner in the s.What do you think of the property  Let us know in the comments below.One of its most interesting features is the dungeon, which is accessible via stone steps and sprawls out underneath the entire footprint of the castle. It also boasts an orangery,  bathrooms, a dining room, lounge, living room and kitchen, with numerous other features including fireplaces and bespoke murals. The sleeping quarters include five bedrooms on the first floor and six on the second - eight of which are doubles. The property is being sold for an estimated £m by the firm Nest Seekers International, based in plush Mayfair, London.Speaking about the dungeon, spokesperson Lindsay Harrison said: It could be a wine cellar, you could put a spa treatment room in there, a cinema room, a games room. You could have all of them because it so vast, there is massive potential.And talking about the property as a whole, she told The Sun : Compared to something down south it is absolutely a steal.About  years ago it was in a bad way and the owners who picked it up then refurbished it all and did extensive work on it. Now it looks like itaposs not been touched - theyaposve taken the whole style and brought it back to its traditional ways.The listing reads: The Georgian manor house which is steeped in history since the early s has been through extensive renovations throughout its prime. The attached courtyard buildings have since been converted into separate residences that complement the area. The opportunities for this area are endless.

Arthur Morgan has been told to replace the . metre high structure at Mill House in Raby Mere, Merseyside, as it breaches planning rules because it is too high. Last week several councillors slammed the hard boarded structure at Wirral Councilaposs planning committee with Cherry Povall calling the fence a “hideous eyesore” and said it was unsafe for drivers as it obscured their view of a blind bend. Mary Jordan described the fence as “overbearing” adding that it is not in keeping with the local area. But the council did grant Mr Morgan permission for a . metre high open rail fence. However Mr Morgan said the council had not understood the special conditions that had led him to put up the fence at property which he is renovating.He told the Liverpool Echo : “When the current owner acquired the property, it was in a state of dereliction, full of damp and was at risk of being lost as a community asset and required considerable investment to be restored and made habitable.“Planning permission had been received to extend the property but works had only been started. “Developing a plan to save the property, a temporary timber boundary fence was erected whilst other works commenced, with a view to constructing a permanent more decorative wall and railing fence and entrance gates, that would be more in keeping with the period property, when additional funds would be made available. “In taking on the project of restoration of the property and grounds, it was anticipated that there would be construction challenges and additional unforeseen costs, however it was never anticipated that there would so much local opposition and misunderstanding towards the project.”  But, he claimed, the council had not been supportive of the project which so far the owner has spent £, on renovating with a further £, of work needed for completion. Mr Morgan said the council have repeatedly been asked to attend site and view the challenges and proposed works, but other than visits by planning officers have refused to do so or ignored the invitations. He added: “A good percentage of the work to the house itself is now completed, with only works to the rear elevation needing to be completed. “However, works have been delayed to landscaping with additional considerable costs being incurred due to the unforeseen challenges of surface water flooding. On the subject of the fence, Mr Morgan said: “Despite repeated requests the highways department have not ed or answered any emails or phone messages.  “This despite the dangers the flooded road can present to drivers, with there being a considerable unseen drop behind the boundary fence. “The council have however issued an enforcement notice against the property demanding that the fence be reduced in height, without understanding or even listening to the problems being created by the flooding, requesting that a new fence be installed within a month without addressing the issues about foundation requirements which cannot be built while flooding continues to erode the embankment. “Environmental changes in the area, including loss of gardens to neighbouring developments and properties, has increased surface water run-off and the water level of the Mere, which floods onto the road and further erodes the foundations. “Water pressure from the Mere has been identied in a structural report commissioned by the property owner as being a cause for major concern which is undermining the road foundations, further impacting on Mill House. “The water flooding has also brought with it waterborne spores of ‘knotweed’ from the mere and road, which has caused a large outbreak of ‘knotweed’ to the grounds of Mill House, which as had to be treated to prevent further spreading of the invasive weed down the water course and to other properties.

As of .pm, the environment agency has issued  flood warnings and  flood alerts today in England - see full list below. There are  flood alerts and  flood warnings in Wales, and  flood alerts in Scotland. Weather warnings for heavy rain are in force across the country, and the unsettled conditions could also bring signicant flooding, high winds and snowfall as the storm engulfs the country through the middle of the week. Almost the whole of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are subject to yellow weather warnings for rain until midday on Thursday, with a more serious amber warning stretching from the East Midlands to the Lake District. The amber alert warns of the risk of flooding and deep floodwaters which could pose a risk to le, and there are further yellow warnings for snow and ice in Scotland. Storm Christoph has caused concern for people living in areas devastated by the floods at the end of , who say they are preparing for the worst to happen again. Speaking during Prime Ministeraposs Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson told MPs: Our sympathies also go out to those affected by the latest floods. I want to thank the Environment Agency and our emergency services for the work theyaposre doing to support those communities, and Iaposll be chairing a Cobra meeting later on to co-ordinate the national response. The army has been placed on standby to help with potential flooding as soon as today, according to the . A yellow warning for snow has been issued for North East England from midday on Wednesday until am on Thursday.  A yellow weather warning for snow and ice was also issued for Dumfries, Galloway, Lothian  Borders. Yellow warnings for rain have also been issued for large parts of the country including South West England, East Midlands, Wales, Yorkshire  Humber, North East England, London  South East England, West Midlands and the East Midlands.  Simon Partridge, a Met Office forecaster, explained: Itaposs not a traditional sort of storm, itaposs going to be windy but itaposs not based on the wind strength at all, itaposs really down to the disruption thataposs being caused by rain. There are already parts of Cumbria that have already seen over mm of rain since midnight on Tuesday and thereaposs a large number of places that have seen mm, and we are going to see further rain over the next  to  hours. Honister Pass in Cumbria saw mm of rain between midnight and pm on Tuesday, according to Environment Agency figures.  Mr Partridge said the storm meant that some areas could see double the average amount of monthly rainfall over a few days. He said: Those areas that have seen between mm and mm already, the warning is out until midday on Thursday, so an extremely long period, but by then we could see up to mm to possibly mm of rainfall. The Midlands for example, their average rainfall total for the whole month is mm, so they could easily get double that in the course of two, two and a half days. Floodwaters have already risen in parts of the country, with a motorist pictured stranded in Leicester, and workmen in York preparing flood defences on Tuesday morning near the cityaposs River Ouse.Tuesday also saw disruption to transport, with Network Rail reporting delays and some line closures in the North West in the evening. However, residents of Fishlake, South Yorkshire - which was cut off by the floodwaters just over a year ago, said they are much better prepared this time with many having sandbags dropped outside their properties on Tuesday. A major incident was declared in both Greater Manchester and South Yorkshire ahead of the expected heavy rainfall. North Yorkshire County Council said more than , sandbags were at the ready around the county.

Itaposs heartbreaking, she keeps looking up at the sky.”Did you know the Tipton Twins  Let us know in the comments belowKerry, , from Hagley in the West Midlands, says she now wants to appeal to the public to have a blood finger oximeter in their home. “My aunt and nan thought they were fine so they didnapost want to go to hospital at first,” she said. “My aunt Doris had never been admitted to hospital before. “Nan had a little cough and Doris had no cough at all but a high temperature. When she was tested she told them that her sister had a little cough and needed checking too.  “But what we didnapost know is that Dorisaposs oxygen levels were deteriorating, Kerry said. “These little oximeters you can buy are crucial because the elderly will feel they are fine but the truth is they could be dying. “We wished we knew about them sooner. “If Doris had gone into hospital a week before she might have had a chance. “Whataposs even sadder is that Aunt Doris was weeks away from being safe. “Two days after she passed, she had a vaccination letter. Itaposs just horrible.”  Kerry said when the twins discovered they had Covid they were “shocked” at first, as they had no idea how they caught it. “They hadnapost been out for months and followed all the rules,” she said. “They didnapost even spend time with their family on Christmas Day.” A family statement said: “Both were determined to live until , they had so much to live for...itaposs just so cruel that Covid has stopped Doris like this. “Our thoughts go out to all the families who have experienced a loss through Covid and we urge people to take this seriously.”  The twins shot to fame with a series of hilarious TV interviews and have , followers on social media. They caused a stir on This Morning when they told Phil Schofield they had forgotten to put on underwear. And they made Piers Morgan blush when they told of their love for him and Jason Statham. They also revealed the secret to a long le was “plenty of sex”.  Piers told viewers Wednesday morning how they were two of his “favourite guests” and a real “ray of sunshine”. “What a wonderful lady, who led a wonderful le and kept up that extraordinary personality and enthusiasm and zest for le right until the end,” he said of Doris. They brought such cheekiness, such laughter - they were a wonderful duo.  Inseparable Doris and Lilian, lived on the same street most of their lives until they moved next door to each other in warden controlled flats. Lilian is now being supported by her family and staying with her daughter Vivien. Her twin will be laid to rest with her husband Raymond of  years who was the “love of her le”. She lost him  years ago.  Doris and Raymond, who never had children, worked together in a factory for most of their lives. They used to spend their spare time riding around in a motorbike and sidecar."},{"url":null,"title":"touching moment best pals hold","story":"NewsTouching moment best pals hold hands during wait for vaccine after  years apartMarion Darbyshire, , and Winnie Shaw, , lost touch after working in a factory in Wigan, Greater Manchester decades ago - before fate brought them back togethermirrorShareCommentsByHelena VestyJonathan Coles:,  JAN NewsMarion Darbyshire, , and Winnie Shaw, , initially became pals while working as sewing apprentices in a mens trouser factory decades ago \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Speaking from the hospital where she is being treated for her injuries, Rukiye said she had brought her husband breakfast in bed in what was meant to be a pleasant surprise. However, when she woke him, he flew into a rage because he had not been allowed to lie in and started shouting at her, she claimed. She said: I prepared it all and then went to tell my husband he had breakfast in bed. He was angry and demanded to know why I woke him up, and told me not to bother him, so I started having breakfast with my daughter.  He came in still in a bad mood and told me he was going to orce me and gain custody of our daughter no matter what I did. She added: He then poured boiling water down my neck.

When I came to, I could hear my daughter screaming and then I felt him grab my hair and drag me into the bathroom. She said the sound of her daughter crying gave her extra strength.  When he took a phone call to his father, she seized the opportunity to run to a neighbour who gave her shelter and called the police, leading to her husband’s arrest. However she was horried when he was released on bail. His release provoked public fury in Turkey, resulting in him being rearrested and remanded in custody. Rukiye said: I couldnapost believe it, as long as he is free me and my daughter are in danger. She said he pointed out how men locally often walked free after attacking women, including a man in her neighbourhood who she said had just recently escaped punishment.

We will ensure that services remain continuous and that all families are supported during this year and in the future.“Last time round lockdown came upon us suddenly, this time we’ve had the opportunity to learn and reflect on what did or didn’t work in the past and what we can take to the future, and the families are always very much part of this journey.”Louise Andrew, chief executive of Charlie House, added: #The latest announcement will make the start of  even more tough and challenging for everyone, but Charlie House is committed to making le better for babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions, their parents, brothers, sisters and all who love them.“From March  we changed our entire service model almost overnight from physical to virtual and went on to deliver  live and on-demand virtual activities,  postal activities,  support sessions and  pre- and post-bereavement sessions. We also sent , gted items to families to support them during shielding and isolation.“As of the start of the year we have assured the families we support that this will not only continue, but that we will also be expanding and adapting our current service offering to ensure local families receive what they need, when they need it.“The feedback from families on how vital this support was during last year was heart-warming and overwhelming, and as a team we are so happy that our adapted services have and will continue to give comfort and care to families in the north-east.”To ensure families don#t lose out on the same interactions, Charlie House altered and moved many of its support services online.From hosting Christmas and Halloween parties for youngsters to online arts and crafts videos, magician performances, sibling support sessions, virtual massage workshops, guided relaxation and more, assistance has continued to be a huge part of the charity#s work despite the change in circumstances.The lockdown has a profound impact on many, however, families with vulnerable children have also been particularly affected # especially as outside time may be limited for many during the cold weather.Leigh said: #Many of the families we support have been shielding since the first days of lockdown and, following the latest government announcement, have more days of isolation ahead of them.“When shielding restrictions were lted in the warmer months of  many families could venture out into their own gardens or go for short walks, but the cold winter temperatures we are currently experiencing just don’t allow that due to the complex nature of their child children’s medical condition.#Couple that with ice and snow underfoot for parents carers trying to manoeuvre wheelchairs, walking frames, etc, something which should be an enjoyable and accessible outdoor activity becomes an impossibility, leading to lots of time spent indoors and isolated.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities. RYA Scotland will continue to host online sessions for clubs and training centres and deliver its regular podcast #Off the Water# to keep the boating community informed.PIC:Owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in. _aTarbertHarbour"},{"url":null,"title":"council can help in tough times","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The Exchequer Roll of  reads: ldquoTo Brother John Cor,  bolls of malt, wherewith to make aqua vitae for the King. Eight bolls of malt would be enough to make approximately  bottles of whisky, so production was clearly continuing apace at Lindores Abbey.Today, a mere  years after the Kingrsquos order, whisky is once again flowing at its spiritual home. Lindores Abbey Distillery, situated outside Newburgh, Fe, opened in  following years of campaigning and fundraising work by the Abbeyrsquos custodians, Drew and Helen McKenzie Smith. The distillery is a glass-fronted temple to whisky, with soaring copper stills and complicated distilling machinery buzzing away while overlooking the beautul ruins of Lindores Abbey, where the story of whisky began.It has been a tantalising wait for the whisky to come of age since the first casks were filled in . On  December this year the spirit finally reached its rd birthday and the distillery is turning its thoughts to bottling.A limited edition release is a must-have for any whisky lover, but the opportunity to procure a bottle of the first ever release from the spiritual home of Scotch whisky is the stuff that whiskyphile dreams are made of. Only , bottles of the first release from Lindores Abbey Distillery will be filled, and they will be available exclusively to members of the  Society.The society aims to bring whisky lovers together and welcome them from across the globe to join us on the Lindores journey.

Some initial expressions of interest have been made and all options will be explored.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOThaw cuts water suppliesThe New Year thaw brought water shortages to much of Kintyre and the islands.Strathclyde Regional Council water workers, Argyll and Bute District Council housing maintenance teams, local plumbers and even the police were swamped with calls as pipes burst and water supplies were cut off.Many homes served by Aucha Lochy water treatment works near Campbeltown were cut off on New Year’s Day as the water pressure dropped due to burst pipes.The treatment plant was hit by a shutdown which has been blamed on a computer problem.As more burst pipes thawed out and started leaking, demand rose beyond the level which could be met by the treatment plant and its depleted storage tanks.As the amount of water available fell, so did the water pressure and homes on higher ground lost their supplies.Many parts of Southend were without water for  hours because there was not enough pressure in the pipes from Aucha Lochy to feed the pumping station at Auchencorvie.A water department spokesman said the high demand for water had mainly been caused by the amount wasted by burst pipes.FIFTY YEARS AGOLocal fan’s bus cancelled unexpectedly on eve of disaster matchThe Ne’erday clash between Glasgow soccer rivals Rangers and Celtic is normally attended by a bus-load of Campbeltown Rangers supporters.This year, however – for the first time since the local Rangers Supporters Association was founded in  – no bus travelled to the game.The secretary of the association, Mr Peter McKinley,  John Street, Campbeltown, explained that only  supporters showed any interest in the game – and the minimum number required to make the trip financially possible is .The bus was cancelled on the evening before the match.Mr McKinley told the Courier that he was relieved that the trip had not been possible.The exit at which  people were killed and hundreds injured at Ibrox Park on Saturday was the one always used by the Campbeltown contingent of supporters, he said.Mr McKinley is organising a dance and raffle in aid of the Ibrox disaster fund. Local beat group, the Sloe-Gin, will play at the dance without charge on Friday, January .Mr McKinley hopes to have the raffle on the way by the beginning of next week.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGONew Year holiday attractionsThe entertainments arranged in town for the New Year holidays present attractions of an ample and ied description.Out of doors football holds the field, a series of interesting games have been arranged for both for New Year#s Day and the following Monday.The evenings can be pleasantly filled by a series of entertainments of great promise, while an exceptionally large exhibition of poultry, pigeons, cage birds and rabbits has been organised by the Campbeltown Ornithological Society.The local Picture House management have made very complete arrangements for the crowds who are sure to include in the holiday rounds a visit to ‘the pictures’.During Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, continuous shows will be given from  o#clock in the afternoon, doors opening at ..The principal picture for Saturday is entitled ‘In the Hollow of Her Hand’ and it will be supplemented by a number of other interesting films both topical and humorous.A change of picture will be made on Monday and again on Tuesday when the principal films will be ‘The Judgement of the Desert’ and ‘The Merry-Go-Round’ respectively.The latter will be continued on Wednesday, and will be followed on Thursday, Friday and Saturday with a striking film entitled ‘The Snares of Paris’.This ied programme will be welcomed by patrons and should result in sustained interest in shows at the Picture House during the holiday period.On New Year’s night, a concert will be given in the Victoria Hall under the auspices of the local branch of the Comrades of the Great War.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

First Minister Alex Salmond, speaking in an exclusive interview with the Campbeltown Courier, said thathe and his government fail to save the Skykon factory, it won’t be for want of trying.Negotiations are taking place behind the scenes and he has met with potential buyers.The Courier asked the first minister the question that everyone in Kintyre would ask him, especially the -plus workforce left in the lurch at the wind turbine tower manufacturer at Machrihanish after the collapse of its Danish owners: ‘Can you save the factory ’Mr Salmond said: ‘Nobody can give an absolute promise. At this stage, these are dficult negotiations but I am deeply committed to this plant and I am going to strain every sinew to save these jobs, not for the first time but for a second time. I am hopeful that it can be done.’He added: ‘I have been personally in touch with potential buyers of the Machrihanish factory. I know the area and I think it is a great plant with a great future and a fine workforce and these are great assets for a potential buyer.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOCall for media campaign to launch ferryThe vice-chairman of the new Argyll and Bute Council planning, development and tourism committee is calling for a major public relations drive in Ireland to support the launch of the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle.Councillor David Webster said the service should be marketed as a new ‘gateway to Scotland’ in Irish newspapers, and on television and radio.He told the Courier that he believed the creation of the new council offered a ‘never to be repeated’ opportunity to put Argyll and Bute back on the tourism map.Mr Webster called for the creation of four local marketing groups, including one for Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay, to bring together councillors and trade representatives.Mr Webster also wants more done to persuade television companies and film makers to use locations in Argyll and Bute, more done to attract business conferences to the area and better facilities for sailing.He is also suggesting persuading ship operators to offer week-long cruises in Argyll and Bute similar to ones run in Norway.Mr Webster said: ‘Argyll and Bute is on the threshold of a boom in tourism and economic development, but onlythe council takes and maintains a lead in promotion, publicity and development, albeit in co-operation with Argyll and the Islands Enterprise and the new area tourist board.’FIFTY YEARS AGOPiped TV charges to be raisedWeekly piped television charges are to be increased at the beginning of April from s d to s d. Redfusion Ltd announced this week in a letter to Campbeltown Town Council about the service in the town.Mr CM Payne, general manger of Redfusion in Scotland, states that the increase is made necessary by the #uneconomic nature# of the operation to #duplicate# the network to allow for provision of BBC, BBC and STV colour television on the relay.Mr Payne writes that the Redfusion board of directors accepted his recommendation to proceed with the necessary engineering works.Of the increased charges to subscribers, Mr Payne writes: #We are naturally concerned in having to take this step, but as I mentioned above, the service is presently uneconomic, and in order to bring the network up to a standard capable of distributing at least thee colour programmes on -lines standard as well as the -lines standard transmissions, we shall require to spend a large sum of money.’ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesMr Duncan Macdougall Snr has given up the local agency for Singer’s Sewing Machines, which he has held for  years, and is being succeeded by his son Mr D Macdougall Jnr.Visitors of Campbeltown Poultry Show had a tangible reminder that #oor birds# have much more than local fame by seeing on view the Larkhall Jubilee Silver Cup, a handsome trophy, valued at  guineas, which was won by Kilkerran greys at Larkhall’s great jubilee event.The local Ne’erday ‘Marathon’ Jock v Geeke came off in the Showfield at half-time during the match between Drumlemble and Hearts.

I was brought up in Princes Street and it was the first time I had been out the Wee Toon. I was only  or  so it was strange to me.I loved the folks on the island who made us so welcome.

I hope the people of Jura see this.Leslie McArthur, Carluke, South Lanarkshire.I have contacted our roads department about the icy and, at times, ungritted pavements in my council ward.Many of my justiably concerned constituents have been in regular contact with me on this matter.With all that is going on, whether it#s the latest lockdown or a decreasing local authority budget, our hard-working roads workers are thinly stretched and do not have an easy task. However, when it comes to our pavements and roads, safety must always come first.Our pavements must be safe to walk on all year round.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands.The Scottish Government spin machine’s use of phrases last week like #encouraging progress# about the works at the Rest and Be Thankful cannot disguise its failure to make any real progress towards a solution.At an online briefing session last month, I questioned Transport Minister Michael Matheson on why it says it could take at least five years before it even starts work on a proper solution.He waffled on about planning permission, environmental impact assessments and compensating landowners. This is ridiculous. I’ve attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will delivers results, not spends all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people’s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal.The new year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic.

His cousin, Ian Crooks, is currently a serving minister in Canada with the Presbyterian Church of America.The family has had a long association with the WEC missionary organisation Rodger#s aunt, Martha Crooks, serving in Pakistan, and his cousins, Philip and Rhoda Crooks, in Senegal and in the UK.Rodger’s brother, Stephen, served as a medical doctor in Nazareth Hospital with the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society in the s, including during the Gulf War. Continuing this tradition and following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, Rodger’s son, Martyn, is the Children’s Pastor in Westside Church, Portland.Rodger said: #I suppose you could say that ministry is in my blood and I am grateful that serving God has been important in my family for several generations.#It is a great heritage and one of which I am proud, but it is Jesus’s blood and not mine that is important. Without his sacricial death, there would not be any good news of forgiveness and peace with God and I would not have a ministry at all.#As I said in my sermon on Sunday, God did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all. My primary role as a minister continues to be making the truth of the Gospel known and doing my best to impress upon people the importance of responding to it.#He added: ‘It has been a tremendous privilege to be called by God to be a minister of his Word and to have been enabled by him to continue in this role for all these years. Preaching and teaching the Bible is my passion, and the Bible is a book that is new and exciting every time it is opened and read. I hope to be able to continue sharing its truths for years to come, whether still in full-time ministry or not.’A video of the anniversary service and presentation is available on YouTube and can be accessed through the Campbeltown Free Church website at www.campbeltownfreechurch or on the church#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"announcements january 15 2021","story":"ProductionUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

elite football being given an exemption to continue amid the pandemic.ldquoNonetheless, the continuation of football at all levels has weighed increasingly heavy on me as president, my colleagues on the board and the joint response group as we have watched the new strain of the virus spread rapidly.ldquoWhile national sport has been afforded the privilege of elite sporting exemption, the risk of mass transportation of untested, largely part-time players is something that cannot be sustained as the cases continue to rise and available hospital beds become increasingly scarce.ldquoAfter discussions with the SPFL, the Premiership and Championship will continue on the proviso that both adhere to the existing testing regime.ldquoThe vast majority of teams in those isions are full-time professional clubs and so the risk of transmission remains manageably low.ldquoThe cost implications to lower-ision clubs was one factor but so too the realisation that many ndash with some notable exceptions ndash consist of part-time players who are either prevented from working due to the virus or have to work.ldquoIn either case, the risk is currently too great amid the developing nationwide

new study had shown that up to  houses could be occupied before any work was needed to improve the major access routes.Concern about the impact of the new town, which will be accessed off the Bankton interchange on the A, has been raised repeatedly by concerned members of the local community as the project progresses.But at a virtual meeting of the councilrsquos planning committee this week, the change to the condition was approved, after elected members ruled that the need to see houses on the ground at the settlement took priority.Despite some misgivings about the study, which insisted the traffic created by the first  homes being occupied would have a minimal impact on current movement, councillors backed the move.Councillor Kenny McLeod told the committee: ldquoNow is the time to get the foot down on this [project] and get it moving.The first residents of Blindwells, which will eventually see an initial population of ,, are expected to move in this September.East Lothian planners initially approved the building of the first phase of houses with a condition which required upgrades to the Bankton interchange, including traffic control signals at the roundabouts and additional upgrades to the slip roads.However, the amendment will now allow  homes to be occupied before any of the upgrade work is carried out.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, told the planning committee that Blindwells was ldquoone of the most important developments in our local plan.He said: ldquoIt is important this site moves forward, it has been so long in the waiting.ldquoIt is also important not to impose conditions on applicants that are onerous and can prevent it going forward.Some elected members voiced disappointment that no representative of Hargreaves took part in the

make a lsquomaterialrsquo dference.He said: ldquoI am not an expert in traffic modelling but I do believe there will be queuing problems on the A as this development expands.The change to conditions

Itrsquos a wonderful, heartfelt tale, well-written and engaging.We all have stories to tell and I hope that Finlayrsquos story may encourage others to find ways to tell theirs too.Enough from me here is his story:This story should be read from Part  to Part , as printed.A WHILE ago, I had just walked into the school playground when my class teacher came out and gave me a package, saying it had been delivered to the school office for me.This had never happened to me before, it has never happened to me since.I was being picked up by my mum we were both intrigued by what this package might hold but we decided to wait until we got home to open it. There was a brown hat inside. It was stitched with buttons and coins, some had been there a while, some only a few months.I was relieved to see the hat, I still have it now, though it is far too small for me.THERE was a woman who lived in Pitlochry, she was a teaching assistant in a primary school there she also volunteered to help clear the paths around Pitlochry.I have never met this woman, I have no idea what she looks like, I donrsquot even recall what her name is, but Irsquom incredibly grateful to her.One day, she was cleaning a path with autumn leaves next to the townrsquos theatre.She moved along there, smelling the autumn air, crunching the path, clearing the golden brown leaves, when she saw something that stood out.It was dark brown with lots of dferent colours on it. She picked it up it was a hat.She could have left it, kept it, taken it to a lost property, any of those things would have been reasonable to do, but she didnrsquot.That night, she rang up two schools with the same name ndash one was in England, one was in Scotland ndash looking for the person whose name was on the label.The first school had never heard the name. She put the receiver down and sighed.She tried the other one and finally, after having to be interrogated on why she was asking about the pupil, they said they would pass on the packageshe mailed it there.She got out one of her own stamps and wrapped up the hat.The label inside said: Finlay McIlwraith, Law Primary School.WE WERE at the cottage. It was behind a row of trees, partly ravaged by autumn, dry mud underneath.We walked through the door, and it was so cosy inside, a large communal area with a wood burning stove in the centre, perfect for toasting marshmallows at night when our friends arrived, and cabin-like bedrooms to the side.At the end, a freezing conservatory with a telescope. I suppose that was allowed. It is called the Observatory after all.We had a leisurely first day, eating and playing board games, but now it was time for a blustery autumn walk.I wrapped up with my coat, hat, scarf and gloves and then we were off.It was a windy, but still lovely golden late afternoon, sun lighting the paths we walked.We went past the theatre we were later going to see a play in, and then crossed the glittery river and we talked.It was a wonderful day full of bird songs and blowing leaves we kept walking, my hair blowing in the wind.MY MUM got off the train with her fellow commuters and started heading homewards, but before she went there she decided to have a quick look in her favourite haunts: charity shops.In there she saw a lovely wee childrenrsquos hat with buttons covering some of it she decided this would be a nice gt for her son, so she bought it, chatting with the volunteer and took it home.She added some more buttons and coins and, when it was suitably covered, presented it to me. I wore it everywhere for the next few weeks.It was nearly time for us to go on holiday: we were going to Pitlochry and I was away to pack my hat but mum stopped me just as I was about to.ldquoHang on a minute, I need to put a label on that before we go.ldquoOh mum, you donrsquot need that, itrsquoll look silly.ldquoNo, Irsquom putting a label on it what would happenyou lose it "},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-january-12-15-1996-1971-1921","story":" years agoTHERE was a dramatic start to the year off the countyrsquos coast, reported the East Lothian Courier on January , .Three lives were saved off the coast of East Lothian on Saturday, as gale force winds ripped across the water.Two brothers from Dunbar battled against the currents to pull a woman from the sea at the townrsquos harbour, and two other brothers, from Edinburgh, were washed unharmed on to the shore at Canty Bay, near North Berwick, after a surfing trip ran into trouble.RNLI leboats from North Berwick and Dunbar had raced to search for the young surfers in gale force eight conditions said to be among the worst for many years.At Dunbar harbour, Scott Davies, who was a leboatman for nearly  years, helped drag the drowning woman ashore, with the help of his brother, Robert, who is currently serving with the RNLI.He said the rescue was ldquoone of the most dficult he had ever carried out. years agoA COUNTY man who died in the Ibrox disaster was given a military funeral and three-volley salute at his graveside, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier on January , .More than , people attended the funeral of L Cpl John McGovern, a victim of the Ibrox disaster, when he was buried with military honours at Tranent on Friday.L Cpl McGovern was one of the  who died when the crush barriers gave way as the crowd was leaving the grounds.As the flag-draped coffin was carried into the Old Parish Church by pallbearers from  Engineer Regiment ndash in which he served for six years ndash men of Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, formed a Guard of Honour.The tiny church was filled to capacity as the Rev.

Similarly, our ied crop of quality vegetables head for the big supermarkets. Major supplier East Lothian Produce therefore does not expect business to be affected, except in some seasonal export of Brussels sprouts to the Netherlands.

For reasons that escape our farmers, the Brexit deal allows unfettered access of EU potatoes into the UK but restricts trade in the opposite direction. Unless resolved, our top-class producers will be forced to switch to other crops, at a loss to all concerned.On your weekly shop, use outlets like the Community Carrot in Dunbar, supplied by the local farmers who steward our countryside.

In these dficult times, we should be doing all we can to support small businesses, not creating obstacles.Mr Mulholland, who took over the shop two and a half years ago, said: ldquoSpending pound, on the shutter for a small business during the pandemic was a big decision andI have to take it down I will have to reconsider my business in Prestonpans and look for another location, which would be a shame.The appeal is with the Scottish Reporter, who is due to visit the shop site."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-grammar-school-headteacher-colin-gerrie-leaving-job-dubai","story":"In a letter to parents, he announced that it was with \"very mixed emotions\" that he would be leaving his post at the school at the end of session  in June.He said: \"I have recently been informed that I am the preferred candidate for the post of head of secondary at Greenfield International School in Dubai.\"Whilst I will be sad to leave Musselburgh Grammar School and will miss our fantastic students and staff, I will do so knowing that the school will continue to go from strength to strength.\"He said that East Lothian Council would now have time to recruit a successor in the months ahead which would allow for \"a seamless transition\".Mr Gerrie took over as headteacher at Musselburgh Grammar in February .He said: \"The Grammar is firmly rooted in the local community.

The first is plasma B cells, which create antibodies to act against the virus. This type of cell is fairly short-lived, however, so without a second shot, rapid decline of these cells will occur, offering weaker protection.The second type of white blood cell created are T cells, which are tailored to identy a pathogen and kill it. Sometimes, these can linger in the body for decades, providing immunity from diseases that can last a letime.Importantly, the booster - or second - dose of the vaccine gives your body a higher frequency of these crucial virus-fighting T cells.Can I mix with family members or friends once theyrsquove had both doses Once someone has received both doses of the vaccine, they will have the full protection offered by the vaccine.However, there are a couple of reasons why it is not advisable to ditch current guidelines around social distancing and staying at home, even when both doses have been received.The first is that, though offering very high levels of protection, receiving a coronavirus vaccine does not offer  per cent protection against the virusyou expose yourself to others who may have it, therersquos still a chance yoursquoll catch it.If you have had the vaccination and catch coronavirus, your illness is likely to be far less severe thanyou had contracted the virus without it.Secondly, though scientists expect the vaccination to reduce the risk of people carrying and spreading coronavirus, the evidence is not clear-cut - meaning that, evenyou are vaccinated, you might still inadvertently spread the virus to others.You should continue to follow Government measures and guidelines around coronavirus until otherwise instructed."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-petrol-station-glitch-motorists-urged-check-bank-statements","story":"According to MoneySavingExpert, furious shoppers have issued complaints to the supermarket after payments were taken months after the purchase of fuel.Some are now worried they donrsquot have the cash in their accounts to cover payments.The financial-tips website quotes the supermarket as saying a ldquotechnical issue meant certain payments during October, November and December  at ldquoa small number of filling stations werenrsquot taken at the time ndash and in some cases have been charged months down the line.Anyone who purchased fuel, either at the pump or the kiosk, using either a debit or credit card between October and December last year could be affected.Tesco have apologised andsay the issue has since been fixed.MoneySavingExpert say the supermarket would not reveal how many people were affected, however, they had received more than a dozen complaints since mid-December.Tesco also wouldnrsquot reveal what stores have been impacted, however customers claim to have been impacted in Irvine, North Ayrshire and Lincoln, Lincolnshire ndash making them believe it is not confirmed to one area of the UK.The supermarket adds that it has contacted affected customers and told them when payment will be taken.

According to YouGov, were massively reliant on potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, peas and tomatoes - but with increased Covid restrictions meaning yet again more home cooking, a bit of iety at dinnertime can only be a good thing. And the more greenery involved, the better.Youll probably be aware of, or at least familiar, with this bunch, but how often do you actually pop them in your basket  Put these to the top of your shopping list now.... RomanescoOne of the most beautul vegetables around, Romanesco really ought to give standard broccoli more of a run for its money. Lime green and leafy, its fractalsare also, mathematically-speaking, stunning: theyre an example of nature perfectly reflecting the Fibonacci sequence. Excellent as a cauli substitute in caullower cheese, it will happily replace broccoli anytime youd usually eat it.. CeleriacWith its trailing roots and gnarly skin, celeriac can be a little alien-like and off-putting to look at or chop up, but once peeled and slowly braised with lots of chopped garlic and as much butter as you can handle, it is quite spectacular. Sweet, nutty and ideal in a wintry stew, wed also advise roasting it alongside carrots, parsnips and beetroot, to go with your Sunday roast.. KohlrabiIf you love your root veg, youll appreciate kohlrabi. Generally spotted in delicate purple or pale green, the German turnip cabbage tends to combine all the flavours of cabbage and broccoli, with the crunch and snap of water chestnut. Use it as the base for a grated salad , and you can also roast it, steam it and stir fry it.. FennelShave it raw into winter salads with orange slices and lots of olive oil, or remind yourself that quite a few ieties of veg rather enjoy being doused in cream and cheese. A fennel gratin, spiked with garlic, chilli and a snowy handful of Parmesan, will be fought over when served with roast chicken. Then chuck any fennel and chicken leftovers together to make a pie the next day.. KaletteKale can be a hard sell, especially when it comes to getting children to remotely appreciate its health benefits and slight bitterness. Kalette may fare better, what with it being so cute, frilly and purple-edged. Treat the same as its more grown-up sibling: fry in butter, stir through risotto, use to bulk out curries.. Shiitake mushroomsClosed cup, chestnut and Portobello are all very well, but the world of fungi is far wider and greater than that. Either experiment with a box of wild mixed mushrooms or go straight for the shiitake. Chewy and with bite, the East Asian mushrooms make for a substantial alternative to meat, and have a real umami hit when used dried too.. OkraOkra - also known as ladies fingers - is the seedpod from the abelmoschus esculentus plant, and originates from Africa. Suitable for low, slow cooking in stews, and also deep frying in a crunchy, spicy coating, it can take a real whack of seasoning.. SamphireIf youre lucky to live on the coast, you might be in a position to go forage these tangles of salty, juicy succulents. The fronds are crunchy, moreish and slightly reminiscent of asparagus. Ideal for pairing with seafood, like scallops, clams and sea bass fillets, dressing with lemon juice. You can even use it as a garnish in a gin and tonic."},{"url":null,"title":"mary-contini-spinach-fontina-risotto","story":"The best risotto I have tasted has been on Burano, one of the islands on the north east lagoons of Venice.The secret of a good risotto is the correct rice, well-flavoured stock and plenty of grated Parmigiano and butter.

But, there is a limit to Scotlandrsquos emotional resilience. Is now the time to bring up such a isive issue and push forward with a political dogma which could turn families, friends and communities against one another If we reflect back on the summer of , Scotland was riding on a high from hosting the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. There was a great sense of pride felt by all ndash a perfect backdrop to what was to come in the Autumn.That year I began my media career as a trainee sports reporter at those Games, but it also paved the way for a future covering politics, and it all started with the independence referendum that September.I was part of the team organising Scotlandrsquos biggest ever youth debate ndash which saw  school pupils descend on Glasgowrsquos SSE Hydro to put their questions to policy makers. In the lead up to the debate, I spent weeks interviewing  and -year-old school pupils who had recently been given the vote and were excited to exercise their newfound democratic right for the first time.What should have been a fantastic experience, witnessing the next generation engaged in the political process, instead flagged up deep isions within Scottish society at the time. One conversation that has stuck with me was an interview with a -year-old girl who was born in Scotland to English parents and told me she was immensely proud to be Scottish but had been bullied by classmates for her accent and told she didnrsquot belong here. This was unfortunately a common theme throughout my interviews.In the coming weeks we should all prepare ourselves for keyboard warriors and self-proclaimed experts from both sides of the fence which will litter our social media feeds, andanxiety levels are running high as a result of the pandemic, let me assure you they will be triggered further still.Although the full economic and employment impacts of Covid- are yet to emerge,the looming recession is similar to that experienced after the  financial crisis, the number of people of working age suffering poor mental health in the UK would rise by half a million, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.I was pleased to hear Dr Alistair Cook ndash the principal medical officer for mental health ndash address the nation during the First Ministerrsquos Covid update last week, detailing the support on offer for those who are struggling during the current uncertainty.The Scottish Government is under no illusion that the pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a severe impact on the nationrsquos mental health and in response launched their lsquoTransition and Recovery Plan for Mental Healthrsquo this past October, to outline how they will respond in the months and years ahead.Before the pandemic, public demand for mental health treatment and support was already outstripping supply. A recent freedom of information request made by the Scottish Liberal Democrats found that one in eight senior mental health roles in Scotland are vacant, and across the country  consultant psychiatrist roles have not been filled.The Scottish Government is aware of these statistics and have rightly made strong commitments to addressing mental health ndash including increasing investment to pound million for  additional mental health workers by - ndash butthey are serious about tackling this ticking time bomb, then indyref must be placed on the back burner until Scotland regains its footing.Even amongst independence supporters, there is recognition that such a landmark vote shouldnrsquot get in the way of other priorities which need addressing. That same Savanta ComRes poll which showed a majority in favour of independence also revealed that health and the economy were in the top three most important issues facing the country, with independence coming in at sixth.Will the Scottish Government prioritise political ambition over public health at a time where Scotlandrsquos emotional resilience is already under immense strain I am by no means arguing against another independence referendum further down the line, but this should be a discussion for when this great little country is no longer on its knees and facing a looming mental health pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"mighty-pens-write-book-herald","story":"Whether for fun, personal satisfaction or whether you want to become the newMuriel Spark, Alexander McCall Smith or Ian Rankin this contest is for you.There are many of us who would like to write a book ndash a novel, or even a short story.

Nobody, from the First Minister to the Scottish Football Association, escaped his wrath. Not even the breaking news that another team member had tested positive derailed his self-righteous fury. Theirs, he said, was an entirely legitimate and well-run exercise. The furore, he said, was ldquoall political.Maybe it was in some quarters, but for the general public ndash those who have never heard of Mo Salah or Harry Kane let alone Scott Brown ndash to see sportsmen heading for the sun at a time of national crisis was astonishing. It starkly reinforced the fact that footballers are an elite for whom the rules are stretched or revised wherever possible. Indeed, the sporting top tier appears to live in a bubble of its own, but not the Covid kind. Just like Novak Djokovic, complaining about having to quarantine in a Melbourne hotel room, these star performers believe they are invincible, that their status and acclaim protects them from criticism, challenge or, indeed, infection.: Vaccinate supermarket staffTo be fair, the scenes of Celtic on their day off by the Dubai poolside were not as shocking as those from the autumn, when the Scottish squad celebrated its Euro  play-off success. In jubilation, they danced a congo like six-year-olds at a party. Since then, viewers of the Premier League have weekly witnessed footage of high-profile players ndash and in Europe ndash cuddling and canoodling after every goal and victory. Despite dire levels of British infection, the idea of taking a firebreak pause this season was deemed unthinkable.Celticrsquos miscalculation was to jet off just at the point when everyone  had to hunker down. Their trip might not technically have broken any law, but nor did it uphold the spirit of the times. While they were enjoying sunshine on their backs, ordinary mortals were facing a grim endurance test, and hospitals filling with the sick and dying. As Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly urged, testing the limit of whatrsquos allowable is in nobodyrsquos interests. We should be trying to do as little as possible, not as much. Heading to Dubai certainly falls into the category of pushing the envelope, as does much of the sportrsquos behaviour in recent weeks.Lennonrsquos lack of remorse is not surprising. Across the board there is a sense of entitlement about the football world. It is treated so reverentially yoursquod be forgiven for assuming it was sacred. While other industries and activities are mothballed until the pandemic is under control, football has been designated a special case. Getting the game back on the pitch has been viewed as an urgent priority, asthe countryrsquos mental health depends upon it. The mere thought of a match makes everyone happy, or so we are told, although clearly that is nonsense. Where I live, Scotland could be playing in the World Cup final, yet few would be glued to their screens. Rugby is an entirely dferent matter, streets empty during the Calcutta Cup.So when did football become a barometer of national well-being  To a degree all sport is for the wider good, but nothing beats football for the privilege and leeway allowed, in the name of boosting morale. It seems to be universally accepted that without the chance to cheer on their side, fans would go bonkers with boredom and misery. While some see the vaccine as light at end of the tunnel, for a clubrsquos supporters, watching their side emerge from the tunnel is the stuff of miracles.I admit, it does feel like a semblance of normality to hear match commentaries on the radio on a Saturday afternoon. For the first half hour I even enjoyed the David and Goliath clash that was Marine v Spurs. Yet while top players are meant to be role models for young men in respect of Covid etiquette, many set a poor example. Spitting, neglecting to mask up, bouncing like popcorn in cramped changing rooms, holding parties, inviting young women into their hotel rooms... the list goes on. Despite all the advantages and privileges football has been accorded during lockdown, still the players ndash and managers ndash donrsquot get it. With notable exceptions such as Marcus Rashford, they are like royalty of old, heedless of what regular people are going through.: We can all enjoy Scotlands hillsBy comparison, how do small theatre companies or arts bodies feel ndash not to mention musicians, writers and artists ndash to see football clubs asking for government support  In one breath they beg for a handout, while with the next they bid millions for new players. Meanwhile, other players earning tens of thousands of pounds each week sit idle on the bench, like thoroughbreds confined to the stable.Despite the rise in the womenrsquos game, and a growing number of female fans, football remains a minority and mainly male interest. Almost as many folk attend church as games. Going to the cinema or theatre, listening to live country, blues or classical music or poetry readings, are minority interests too. All of these and countless other art forms and activities are as vital to our sanity as the sight of a penalty shootout.In Scotland, the so-called beautul game is a boring two-horse race: Rangers v Celtic . As Celtic might eventually learn, own goals come in many forms. Few, however, are more self-defeating than when the sporting elite loses touch with the real world.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions They do not necessarily represent the views of the Herald."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12238404.jpg?type=article-full","title":"israels-vaccination-policy-real-world-evidence-delaying-vaccine-booster-right-decision","story":"The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, is continuing to lobby for frontline workers to be offered the booster earlier than  weeks because while the ldquoshort-term efficacy of the first dose for preventing serious illness is  per cent, it is unclear when this starts to wane,Dr Thomas Williams, a clinical lecturer at Edinburgh University, said that he empathised with his clinical colleagues but said the Government had to be pragmatic in the face of surging cases and new iants of Covid-.He said: ldquoAt the end of the dayitrsquos a choice between slightly less protection for you or one of your patients dying then surely you would have to go for the protection of patients.The latest figures show that . million people in Israel have now received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccines, around % of the country and more than anywhere  in the world, although the government has faced criticism from human rights groups for failing to commit to protecting Palestinians.: Lockdown to remain in place in Scotland until at least mid-FebruaryFigures show , people were diagnosed with Covid after having one dose of the vaccine.

The fact that only . per cent of convictions for wildle crime resulted in custodial sentences would suggest that the vast majority of cases were relatively minor, but Mr Smith merely uses the statistic to create his own fiction.On raptor persecution, which we all feel is totally unacceptable, Mr Smith relates the disappearance of two hen harriers. It is totally unknown what happened to them, but that did not stop him implying that they were illegally killed just because there was a grouse moor in the vicinity. I assume Mr Smith has heard of the legal necessity for proof, or is that just an inconvenience  Couple that with his obvious lack of knowledge of grouse moors and how they are managed and we get a clear picture of prejudice. The RSPB kills predators on its reserves, so is Mr Smith suggesting that the RSPB also kills raptors  This clearly displays the paucity of his argument.However, his bias is displayed most clearly in his references to fox hunting. Could it possibly be that his \"undercover investigator\" was actually a member of the League Against Cruel Sports   The same organisation which was criticised by the legal system for producing falsied evidence  No one could possibly believe this investigator was even slightly unbiased and his quote clearly underlines that fact. Whether Mr Smith likes it or not, fox hunting continues towithin the law.This work of propaganda falls well below the standard one expects from a newspaper of the standing of The Herald.David Stubley, Prestwick.END PROHIBITION ON DRUGSSTRUAN Stevenson Letters, January  lists the effects of US Prohibition: bootleggers, speakeasies and increased crime. While his views on SNP policies and actions on alcohol abuse are fair comment, there has been no Prohibition.However, perhaps Mr Stevenson will next deal with the real Prohibition which applies throughout the UK and is not the policy specically of the Scottish Government ndash the prohibition on drugs which produces the equivalents of bootleggers and speakeasies, crime which makes le a misery for thousands and fills our prisons, and horrendous death statistics.The end of Prohibition did not mean the end of control of alcohol sale and use and the mitigation of its damaging effects, and there is no reason why the same should not be the case with drugs. On the other hand, prohibition and the \"war on drugs\" is the rejection of any real control.Ronald MacLean, Beauly.SLIDE-RULE ACCURACYYOUR picture of the installation of the railway bridge at Anniesland Crosswas witnessed by my now--year-old father. He tells me that its purpose was to allow the widening of the road into the four-lane thoroughfare we know today.The frames of the bridge were pre-installed in preparation for the main part of the project. On a Sunday, when there were no trains running out to the then-developing Bearsden and Milngavie, the old bridge was removed, the abutments widened, the east and west frames positioned and the rail bridge, ballast and track installed. Train services recommenced on Monday with no delays.It was even completed without computers, emails, computer-aided design or social media.

And donrsquot forget that Italy, France and Ireland also have the new iants and their Governments are,anything, imposing even stricter restrictions than the UK and Scottish Governments.I previously called for the whole tournament to be postponed to April, and now Irsquom thinking even later in the year. I accept thatrsquos not going to happen, not least because we donrsquot know when it will be safe to have crowds in again. It sticks in the craw, however, that once again we wonrsquot get a proper Six Nations because the rugby authorities and the broadcasters have joined together to say so.I completely understand the desperate need for the SRU and all the Unions to gain some income from any source they can, so the matches are going ahead to keep the broadcasters happy, but that will lose the SRU millions of pounds in match day income they canrsquot afford to lose.With three home internationals in this yearrsquos tournament, the SRU could have been looking at banking north of poundm at least from ticket income, which, donrsquot forget, was going to be heavily boosted by the Nevis membership scheme. The SRU had hoped to have a ballot of Nevis members completed by Friday, January , for any tickets that they would have been allowed to sellthe Scottish Government eased its coronavirus restrictions, but of course those restrictions have been tightened and extended and the likelihood is that it will take to the end of the full vaccination programme across the whole of Europe before it is safe to have crowds watching international rugby matches again.So all that ticket money is lost, and I just hope the broadcasting income is sufficient to keep the SRU and all the other Unions solvent. And given that they will be broadcasting a second-rate product ndash any international match behind closed doors is always going to be second-rate ndash will the broadcasters pay full whack or demand a rebate  I think we should be toldhellipOnce again a we repeat the debacle of last year, none of the unions bothered to ask their fans - you know, the people that pay their wages ndash what they would like to see. I am absolutely convinced that the majority of fans in all Six Nations would have said lsquopostponersquo rather than go ahead as planned, because they know that merely watching a match on telly is absolutely no substitute for the real thing.The point is that the fans are an integral part of the action within a stadium, particularly at Murrayfield where , spectators can make a helluva din that definitely affects the players. The crowd gets involved in the action in that unique bond between those on the pitch and those off it, and seeing a match on television just is not the same. To me the Six Nations is all about meeting old pals.First Minister Nicola Sturgeonrsquos announcements yesterday mean that we wonrsquot even be able to gather in pubs or club to watch the England and Wales matches, and as far as I can see, you will have to break the rules, maybe even the law, to gather in any size of a group to watch the first two matches and probably the rest of the tournament because I donrsquot see the current restrictions being lted to April, not least because the vaccination programme will not reach the younger majority of the populace until then.The First Minister said earlier this week that it will take until September to get everyone vaccinated, and personally I think she is being optimistic. Put it this way, I for one will not be going anywhere near a crowd of any kind until after I get my second jab, and even then Irsquoll still be taking every precaution because knowing my luck, Irsquoll be one of the  per cent or so for whom the vaccination wonrsquot work.Donrsquot get me wrong ndash I will watch all the matches on television, but only out of duty. I will also hope that all the players stick to their rigid safety-first routines and avoid catching this dreadful disease.

Mr Trump, a supporter of oil, gas and coal, had made a first priority of pulling out of global efforts to cut climate-damaging fossil fuel emissions.It will take  days for the US to officially be back in the accord.Mr Biden also is setting in motion an evaluation of another Trump move that cut boundaries and protections for some national monuments.Agencies will be directed to consider impact of climate change on disadvantaged communities and on future generations from any regulatory action that affected fossil fuel emissions, a new requirement.Immigration- Ending travel ban: Mr Biden is ending what is iously known as the \"travel ban\", one of the first acts of the Trump administration.In January , Trump banned foreign nationals from seven mostly Muslim countries from entry into the country. After a y court fight, a watered-down version of the rule was upheld by the Supreme Court in a - decision in .The new administration says it will improve the screening of visitors by strengthening information sharing with foreign governments and other measures.- Border wall: Mr Biden is immediately ending the national emergency that Mr Trump declared on the border in February  to ert billions of dollars from the Defense Department to wall construction.He also is halting construction to review contracts and how wall money might be redirected.Despite Mr Trumps repeated promises that Mexico would pay for the wall, US Customs and Border Protection says Americans have committed  billion dollars for more than  miles.- DACA: Mr Biden will order his Cabinet to work to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivalsprogramme, which has shielded hundreds of thousands of people who came to the country as young children from deportation since it was introduced in .:Donald Trump hails his the success of his administration as he says movement we started is only just beginningMr Trump ordered an end to DACA in , triggering a legal challenge that ended in June when the Supreme Court ruled that it should be kept in place- Deportations: Mr Biden is revoking one of Mr Trumps first executive orders, which declared that all of the roughly  million people in the country illegally are considered priorities for deportation.The Department of Homeland Security will conduct a review of enforcement priorities.

Susan Rice, who is tapped to run the White House Domestic Policy Council, says any decision on moratoriums would come from Homeland Security.- Census: Mr Biden is reversing a Trump plan to exclude people in the country illegally from being counted in the  Census. The once-a-decade census is used to determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets, as well as the distribution of . trillion dollars in federal spending each year.Mr Bidens team says the new administration will ensure the Census Bureau has time to complete an accurate count for each state and that the apportionment is \"fair and accurate\".Student debtThe Education Department will be asked to extend a pause on federal student loan payments through to at least September , continuing a moratorium that began early in the pandemic but was set to expire at the end of January.Borrowers, who owe a collective . trillion dollars, would not be required to make payments on their federal student loans, their loans would not accrue any interest, and all debt collection activity would halt through September.Congress paused student debt payments last March as part of a virus relief package, and the Trump administration extended it twice.Mr Bidens order does not include the type of mass debt cancellation that some Democrats asked him to orchestrate through executive action. He has said that action should come from Congress.Housing foreclosuresHousing foreclosures and evictions would be delayed until at least March  .Almost % of homeowners with mortgages are late on their payments, while % of renters are behind, according to a Census Bureau survey of households.The federal moratoriums would ensure that people could stay in their homes eventhey cannot afford their monthly bills.

At present, two Britten-Norman Islander aircraft, based at Kirkwall, fly the routes, carrying around , customers every year.During the new contract, the airline has said it fully expects to convert the aircraft to use low-carbon propulsion to replace the same type of conventional piston engine which has powered the services for over  years.Loganair is a key participant in several projects to bring low or zero-carbon technology to commercial air transport, and will be supporting flight trials of two separate programmes — hydrogen-powered and electrically-powered aircraft — at its base in the Orkney Islands in the first half of .It is the only UK regional airline invited to participate in the UK Government’s Jet Zero Council initiatives to de-carbonise future air travel.Loganair chief executive Jonathan Hinkles said: “We’re delighted and privileged to have been chosen to deliver Orkney’s essential inter-island air services for a further four years.“It’s a vital service for the prosperity of the North Isles, and our ability to retain this contract is entirely due to the experience and hard work of our dedicated team in Kirkwall.“The four-year contract award provides us with certainty on which to plan for the future — whether that be the transition to new low or zero-carbon technology or in the recruitment and training of staff in Orkney to work on the inter-isles operation.“The North Isles services are a key part of Loganair’s DNA, and, despite our expansion as an airline, we remain today as committed as ever to serving the communities of Orkney.”Although the world’s shortest scheduled flight — two minutes between Westray and Papa Westray — is one of the islands’ tourist attractions in its own right, Orkney’s inter-island service fulfils a year-round critical role in the delivery of education, healthcare, mail and other essential services to Orkney’s North Isles.The new contract, won following a competitive tender process, will run for four years from April , , securing the employment of ten pilots, engineers and ground staff dedicated to the services at Loganair’s Kirkwall base. Loganair has recruited and trained engineers locally to take over from retiring long-serving members of its team and is committed to continuing this policy of local investment in Orkney wherever it possibly can.Responding to the news, the chairman of OIC’s development and infrastructure committee, Councillor Graham Sinclair, said: “Communities in our North Isles have been served by Loganair for more than half a century and now, following a competitive tendering process, the airline has been awarded the four-year contract once again.“In these ever-challenging times, with uncertainty around every corner, I am sure the continuity of service will be welcomed by residents.“I also welcome Loganair’s future plans which include conversion to use of low-carbon propulsion, which can only but assist with our attempts to reduce our carbon footprint.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is the most important thing that we can do.“We can get back to a ‘normalish’ le. We can get back to what we had before. But the only way we do that is by widespread vaccinations.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He asked Ms Forbes to clary whether or not island councils will be free to use the top up funding to support any businesses, including accommodation providers, to provide parity with support available in the rest of the country.In response, Ms Forbes confirmed that the #top up# announced by the First Minister would ensure businesses in island communities receive the same support, on the same level, as those in Level Four areas.Afterwards, Mr McArthur said: “While the announcement earlier this week of a ‘top up’ fund for island authorities was welcome, it soon became apparent that many businesses, including accommodation providers, were at risk of being excluded.“That was unacceptable and out of step with the assurances I received from the Finance Secretary last week. I’m pleased Kate Forbes has now set the record straight in a response to me at Finance Questions by confirming that island businesses will have access to the same ongoing funding as those in Level Four areas.“This support may be delivered through a Discretionary Fund rather than the Strategic Framework Business Fund, but Ms Forbes could not have been clearer that the effect should be the same.“Hopefully, Orkney Islands Council is now able to put a process in place to allow businesses to begin applying for the support they so desperately need.#He added: “The Finance Secretary also helpfully claried that the ‘top up’ support is over and above what can be accessed through the sector-specic funds, announced at the end of last year.“Details for most of the sector specic funds have not yet been published, but are expected later this month. Ms Forbes insisted that these are open to businesses across Scotland, including the islands”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes on top of £m already committed for education recovery since the start of the pandemic, bringing the total additional support provided to more than £ million since the start of the pandemic.#I appreciate only too well the additional burden home learning is placing on many of our children and their families,# Mr Swinney said.#After the last period of school building closures we commissioned an Equity Audit, published today, to better understand the impact on children’s learning and health and wellbeing, particularly disadvantaged pupils.“Since the start of the pandemic our funding has led to an additional , teachers and over  support staff being appointed. The new funding can be used to recruit further staff # which might include teachers, classroom assistants, administrative staff, home school link workers or other support workers — as well as the resources that families and schools need to support home learning, including additional digital devices where there is any remaining unmet need, and other home learning resources.#Mr Swinney has also asked HM Inspectors of Education to commence with a national review of the quality and effectiveness of remote learning across the country with the first report published next Friday, January .He said: “The quality and effectiveness of remote learning across the country will be reviewed by HM Inspectors of Education. A programme of ‘national overviews’, will commence immediately and last for the duration of remote learning.##These will seek to identy what is working well and where further improvement is required. These overviews will be published weekly to ensure they are available for everyone to learn and build from, starting week ending  January.#Private and third sector day care of children settings are also set to receive almost £ million in temporary financial support.The education secretary added: “I am aware that remaining open for very small numbers of children creates pressure for some childcare providers, and I can therefore confirm we will make temporary financial support of up to £. million available for each four week period of restrictions to day care of children providers and childminding settings caring for  or more children who remain open for vulnerable and keyworker children during these restrictions.#We will confirm details as soon as possible.“If the evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that, and we will ensure the package of mitigations in schools remains robust and tailored to the circumstances we face. As part of that work, we expect that pilots of two dferent testing models – one using in-school testing with Lateral Flow Devices, and another involving at-home testing using PCR tests – will begin in a small number of schools from next week, helping to inform options for wider rollout.“I am grateful to our hardworking, dedicated teaching professionals for their intense work to plan, organise and deliver learning.

As ordinary folk, none of these three ‘coves’ come with the egotism associatedwith this level of stardom. Their down-to-earth attitude, gentle humility and self-confessed naivety of the wider music industry is part of their unique charm and connects them to their fans across the generations who reward them with unwavering loyalty.“The Barrowlands was booked but that sold out just as quickly. Suddenly all the venues sold out, including gigs in London and Manchester. It was unbelievable.”“We are not the type of band that can sit down and invent new materials,” said Innes.“Everything comes out of Boydie’s head and, until it’s ready to be released, it’s not coming. You don’t ask him to do anything. He has a heart of gold and means well to everyone but,you ask him to do something, and he’s not ready for, it will not get done. We are waiting to see what happens with live gigs next year.”Innes confesses to feeling nervous about the uncertainty of the future of live performances. He said: “Over the summer, a lot of people believed the situation with the pandemic would be better but I realised things were getting worse for live music. I really wondered whether Peat  Diesel would ever play live again.“I am, however, a positive person who always sees good things in bad situations. Watching pre-Covid TV programmes where people are sitting closely together does put fear through us though. Until maybe everyone takes this vaccine and Covid goes away, I think live music is really going to struggle.“When we are playing, the crowd sucks up the atmosphere we have created.“If that atmosphere is not there, I don’t think people will enjoy it. For the  tour, I am not sure whether people will be ready to gather or whether they would rather wait that extra while to attend a gig. We will have to wait and see how it goes.”The  tour has been rescheduled for next year, with a gig booked for Skye in the autumn.Innes says he is looking forward to coming back to Skye: “We have played on Skye before and were not sure how they would get us. It was an amazing experience for us, though, as people sang along to the words and really enjoyed the performance.“Despite the sea between us, Skye people are very like us and understand our music.“We decided the tour had to include a venue on Skye as we feel they are our friends and family and a place where we feel at home to be ourselves and enjoy our time there.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/XMAS-HAMPERS-PORTREE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skye community response well","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSCR chair Ross Cowie

but we are better prepared having had that experience and we are ready to help with whatever is required in supporting the community — whether that#s picking up prescriptions, delivering food, fuel, any practical support or just advice.Commenting on the group#s work following the initial lockdown, he added: #We put contingencies in place because we were aware that a second phase was likely, so we

aiming to make a clean sweep across","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSkye Lockdown Litterpick was set up to encourage people to clean up their local area during the tier  lockdown from Christmas into the New Year, and to date more than  people have become members of the Facebook group.With the conditions of lockdown now tightened until at least the end of January, Dunvegan resident Jennie Chapman, who set up the group, believes that the virtual community of litter pickers is empowering people on Skye to do their bit inidually for a collective cause.: “The Facebook group provides a virtual community where anyone living on Skye can get involved in picking up litter in their local area during this — now extended — lockdown period.“We will then collate all the information about quantities collected and map the areas covered so that we can see an ever growing picture of community involvement in making the island cleaner.“You will see, on the page announcements, a map that is updated every couple of days at least.” Commenting on the response to the group, she said: “At the time of writing there are  members of the group.“Many of these are people who I am sure have been concerned about this issue for some time and may well have already been regularly picking up litter on walks.“However, it can feel like a bit of an uphill battle when you do it on your own so this virtual community is so encouraging when you begin to see how many others care and are also wanting to do their part.”Highlighting the scope of the problem, she added: “We are certainly finding that across the island some of the worst spots for littering include along road verges, especially on the larger roads, around parking areas and lay bys and in popular walking spots.“The range of things that we are collecting includes absolutely huge numbers of drinks bottles, cans, coffee cups and snack wrappers — especially those thrown from car windows along verges — and random items such as huge builders bags, car exhaust pipes and even dirty nappies and used condoms.”Addressing the tightened restrictions now in place, Jennie said: “Everyone taking part is doing so either on their own or in accordance with all now further tightened legal requirements for meeting outside — so from now that will be only with one other person at most and remaining at full social distance.“We have found that two people working to collect from either side of a road verge works well.“All collections are then reported into the group on Facebook for mapping.“At the time of writing we have so far logged  large bin bags full of rubbish being removed from  dferent locations around the island as well as at least  large objects – and we have at least all of January to go!“You will see from the map that the project has now spread to all four corners of the island.”While Jennie acknowledges that the group itself is not a stand-alone solution to the issue, she does hope that it might have a positive effect and persuade people to think twice about littering.She said: “Although this is a short-term project the longer-term issue is unlikely to go away anytime soon so we hope that at least the project raises awareness of the issue.“And maybe it will encourage some people to take their rubbish home rather than littering the countryside and encourages everyone who takes part in trying to keep their local area clean.“There are lots of us out there and we are all part of a bigger picture.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/KYLE-E-BIKES-1-scaled.jpg","title":"saddling up for

Skye and Lochalsh LGOWIT co-ordinator Kate Hathway purchased the bikes on behalf of the project following a successful bid to the Energy Saving Trust last year.. “Kyle had been identied as a priority area and electric bikes looked like a good option for a wide age range of folk.”The e-bikes were delivered a month into the first lockdown so were quickly utilised by key workers. Since their arrival there have been  free trials, averaging three weeks per user. Common long-term conditions are arthritis, fibromyalgia, joint-replacement rehabilitation, anxiety and depression and those who struggle with weight bearing exercise. The bikes are stored on Church Road and are maintained by Kate’s husband, Ian Mackay, owner of Skye MTB Adventures.“While we have prioritised people with long-term conditions –around  per cent of users – we’ve also enabled wider members of the community to trial them as it’s better that they’re out and about all the time,” said Kate. “With the dferent power setting options the bikes can be as easy or as challenging as you want them to be.“Initially a taxi-trike was purchased along with four bikes but it just couldn’t cope with the hills in the area, so an additional two bikes will be bought to replace the trike.“It’s a shame because the idea of the trike was to help combat isolation and get folk stuck at home out and about in the fresh air,” Kate said.The project is due to continue until August  and between now and then LGOWIT will consider legacy ideas for the e-bikes beyond that date.“If the Skye cycle way ever gets developed then it would be great to have a fleet of e-bikes available for the community as part of a network joining Kyle, Kyleakin and Broadford and so that would definitely be a good option to explore,” Kate added.If you would like a free trial of an e-bike contact Kate Hathway on ,   or lgowitkate@highlandtsi.org.uk"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1611074347797.jpg--covid_19___tue_19th_jan.jpg?1611074347000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210119newscovid 19 tue 19th jan","story":" The NI Department of Health dashboard shows a further  coronavirus related deaths and  new positive cases.  deaths occurred outside of the current reporting period.

He writes:  “It was particularly galling reading and listening to Ian Paisley’s criticism on the outworking of brexit given that he and the DUP colleagues were its biggest cheerleaders. “Brexit was always going to be an unmitigated disaster. That was particularly obviously going to be the case for businesses, farmers, the agri food sector and consumers living on the island of Ireland. “Either Ian Paisley and the DUP were too foolish to recognise that fact, or too cavalier with their perceived influence that they didn’t care about its impact on the business community, on traders, on retail, on agriculture and on every aspect of society that have been talking up the impact that Brexit would have on the North. “The penny may have finally dropped on Ian now, but his attempts at trying to use the Irish protocol to deflect from his and his party’s stupidly to placate his base is fooling nobody. When it comes to any damage caused by Brexit on the people of the North the blame lies fair and square at the door of the DUP and their Tory cohorts. “They can huff and puff all they want but the reality is there in black and white. We all heard the DUP comments throughout the brexit debate. How they did not care about the implications as long as they were out of the European Union. CHIPPY“We all heard Sammy Wilson telling MP’s to ‘go to the chippy’ during a discussion about possible food supply issues at supermarkets. “We all witnessed the DUP falling over themselves like idiots to charm Boris Johnston and other right wing Tories at dinners in Ballymena and where. “We saw and heard it all. Yet throughout the four year drama of Brexit we all, except the DUP clearly, knew how it was going to end. “We all tried to tell Ian and the DUP. We tried to tell him about the implications of Brexit and we tried to tell him not to trust the Tories. “We tried to tell him that when it came to the bit the Tories would shaft the DUP in the interests of Southern England. “What we need now is for Ian and the DUP to drop the rhetoric and the nonsense and work with the adults to address the teething problems with the new trading arrangements and work with others to find practical solutions for businesses and traders and that can benefit our economy.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3588647.jpg--.jpg?1611148667000\n","title":"wrightbus announces new jobs for ballymena headquarters","story":" Wrightbus is looking to a positive year ahead with the creation of more than  new jobs at its Ballymena headquarters.Wrightbus, which launched the world’s first zero-emission hydrogen double decker bus in , has created the roles in preparation for increasing production of the vehicle this year to assist global net zero ambitions and support the PM’s pledge for at least , new Zero Emission Buses to be produced during this parliament.A recruitment drive will see it employ  new members of production and office staff, including coachbuilders, spray painters, welders, electrical engineers, technicians, accountants, sales staff and a project manager. Nineteen of the positions will be apprenticeships, giving a boost to opportunities for young people in the region. And an international project engineer role has also been created as the firm looks to increase sales around the world.With interest for the hydrogen double-deckers from UK cities and from around the world, Wrightbus CEO Jo Bamford said the new jobs would allow production to keep up with demand.“There’s no doubt that  was a challenging year for everyone for many reasons,” said Mr Bamford. “We have made huge strides in , despite the year being paralysed by the coronavirus pandemic, yet  is going to be the year hydrogen really makes its mark.“At Wrightbus we have already launched the world’s first zero-emission hydrogen double decker bus and this year will see us deliver signicant orders into London, Birmingham, Belfast and other cities across the UK, including in Northern Ireland.“This recruitment will help us support the Governments investment pledge for at least , zero emission buses on the streets of the UK.“It’s thanks to this and other orders already in the pipeline that we’ve been able to create these jobs. We’re proud to be supporting the local economy and creating opportunities for young people thanks to the apprenticeships we’ve been able to offer.”The hydrogen double deckers created an impact across the UK last year when they were first launched in Aberdeen in October.Speaking at the time of the launch, Aberdeen City Council Co-Leader Councillor Douglas Lumsden had said it was fantastic to see its arrival.“By leveraging our unique assets and capabilities, we will help lead the world on the rapid sht to a net zero future and support the global energy transition as a climate positive city,” he added.Belfast quickly followed, when Northern Ireland’s first hydrogen double deckers launched in the city in December.Speaking at the launch, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was part of an ambitious vision for low-emission public transport.Cleaner, greener, sustainable transport is key to protecting our environment and fighting the climate crisis, she said.I am delighted to see these new buses enter service. They will be transformative for communities here as we seek to deliver more sustainable low carbon public transport.My Department recently allocated funding of almost poundm for the purchase of  zero and low emission buses that will enter the Translink fleet during  .Zero-emission hydrogen buses were also announced in  for Birmingham and London - both cities should see vehicles on the road this year.Mr Bamford added: “We are proud to be playing a pivotal role in the world’s net zero ambitions and this green future - the vision we all have of a zero emission planet - will only be achievedwe all work together.“Hydrogen’s time is now and Wrightbus is excited to be at the vanguard of this revolution.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1611159002795.jpg--covid_19___wed_20th_jan_figures.jpg?1611159002000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210120newscovid 19 wed 20th jan figures","story":" The NI Department of Health dashboard shows a further  coronavirus related deaths and  new positive cases.  deaths occurred outside of the current reporting period.

All other schools who would have normally used the AQE or PPTC transfer tests to select pupils for next September have until Friday, January  to inform the Education Authority of their planned admissions criteria for this year.Most grammar schools who would have used transfer tests have already published what criteria they intended to use in the event transfer tests were cancelled but it is not clearthose will now change.A group of  voluntary sector organisations had urged the Education Minister to direct a common contingency criteria for this year.But Boards of Governors have been tasked with drawing up the new criteria, with the Department of Education only issuing guidelines on what form that criteria should take.Belfast Most ReadEnglish #will not care#Northern Ireland leaves UK for united Ireland, says former Chancellor#Business as usual# says DUP#s Edwin Poots as he awaits cancer surgery‘I despise them’: Carl Frampton breaks silence on split with McGuigansArlene Foster brands republicans behind helicopter shooting as ‘crazed political ideologues’Councillor#s fury after watching police break up house party while we is taken to hospital with Covid-Latest Northern Ireland‘Shame on anybody’ intending to target medical military personnel in hospitals, says Robin Swann Hauliers ‘need financial aid for Irish Sea border’Tributes paid to popular Limavady solicitor David Brewster who died suddenlyUK records its deadliest day of the coronavirus pandemicGovernment not looking to extend grace periods limiting Brexit red tape – LewisLatest from Belfast Latest weekly Covid- rates for local authority areas in EnglandCalls for police to be vaccinated sooner as officer hospitalised with Covid-Indian village cheers for Kamala Harris during swearing-in as US vice presidentIrish premier congratulates Joe Biden on his inauguration as US President‘Shame on anybody’ intending to target medical military personnel in hospitals, says Robin Swann ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Whilst discussions on the final costs for the project cannot conclude until the planning process completes, the GAA remains committed to providing the £m previously pledged to the scheme.Mr Buckley said there was a wide recognition that the current strain on public finances from the pandemic, and the increased cost of the project itself, meant the GAA should increase its contribution.It#s imperative and recognised, even by a former Sinn Fein minister, that the GAA must contribute substantially to the additional funding that will be required, he added.It#s not fair for public services to foot the bill once again. I think it would be a positive move for the GAA to come forward and bear some of that additional cost. I think that would only be right, For the GAA to welch away from that would send very negative signals across our community at a time when our finances are in such a state with Covid-.Ms Ni Chuilin and Sinn Fein were approached but declined to comment.Belfast Most ReadEnglish #will not care#Northern Ireland leaves UK for united Ireland, says former Chancellor#Business as usual# says DUP#s Edwin Poots as he awaits cancer surgery‘I despise them’: Carl Frampton breaks silence on split with McGuigansArlene Foster brands republicans behind helicopter shooting as ‘crazed political ideologues’Councillor#s fury after watching police break up house party while we is taken to hospital with Covid-Latest Northern IrelandAnti-coronavirus vaccination campaign condemned as ‘unhelpful’‘Shame on anybody’ intending to target medical military personnel in hospitals, says Robin Swann Hauliers ‘need financial aid for Irish Sea border’Tributes paid to popular Limavady solicitor David Brewster who died suddenlyUK records its deadliest day of the coronavirus pandemicLatest from Belfast Queen sends private message to President BidenAnti-coronavirus vaccination campaign condemned as ‘unhelpful’Latest weekly Covid- rates for local authority areas in EnglandCalls for police to be vaccinated sooner as officer hospitalised with Covid-Indian village cheers for Kamala Harris during swearing-in as US vice president,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At this stage the university has not confirmed what work is taking place. It is hoped that at some stage the site - along with additional land owned by UU on the Northland Road - will be used to expand the Magee campus. In November  Ulster University lodged a planning application to develop an overspill car park to support the Magee Campus. That application has not been approved, according to the NI planning website. Applications were also submitted in  to demolish buildings on the site to clear the way for future development proposals. googletag.cmd.push If given the go-ahead, the new car park would help ease some of the parking problems that have existed around the Magee campus for many years.  The proposed car park would provide ramped access for cars between the existing roadway and the existing all weather sports pitch. The works to the all sports pitch will comprise patch repairs to the existing surface, reactivating the existing surface drainage, providing directional signage and light fittings mounted on steel poles. Vehicle and pedestrian access into the site will be through the existing openings off the Duncreggan Road. There will be no alterations to the openings. googletag.cmd.push In terms of the demolition plans, those involve the existing standing structures including the main teaching block, pre-fabricated buildings, sports hall and workshop. The application states: The works will involve demolition to below existing ground level. The sub-structure shall remain pending future development proposals. steel concrete structural frames, external walls, mezzanine floors, roofs, windows and external doors, masonry and stud internal walls and partitions, internal doors, wall, floor and ceiling finishes, fittings, furniture and equipment, complete services installations including mechanical systems, electrical systems. Duncreggan House, a B listed Victorian building, adjoins the school. The proposal is to carefully dismantle the structure that connects the listed building with the teaching blocks. The listed building shall not be damaged lost during demolition works.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Turning into the new year has always been the time for making a new start and the football season would be swinging into action.But in the absence of sport, Oran Armstrong has been far from idle. Hetook his inspiration from the mental strain placed on society with the lockdown following the Covid- pandemic. With the Claudy GAA and Dungiven Celtic seasons both on hold, he has also taken to the roads around Claudy, Strabane, Derry and ventured to Benone Strand. Oran, who works as a Customer Protection Analyst for Danske Bank, decided to set himself a running target to link in with Dry January. googletag.cmd.push “Talking with my friends and teammates, there was a general feeling of frustration and the impact that another full lockdown would have on mental health,” Oran said. With no group training and the closure of gyms, the lack of routine was not good for the head and it was time to find a new focus. “Losing routine is not good for mental health both the physical impact and the social impact.” said Oran, who has led an active lestyle since a young age. “Its only when you lose the simple things like training, playing football, going to the gym or meeting your friends for a few pints that you realise how much joy and happiness it brings to our lives,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “I know I am not the only one who feels like this, and a lot of people are feeling the same frustration. Missing that everyday social aspect of le, that we have taken for granted before this pandemic, has left a lot of young people feeling very isolated and alone and Derry has experienced more than its fair share of tragedy as a result of mental health.” That struck a chord with Oran, who has decided to raise funds and help to unite society in these uncertain times. “The charity I am doing this for is Aware NI,” he states. “They are the Derry-born depression charity for Northern Ireland - and the only charity working exclusively for people with depression and bipolar disorder.”     Aware delivers mental health and well-being programmes into communities, schools, colleges, universities and workplaces. These programmes include Mood Mattersprogrammes,Living Le to the Full,Mental Health First AidandMindfulness. Aware’s programmes take a preventative approach to mental ill-health and teach attendees techniques to look after their own mental health and well-being. Oran has raised over pound, so far and is hoping to reach the k mark by the end of the month.

Whether it’s helping to organise a fundraiser, volunteering his time or simply making a donation, Martin has always been more than generous. His kind nature and willingness to put others before himself have meant he has helped many charities and people in need over the years. For Martin, however, he says he only wants to put smiles on faces. Born in Crebarkey, on the outskirts of Dungiven, Martin moved to the north Derry town with his family when he was just five years old. googletag.cmd.push Prior to their arrival in Dungiven, Martin attended the old schoolhouse in Cashel, a journey he made on foot each day alongside his siblings. Following their move to the town, Martin, one of nine children – five boys and four girls – continued with his schooling there. From a young age, Martin always showed a good work ethic, and it wasn’t long before he secured his first part-time job – delivering the Coleraine Chronicle newspaper to locals. “I was still at school at the time, but I really enjoyed that wee job. I had eight dozen papers to deliver at the time and it kept me busy,” laughed Martin. googletag.cmd.push “After that, I got a job on Turner’s block and milk lorry and that was something I really enjoyed too.” Martin recalls a happy childhood growing up and has fond memories of gathering potatoes as a youth and playing marbles with his friends. “When I was younger, we used to kick a ball about the green down at Mitchell Park. There was maybe about  or  of us and we would have played soccer or Gaelic football in dferent wee teams. It was great craic and there was very little traffic about then. “I also remember we used to go down to the ‘Pound House’ and play marbles and stuff. There was an aul footgo down there and we used to go down and swing from it to pass the time. The craic growing up was mighty,” he laughed.     After leaving school, Martin, like many other young men his age, choose a career in the construction industry and over the years he worked on many building sites across the North. Despite working long hours, Martin decided he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, William, and join the local fire service. In , at the age of , Martin joined the local station as a part-time firefighter and said he was ‘proud’ to have worked alongside his late father for a few years prior to his retirement. Recalling his time there, the -year-old says he has many fond memories. “I really enjoyed it and I wore my unorm with pride. I can definitely say I gave it %. I definitely think we made a dference to people’s lives. We gave up our time to do that and we weren’t getting paid for it,” he said. “At that time, I was working as well soyou got the call to an emergency you just had to drop all and go.” Over the years, Martin says there were ‘many good days and many bad days’ working as a firefighter. “We attended a lot of accidents and a lot of fatalities over the years and I’ve seen many things that I’ll never forget. At that time, we would have attended a fatality and then had toto our work after it without getting counselling straight away. The things I witnessed I’ve never talked about and have always kept it to myself. It was tough,” he recalled. However, for Martin, who retired from NIFRS in  after  years’ service, the toughest point in his career came following the tragic death of fellow firefighter and friend, Joe McCloskey. The -year-old Dungiven man, who was also a part-time firefighter, died in a blaze at the Gorteen House Hotel in Limavady on Halloween night . “Joe was  per cent. He was loyal and such a decent person who lived for the fire brigade, and unfortunately died for it,” said Martin. “At the time of his death I was off-duty due to an injury and his death really, really upset me. Joe wasn’t just a colleague he was also a really good friend and I was the best man at his wedding, so we were close. We both went into the fire service at the same time. Dungiven lost a true fire fighter when Joe died,” he added. Not long after joining the fire service, Martin’s fellow colleague, Lenny Maguire, set him up on a blind date. Luckily for Martin, it turned out to be love at first sight, and after several years of courting, he went on to marry his blind date, a young woman called Bernie, from nearby Claudy. Martin and Bernie went on to have three sons together – Christopher, Sean and Stephen. Here they are pictured together.  Sadly, Bernie passed away in  following a hard-fought battle with cancer. “Bernie was such a good person. She was quiet and there was no bother or fuss with her. She was such a kind person and she worked hard in Desmond’s Factory in Claudy for many years, but she got it hard and she suffered with her sickness. We really miss her so much,” he said. Martin, who is well-known for his charitable spirit, says his fundraising all began back when he worked as a part-time firefighter. “Back then we would have done a lot of fundraising for the likes of Children in Need and I suppose that’s when it all started,” he said. Martin also volunteers to steward at many community events and funerals and in the recent past has helped to distribute food hampers to those less fortunate in the community. “I never thought I’d see the something like a global pandemic in my letime, but I think Covid- has been like a wake-up call for the world and people have come to learn to appreciate what they have more. There are many people out there who have been badly affected by it all and it’s been so tough on them. “I like helping other people. I want to do it for them, not for me,” said Martin, adding: “I always put others first before me because I like to see a smile on people’s faces.” Martin’s charity work over the years has not gone unnoticed, with local councillor, Sean McGlinchey nominating him for a community award in . Martin, who went onto win the ‘Spirit of Dungiven’ award for ‘Most Caring Person’, organised by McNicholl’s Eurospar, said he was ‘shocked’. Described as ‘an exceptional and very unique person’, local councillor Sean McGlinchey said: “I’ve never met anyone in this community like Martin and despite everything he’s always smiling and laughing.” Martin said: “I was so surprised when I won the award because I feel there is other people out there who are as good as I am, but I did feel so honoured to win the award. It was really nice to receive it, but I don’t do things for the praise, I do it for the people,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was for the BBC but also had a selected cinemas and festivals run all over the world.”Four years later, Open Reel Productions Ltd was formed to be the documentary production side of things as opposed to a crew hire facility, resulting in a number highly-successful productions.These included:- Inisght: Operation Motormanexamined the role and impact of the largest British Army operation since the Suez Crisis which resulted in the end of Derrys No Go areas.- Exodustold the inside story of why thousands of Protestants left their homes on the ‘west bank’ of Derry, over a  year period.- No Go: The Free Derry Storywas a feature documentary which followed on from ‘Battle of the Bogside, taking up the story from when the British Army arrived on the streets of Derry. It remiered at the Seagate Foyle Film Festival and was nshown at a number of festivals worldwide. It was shortlisted for a number best documentary, including the Wuumlrzburg International Film Festival in German, Grierson Documentary Awards, Londonand the FOCAL Awards, London where it was nominated for Best Use of Footage in a Factual Production.- Battle of the Bogsidewas a feature documentary on the three of riots in Derry that led to the deployment of British troops into Derry in August . Also screened at many film festivals worldwide. It won Best Documentary at the Irish Film and Television Awards and was shortlisted in the Best Documentary Feature category at the Galway Film Festival and Best Historical Documentary at the Grierson Documentary Awards.- Teenage Kicks: The Undertones– a documentary film about one of the most successful bands to come out of Derry was presented by the legendary TV presenter John Peel. Two versions of the film were made one for BBC transmission, the other for Cinema Screenings. It ws screened at every major film festival and was released on DVD by Sanctuary Records and then Union Square Music. It was shortlisted for Best Arts Documentary at the Celtic Film Festival and Best Documentary Feature’ at the Galway Film Fleadh. - Insight: The Bad Applewas a -minute documentary filmed in Derry, Belfast and New York and told the story centred on one elderly Derry woman’s fight with the New York Police Department to prove that an off-duty policeman murdered her son in the Big Apple. It was the first time ever that an independent production company was commissioned by UTV to produce an episode of their flagship current affairs series and achieved a record for viewing figures - % of Northern Ireland watched the programme when transmitted on January , . Looking back, Vinny regards the team as his second family.“From a crew point of view, well, its been nearly  years now since we became self-employed and its always been one year at a time. Well keep saying that as thats all that you can do, whilst keep planning ahead with ideas and so on.“Its tough most of the time financially as youre constantly having to buy the latest kit every two years. “Apart from the work weve been doing with Joe, Patrick, Orlagh, Emma and Sarah at Westway Films every year, it would have to be archive films with John Petoas my co-producer director.“They are my second family now - weve been filming together since .“It is still great fun and we all know how each other ticks. Wed need to at this stage.” Among the shows they have worked on are Lesser Spotted Ulster, Lesser Spotted Journeys, Ulster Giants and more recently, Lough Foyle.“I have enjoyed all of it, to be honest, getting to travel the country and see all these previously unseen places or find out things about places that wed seen many times.”Like many, Vinny, did not escape the fall-out from the coronavirus pandemic. “it was tough at the start but at least most of our work was postponed rather than cancelled. There are, and will be, very many businesses and self-employed worse off. Joe interviewing people from two metres away is an experience.” At present, Vinny is involved in making  programmes for a new series of Mahons Way for UTV as well as working on a few ideas himself for submission to broadcasters.He is doing all that on top of enjoying being in the company of one special person.“I became a grandfather for the first time in January , so I am enjoying as much time as possible with the now two-year-old Casey.” googletag.cmd.push  googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are only a few weeks into the year, but successive Wednesdays have seen an attack on the legislative part of the US Government, an historic second impeachment and then on Wednesday, January , , Joseph R Biden and Kamala D Harris will be inaugurated as the leaders of the Executive Branch of Government in the United States. These events have usually happened over decades, but in keeping with the events of , the apparent drama and speed of occurrences appears to be of little surprise to most political observers. googletag.cmd.push Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made history when they amassed  million votes at the beginning of November. Biden will become the oldest and only the second Catholic to become US President. Biden, of course, also wears his Irish heritage as a badge of honour and has already appointed a prominent member of the Irish American Community, Marty Walshas his new Secretary of Labour. Harris will become the first woman of Indian Caribbean ancestry to hold a Vice-Presidential office. They received a record number of votes in any US democratic election and are mandated, amongst other things, to take control of the pandemic in the USA which is now claiming about , lives per day. googletag.cmd.push Biden and Harris are also hopeful with Democratic control of both Houses of Congress to pass a series of economic stimulus Bills to make societal and business improvements. Their inauguration therefore is an historic event in any other year. But in , it has the added intrigue of being an occasion which will have at least , armed US National Guards in the US Capitol. Not since the first inauguration of Lincoln in  has the US witnessed such a military presence at the swearing-in of a President. This is due in no small part to what the New York Times stated that ‘Sixteen groups — some of them armed and most of them hard-line supporters of President Trump — have registered to stage protests in Washington, prompting deep concern among federal officials about an event that has historically been a packed celebration of American democracy.’     But why is this level of protest happening  The United States is a ided nation in many respects - borne out of its history, culturally, racially, socio-economically, even religiously. Biden’s victory, while statistically impressive and involving the biggest defeat faced by an incumbent President since , has not been legitimately accepted by the outgoing President. Since the wee hours of November th, President Trump has declined to accept the electoral outcome and through social media, legal challenges and concerns raised by many members of his Republican Party, he has sought to challenge the validity of the democratic will of the American people. For many commentators, this has allowed a narrative to develop that the election was unfairly stolen from Trump and a consistent and continual challenge to Biden and Harris’ victory has given many of Trump’s supporters what they perceive to be a constitutional right to contest the results of November . The result of the anger, fomented by many extremists, was demonstrated in the aftermath of a rally led by Trump and his political and legal supporters on the first Wednesday of the New Year - January th, . As many witnessed, a crowd of thousands invaded the US Capitol building. Their ultimate goals may have been ied, but to some, it was believed that they wanted to overturn the constitutional process of counting each states Electoral College votes for Biden and declare Trump as the rightful winner of the election. These stunning developments ended in panic, fear, and tragedy as at least five people were known to have died as a result of these events. Subsequent eye-witness accounts that are still emerging, show the intent of many of the ‘mob’, ying from ransacking the Legislative chambers of the House of Representatives and Senate to the attempted assassination of members of Congress. The second Wednesday culminated in the historic impeachment of Donald Trump on charges of incitement of insurrection. This bi-partisan vote was notable for the fact that it was the largest bi-partisan vote in terms of impeachment in US History. However, it was momentous in the fact that for the first time a sitting US President who had lost the popular vote twice, was now impeached twice. Many representatives from the Democratic Party railed against Trump’s words and actions over the previous two months and they were aided by an incredible level of support from a senior Republican, Liz Cheney. As thestated: ‘In a strongly worded statement released on Tuesday, Cheney, said that Trump had “summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing,” she said. “None of this would have happened without the president. I will vote to impeach the president.” Trump’s trial will begin after Biden’s inauguration and  US Senators will need to vote to convict him of high crimes and misdemeanours. The third eventful Wednesday of  will ultimately see Biden and Harris be inaugurated in a ided and fearful US capital. Even with the concern caused by opponents of the Democratic leaders, the Biden team, according to the New York Times has stated that ‘he was determined to make an outdoor appearance at the event to call on a ided nation to come together at a time of political and public health crisis.’ Both leaders have an awesome task of uniting a ided country and finding a speedier way to help the nation recover from the coronavirus pandemic and its social and economic consequences. Plans are afoot for a . trillion-dollar economic stimulus package and to re-engage with the Paris Climate Agreement. Biden’s approach to Ireland, both North and South in the wake of our concerns with coronavirus and the economic and political fallout of Brexit will also be of huge signicance. Ireland and the rest of the world will be watching with interest to witness what future Wednesdayswill bring in .    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In this, the first of a series of articles on the most common  local surnames, he explores the background of the names Doherty, McLaughlin, Gallagher and Kelly.  - DOHERTY The surname Doherty, which is by far the most popular name in the city of Derry and the Inishowen peninsula, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. googletag.cmd.push The Doherty sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push The Dohertys take their name from Dochartach, twelfth in lineal descent from Conall Gulban and were thus in Gaelic O Dochartaigh. The word dochartach means ‘hurtful’. The original seat of the Doherty clan was at Ardmire or Ard Miodhair, a district to the west of Ballybofey near Lough Finn, County Donegal. In  Donnell Carragh O’Doherty was styled ‘Royal Chieftain of Ardmire’. As the original homeland of the Cenel Eoghainin Inishowen became more and more a northern outpost, as they expanded south and east, the O’Dohertys, a powerful branch of the Cenel Conaill , forced their way into Inishowen.     When Conor O’Doherty died in  he was styled ‘Chief of Ardmire, and Lord of Inishowen’. The Dohertys remained the chief family of Inishowen until their influence was broken after the rebellion of Sir Cahir O’Doherty in , which included the ransacking of the city of Derry. The defeat and execution of Sir Cahir O’Doherty marked the end of Doherty power and paved the way for the th century Plantation of Ulster with English and Scottish settlers. In the centuries that followed the name was anglicised with many iant spellings and in nearly all cases the O prefix was dropped. By  only  per cent were still using it. However, in the th century, many resumed it and by  half of the Dohertys in Ireland had become O’Doherty again.In the th and th centuries many descendants of the old Gaelic order in Ireland emigrated, as the so-called Wild Geese, to Europe, and, in particular, to Spain and France. Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated in July  as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen. Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sir Cahir’s brother John who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, which tradition states was carried from Grianan, in the grounds of the former Belmont House School in Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: The claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood.   – MCLAUGHLIN  The surname McLaughlin, which is second to Doherty in both Derry city and Inishowen, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. Today, % of Donegal McLaughlins are still concentrated in the Inishowen peninsula. The McLaughlin sept trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to the Inishowen peninsula between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula still called after him Inishowen . Eogan was converted to Christianity by St Patrick, when he travelled to Ailech, ca.  AD. His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The McLaughlins take their name from Lochlainn, which in turn was derived from a Norse personal name, and were thus in Gaelic Mac Lochlainn, i.e. son of Lochlainn. The McLaughlins were initially the senior branch of the Northern Ui Neill and their territory was in Inishowen. In the th century the McLaughlins, ruling from their royal palace at Ailech in Inishowen, were High Kings of Ireland and patrons of the monastic settlement in Derry. Domhnall Mac Lochlainn, styled ‘King of Ireland’, died at Doire-Choluim-Chillein . After a decisive battle in  at Caimeirgethe O’Neills of Tyrone ousted the McLaughlins as the leading power in Ulster. Brian O’Neill was now ‘installed in the lordship of the Kinel-Owen’. In the th century the Dohertys ousted the McLaughlins as Lords of Inishowen. Some McLaughlins in Ulster, particularly Antrim, may derive from the Argyllshire clan known in Scotland as MacLachlan. The O’Melaghlins of north Leinster have also changed their name to McLaughlin.   - GALLAGHER  Gallagher is the third most common name in Ulster and two-thirds of the Ulster total are in the sept’s homeland of County Donegal where it is the most numerous name. Although it is only the thirteenth most common name in County Derry, it is the third most numerous in the city of Derry. This name illustrates the very close links between the city of Derry and County Donegal. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Donegal. The Gallagher sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Conall, styled ‘King of Tir Conaill’, established his own kingdom in County Donegal called after him Tyrconnel, i.e. the ‘Land of Conall’, which was the ancient name of Donegal. His descendants, known as the Cenel Conaill , formed one of the principal branches of the Northern Ui Neill . The septs of the Cenel Conaill firmly established themselves in County Donegal while those descended from Conal’s brother Eogan expanded to the east and south into Counties Derry and Tyrone. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The Gallaghers take their name from Gallchobhair, and were thus in Gaelic O Gallchobhair, i.e. descendant of Gallagher. This name is derived from gallchobhar, meaning ‘foreign help’. The O’Gallaghers claim to be the senior and most loyal family of the Cenel Conaill. Their territory extended over a wide area in the baronies of Raphoe and Tirhugh in the east and south of County Donegal. The O’Gallaghers, from their bases at Ballybeit and Ballynaglack, were chief marshals and commanders of O’Donnell’s military forces from the th to the th centuries. The O’Gallaghers also provided many wives for the O’Donnell sept. As well as being a military family the Gallaghers have produced many churchmen. Six O’Gallaghers were bishops of Raphoe in the th and th centuries, and Redmond O Gallagher, the th century Bishop of Derry, befriended the survivors of the Spanish Armada. Today the name is found widely in Scotland where it often takes the form Gallacher. It also occurs in the English cities of Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds where it is pronounced ‘Gallocher’.   – KELLY  Kelly is the second commonest family name in Ireland, after Murphy, and part of the reason is that, at least seven and possibly as many as ten distinct septs of the same name arose in dferent parts of the country. Kelly is the sixth most common name in Ulster, and the third most numerous in Counties Derry and Tyrone. The Kelly sept of County Derry trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula in County Donegal still called after him Inishowen . His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Kelly is derived from Gaelic O Ceallaigh, the root word possibly being ceallach meaning stre. The O’Kellys were one of the leading septs of Clan Binnypossessing territory on the banks of the River Foyle near Lford in County Donegal. The first outward thrust of the Owen clan was that of Clan Binny in the th century AD who thrust southeast into County Tyrone, bypassing a hard core of resistance in County Derry of the Cianachta, as far as the river Blackwater on the borders of Tyrone and Armagh. Clan Binny eventually ousted the Oriella clans from the district lying west of the river Bann from Coleraine to beside Lough Neagh, and drove them across the river. In the course of time the O’Kellys moved eastwards into County Derry and were based in the barony of Loughinsholin in south Derry. The most powerful Kelly sept was that of Ui Maine, often called Hy Many, who ruled O’Kelly’s Country in Counties Galway and Roscommon. This sept claims descent from the th century Colla da Crioch, King of Ulster and first King of Oriel. Other O’Kelly septs originated in Counties Kilkenny, Leix, Meath, Sligo and Wicklow. Kelly was known as a surname in Scotland long before th century Irish immigration really established the name there. There was, for example, a Kelly sept attached to Clan Donald. In Thursdays Derry News, Brian Mitchell looks at the history of the names Moore, Coyle, Harkin and Bradley.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was announced last night that the AQE transfer test for primary seven pupils in Northern Ireland, which had been scheduled to take place on February , has been cancelled. AQE have also said that no test will take place this school year. The single test was scheduled after the three tests due to take place in January were cancelled. Post-primary transfer tests are used to select pupils by the majority of NI grammar schools. A number of grammar schools had already said they would not use the test to select pupils this year. googletag.cmd.push Grammar schools who were planning to use the AQE test will now have to find alternative arrangements to admit pupils in . After the announcement was made last night, Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted: “AQE have decided, due to COVID-, that the transfer tests cannot proceed this year. This severely limits parental choice  children’s opportunities, with disappointment for many children  parents. I will continue to work with all stakeholders in these dficult circumstances.” However, his comments were taken by some as criticism of non-grammar schools. In response, Katrina Crilly, principal of Oakgrove College in Derry, wrote: “What a limited comment! This may be your perspective Minister narrow as it is, are you not the Education Minister for all our children and all our schools ” googletag.cmd.push Deirdre OKane, principal of St Patricks and St Brigids in Claudy, wrote: “Mr Weir. As principal of an exceptional non selective school, I an saddened by such a disgraceful, insensitive remark. Having attended a non- selective school myself, I was not, limited.” Martine Mulhern, principal of St Cecilias College in Derry, wrote: “This year we were named ‘UK Secondary School of the Year’ but here in N Ireland our education system will always deem us ‘second class’ because we are a secondary school and not grammar! Described by our own Education Minister as ‘limiting children’s opportunities’ - HOW DARE HE!” Mr Weir later tried to clary his comments by tweeting: “Great opportunities exist throughout our education system, thru both selective and non selective schools, all of which have produced the best of Northern Ireland. Once opportunity to be considered for entry to any school is denied,in any sector, it is a denial to opportunity  all.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Very fond memories of her from school and ious productions. She was an inspirational lady. My thoughts are with her family and friends.” Gillian Brown wrote: “I remember her as an enthusiastic and inspiring teacher in the classroom and I was also lucky enough to work behind the scenes on some of the amazing productions listed above.

His father was often unable to work due to illness, so the family had to scrape by on just a few pounds a week. In the years since then, Albert has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to end poverty and save lives in the world’s poorest countries. Now aged , he has pledged to leave a gt in his Will to Christian Aid. Albert, who lives in the Waterside, is a lelong humanitarian, a leading Church of Ireland layman and a stalwart supporter of Christian Aid. His le of service to his Church and to more than  charities was recognised with the award of an MBE. googletag.cmd.push In fact, Albert has received so many plaudits and awards that his we has dedicated an entire room of their home to display them. But his early years were tough. “My father, Joseph, drove a horse and cart, delivering goods from the railway station to shops and offices,” he said. “His asthma meant that he couldn’t work for many months at a time and often we wouldn’t even have the money to buy coal. “My mother, Elizabeth, looked after the home and family. She was very house proud. But she suffered illness for many years and died when she was just . googletag.cmd.push “I was the third of four children – I’m the only one left. We lived in a small house on the Dungiven Road without electricity or running water. There was no bathroom, just an outside toilet. I was born two years before the outbreak of the Second World War and I remember the blackouts and the food rationing. An air-raid shelter was built immediately outside our front door, so close that it blocked our light and we lived in near-darkness. Times were hard then.” Albert began his career as an apprentice engineer at the local Electric Light Station, aged , before moving to Coolkeeragh Power Station where he was engineer-in-charge from  until his early retirement in .     But it was his decades of unpaid work for the Church of Ireland, Christian Aid and dozens of other charities that earned him an MBE in  and saw him named ‘Pensioner of the Year,’ a decade later. He has also been made a Knight of the Order of St John and in , he was among eight people from Northern Ireland selected to attend a special reception at Buckingham Palace to mark UK Year of the Volunteer. A member of Glendermott Church of Ireland near Altnagelvin Hospital, Albert recently completed  years service in a iety of positions in his parish. His Christian faith and his compassion for those living in extreme poverty led him to become involved with Bishops’ Appeal – the Church of Ireland’s world develop- ment committee which raises funds to support the work of Christian Aid and other agencies. For  years, he sat on the board of Bishops’ Appeal, raising funds throughout the Derry and Raphoe diocese and travelling by train to board meetings in Dublin. And he’s proud of his staying power. “I didn’t just stay with an organisation for five years, I stayed for  or  years.” During those years, Albert persuaded churches in the Derry and Raphoe diocese to support Bishops’ Appeal. “I used to ring them up and make a nuisance of myself. By the time I’d finished, % of the churches were contributing to Bishops’ Appeal.” He recalls two fundraising campaigns in particular. “We raised pound, for projects in Kenya but then we set ourselves a target to raise pound, to buy mosquito nets for Nigeria. I doubted we would ever reach that target because the pound, for Kenya had been a real struggle but Ken Goodtold me to have faith. In fact, we raised pound,. Those mosquito nets help to prevent malaria and saved countless lives.” Between  and , Albert also helped to govern Christian Aid Ireland, serving the maximum eight-year term on its board. In , he visited Christian Aid projects in India, an experience that has stayed with him since. “I couldn’t believe the poverty. There were no toilets, no running water. Children without clothes or food. Women carrying basins of cement on their heads. You have to see the conditions there to believe them. It was really shocking.” On hishome, Albert spoke in churches throughout the Derry and Raphoe diocese and gave interviews to radio stations and newspapers, inspiring others to support Christian Aid’s work. So, why has he decided to leave a gt in his Will to Christian Aid  “I want to carry on my le’s work after I’m gone,” he said. Albert has been married to Vivian since . The couple have two daughters, Gillian and Nicola, and four grandchildren.  He said his family were supportive of his decision to leave a gt in his Will. “I’ve really enjoyed my le. I’m grateful because when I was , I had rheumatic fever and a heart murmur. My GP said he doubted I would see . Im now in my s, so I feel very blessed.” Deborah Doherty, Christian Aid Ireland’s former Head of Supporter Engagement, praised the Alberts commitment. “He is a man of great integrity and honesty, and a man of his word. If he agreed to take on a role, he would complete it to the very best of his ability. There was no such thing as attending two meetings out of four Albert would attend every meeting, even during the Troubles and despite having to travel home late at night - whether or not there was snow on the Glenshane Pass. “I never once saw him lose his temper or raise his voice. He is a very reliable person and a very generous person.” However, Albert saves his last words for his we of  years. “I want to acknowledge that the work I’ve done to support charities and my church wouldn’t have been possible without the kindness and support of my we, Vivian. “She’s been my rock throughout and to her I express my heartfelt thanks.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His father was often unable to work due to illness, so the family had to scrape by on just a few pounds a week. In the years since then, Albert has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to end poverty and save lives in the world’s poorest countries. Now aged , he has pledged to leave a gt in his Will to Christian Aid. Albert, who lives in the Waterside, is a lelong humanitarian, a leading Church of Ireland layman and a stalwart supporter of Christian Aid. His le of service to his Church and to more than  charities was recognised with the award of an MBE. googletag.cmd.push In fact, Albert has received so many plaudits and awards that his we has dedicated an entire room of their home to display them. But his early years were tough. “My father, Joseph, drove a horse and cart, delivering goods from the railway station to shops and offices,” he said. “His asthma meant that he couldn’t work for many months at a time and often we wouldn’t even have the money to buy coal. “My mother, Elizabeth, looked after the home and family. She was very house proud. But she suffered illness for many years and died when she was just . googletag.cmd.push “I was the third of four children – I’m the only one left. We lived in a small house on the Dungiven Road without electricity or running water. There was no bathroom, just an outside toilet. I was born two years before the outbreak of the Second World War and I remember the blackouts and the food rationing. An air-raid shelter was built immediately outside our front door, so close that it blocked our light and we lived in near-darkness. Times were hard then.” Albert began his career as an apprentice engineer at the local Electric Light Station, aged , before moving to Coolkeeragh Power Station where he was engineer-in-charge from  until his early retirement in .     But it was his decades of unpaid work for the Church of Ireland, Christian Aid and dozens of other charities that earned him an MBE in  and saw him named ‘Pensioner of the Year,’ a decade later. He has also been made a Knight of the Order of St John and in , he was among eight people from Northern Ireland selected to attend a special reception at Buckingham Palace to mark UK Year of the Volunteer. A member of Glendermott Church of Ireland near Altnagelvin Hospital, Albert recently completed  years service in a iety of positions in his parish. His Christian faith and his compassion for those living in extreme poverty led him to become involved with Bishops’ Appeal – the Church of Ireland’s world develop- ment committee which raises funds to support the work of Christian Aid and other agencies. For  years, he sat on the board of Bishops’ Appeal, raising funds throughout the Derry and Raphoe diocese and travelling by train to board meetings in Dublin. And he’s proud of his staying power. “I didn’t just stay with an organisation for five years, I stayed for  or  years.” During those years, Albert persuaded churches in the Derry and Raphoe diocese to support Bishops’ Appeal. “I used to ring them up and make a nuisance of myself. By the time I’d finished, % of the churches were contributing to Bishops’ Appeal.” He recalls two fundraising campaigns in particular. “We raised pound, for projects in Kenya but then we set ourselves a target to raise pound, to buy mosquito nets for Nigeria. I doubted we would ever reach that target because the pound, for Kenya had been a real struggle but Ken Goodtold me to have faith. In fact, we raised pound,. Those mosquito nets help to prevent malaria and saved countless lives.” Between  and , Albert also helped to govern Christian Aid Ireland, serving the maximum eight-year term on its board. In , he visited Christian Aid projects in India, an experience that has stayed with him since. “I couldn’t believe the poverty. There were no toilets, no running water. Children without clothes or food. Women carrying basins of cement on their heads. You have to see the conditions there to believe them. It was really shocking.” On hishome, Albert spoke in churches throughout the Derry and Raphoe diocese and gave interviews to radio stations and newspapers, inspiring others to support Christian Aid’s work. So, why has he decided to leave a gt in his Will to Christian Aid  “I want to carry on my le’s work after I’m gone,” he said. Albert has been married to Vivian since . The couple have two daughters, Gillian and Nicola, and four grandchildren.  He said his family were supportive of his decision to leave a gt in his Will. “I’ve really enjoyed my le. I’m grateful because when I was , I had rheumatic fever and a heart murmur. My GP said he doubted I would see . Im now in my s, so I feel very blessed.” Deborah Doherty, Christian Aid Ireland’s former Head of Supporter Engagement, praised the Alberts commitment. “He is a man of great integrity and honesty, and a man of his word. If he agreed to take on a role, he would complete it to the very best of his ability. There was no such thing as attending two meetings out of four Albert would attend every meeting, even during the Troubles and despite having to travel home late at night - whether or not there was snow on the Glenshane Pass. “I never once saw him lose his temper or raise his voice. He is a very reliable person and a very generous person.” However, Albert saves his last words for his we of  years. “I want to acknowledge that the work I’ve done to support charities and my church wouldn’t have been possible without the kindness and support of my we, Vivian. “She’s been my rock throughout and to her I express my heartfelt thanks.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Limavady United are deeply saddened to hear of the death of our former vice chairman and long time club supporter David Brewster, read a statement on the clubs Twitter account. Our thoughts go out to David’s friends and family at this sad time. David was a regular contributor to the County Derry Post, with his reports from Limavady games. David was an important cog to the promotion of local sport, said Sports Editor Michael McMullan. googletag.cmd.push His reports were both punctual and very detailed. My thoughts are with his family, friends and everyone in Limavady United. He was also named on the Causeway historical group for the NI centenary working group. Derry City FCs club account also passed on their condolences. Motherwell U manager Diarmuid OCarroll also posted a tribute. Terrible news.. I had multiple meetings with David over the years, a true gent and a massive influence on the game in the area, OCaroll tweeted. My thoughts are with his family and all at the club. Football author Colin Millar also left a message. Such sad news - a wonderful ambassador for the club and the man synonymous with Limavady United.

Brewster, a solicitor in Limavady, was well-known in local sporting circles and was Vice-Chairman of the club. Limavady United are deeply saddened to hear of the death of our former vice chairman and long time club supporter David Brewster, read a statement on the clubs Twitter account. Our thoughts go out to David’s friends and family at this sad time. David was a regular contributor to the County Derry Post, with his reports from Limavady games. David was an important cog to the promotion of local sport, said Sports Editor Michael McMullan. googletag.cmd.push His reports were both punctual and very detailed. My thoughts are with his family, friends and everyone in Limavady United. He was also named on the Causeway historical group for the NI centenary working group. Derry City FCs club account also passed on their condolences. Motherwell U manager Diarmuid OCarroll also posted a tribute. Terrible news.. I had multiple meetings with David over the years, a true gent and a massive influence on the game in the area, OCaroll tweeted. My thoughts are with his family and all at the club. Football author Colin Millar also left a message. Such sad news - a wonderful ambassador for the club and the man synonymous with Limavady United. Deepest sympathies to his family and friends, stated Millar, who wrote The Frying Pan of Spain on the rivalry of Sevilla v Real Betis. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While all of this is well rehearsed, it is no less important because it has been said so many times before.ldquoOne of the first things for me is about all of us behaving aswe have Covid, in terms of social distancing, hand washing and minimising contacts.She appealed to people to only come to hospital when they need to and not to turn up when they donrsquot need to.ldquoWe know that there are instances where it is absolutely vitally important that people present themselvesthey have chest pain orthey think they are having a stroke. It is really important to emphasise that the service is still here for you, continued Ms Patterson.ldquoBut equally for those who do not require an emergency service or hospital at this point in time, we are appealing to you to make these measured judgements.The nursing director said as the coming weeks are going to be dficult, hospitals are not going to be able to care for everyone in the way they normally would, insisting that everyone will do their very best across the organisation to help and support staff to do their best.Ms Patterson added: ldquoWe want to thank those people who have complied with all the guidance. There are many people who have been very good, especially those who are vulnerable and face challenging conditions. What we now need is for more people to follow public health advice to help stop the spread of the virus.Mr Charlie Martyn, the health trustrsquos medical director, said people needed to do more to contain the virus.ldquoWe have all seen people out walking, congregating and meeting up. What we are seeing now around the mixing that has occurred and people meeting over Christmas and New Year is pressures on the wider health system, he said.ldquoWe all need to do better as iniduals and ask people to look at their inidual and collective compliance because we need to get out of this.

It is also something that we must get right given that this is the last remaining town centre site available for development, he continued. ldquoI firmly believe that this eagerly-awaited regeneration scheme can provide a boost for existing businesses.It has been reported that several High Street retailers have expressed an interest in opening stores at this part of the town and it remains to be seenthis interest remains in the light of the continuing coronavirus pandemic.Cllr Curran hopes these leading retailers remain committed to Downpatrick to trade alongside existing businesses, many of them family-owned.He continued: ldquoThe Irish Street redevelopment proposal offers great potential and can provide a vibrant retail hub that will benefit the business community increasing footfall.ldquoAs I have previously said, the redevelopment of this large, town centre area provides a unique opportunity, the like of which is simply never going to be available again. The project has the potential to help transform Downpatrickrsquos economic fortunes and we need to get this right.ldquoPeople want to see progress and it is important that we keep the public as informed as possible about progress on this eagerly-anticipated scheme.Cllr Curran said the completion of the development brief was key to moving forward and he was keen to see work commencing to transform the Irish Street and boost Downpatrickrsquos economic fortunes..prettyPhoto.jpg\" alt\"\" width\"\" border\"\"  "},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th January 2021 Megan.jpg","title":"Megan’s amazing eight and a half stone weight loss  ","story":"MEGAN Rice walked through the doors of Slimming World ready to change her le around.She knew it was going require commitment and working alongside her consultant and group support.Megan was ready to do so and is glad she did as she has lost an amazing eight-and-a-half stones.ldquoMy downfall was takeaways, she admitted. ldquoI just loved them and they were an easy fix.ldquoBut at Slimming World I learned to adapt and make my own lsquofakeawaysrsquo, swapping fried rice for boiled rice and making SW chips at home.ldquoIrsquom a vegetarian and use a lot of Quorn.

Ardnabannon is the ideal location for this with the Mournes looking down on you and the sea on on the other side. The site really lends itself to what we are planning to do, added Mr Cunningham.Local politicians say they are fully supportive of MYMYrsquos proposal for the Ardnabannon site and are keen to see the former outdoor education centre redeveloped for community use.They also appreciate the work the charity carries out across the district and are in no doubt that the current education property and surrounding land can be fully utilised for the good of the communityMYMY is allowed to proceed with its proposal..prettyPhoto.jpg\" alt\"\" width\"\" border\"\"  "},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th January 2021 Relief.jpg","title":"Relief and frustration at cancellation of exams  ","story":"SCHOOL principals and students have spoken of their relief and frustration over the cancellation of GCSE and A-Level exams over the coronavirus pandemic for the second year running.Education Minister Peter Weir announced his intention last week as secondary level students resumed remote learning after the Christmas break.Schools are waiting on receiving guidance from the Department of Education on how grades will be calculated and next steps are required for students and teachers.Mr Joe McCann, principal of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick said that while he recognised that it was a dficult decision, he welcomed the clarity.He added: ldquoNew questions are raised and students will now be wondering how their grades will be calculated and what procedures and processes will be put in place to ensure that awarding is a fair refection of their effort and attainment to date.ldquoYear  in particular had seen no real reduction in the course content needing to be covered this year. This will be a relief to them though a disappointment that the GCSE English and Maths modules scheduled for January  and  were cancelled at such short notice.However, he warned that the mistakes from last summer when controversial A-Level grades had to be amended must not be allowed to happen again.ldquoMany of the dficulties experienced in the summer of  must be avoided and the lessons learned used to inform the way ahead.ldquoWe have to resist the use algorithms to calculate inidual pupil results and awarding bodies must trust teacher professionalism coupled with rigorous checks and balances put in place by school leaders to ensure consistency.Down High School principal Mrs Maud Perry said: ldquoPupils are fully engaged in remote learning. Education is so much more than preparation for an exam and pupils will need to be well equipped for their next steps.She said that a DENI circular on remote learning was also received by schools last week which draws together key learning points from the last period of lockdown.Mrs Perry added: ldquoIt was reassuring to read that research confirms that we are on the correct path. The effectiveness of remote teaching is determined by the same factors as effective live classroom teaching. Keeping in touch is so important for pupil wellbeing.Mr Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, said he was relieved that the ldquoinevitable decision to cancel GCSEs and A Levels had been been made.ldquoWe now await guidance as to how grades will be awarded this year, he remarked.ldquoWhen this information is received it will give staff, students, and parents clarity as to the way forward for schools to see us safely through the rest of this academic year, he added.Ms Jenner King, vice principal of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, described the decision as ldquosensible, but said she was disappointed it had not been made sooner.ldquoThe main premise for all examinations is fairness and with the number of pupils missing out because of Covid-related absences, running the examinations as standard was never going to be fair, she saidldquoOur staff and pupils have been preparing and working hard towards this eventuality, and our hope now is that the Minister and CCEA act swtly to issue detail on the alternative. Any further delay will only serve to disadvantage our young people even further.Pupils from a number of schools also commented on Mr Weirrsquos announcement.Down High Head Boy Jack Martin, who is from Newcastle, said: ldquoI will be missing at least  weeks of in-school learning this school year alone in addition to the time missed from March last year.ldquoI know many have missed much more. Thus, I agree with the decision to cancel exams as some pupils have been disproportionally disadvantaged.Down High Head Girl Anna Clements, who is from Ballynahinch, said: ldquoI greatly appreciate what the teachers have been going through in these dficult times and I hope this decision eases the pressure on them.ldquoWe have been in a state of limbo since the start of our Upper Sixth Year. What I would appreciate now from external agencies is clarication with regard to how our grades are to be assigned.Assumption Grammar Head Girl Lucia Orsi, from Crossgar, said: ldquoI am relieved that examinations have been cancelled as I feared that our courses would not have been completed in time, due to the current lockdown.ldquoHowever, I am anxious that there has been no decision on how our grades will be calculated..prettyPhoto.jpg\" alt\"\" width\"\" border\"\"  "},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th January 2021 Towns.jpg","title":"Towns could be in line for public realm scheme boost  ","story":"SAINTFIELD, Killyleagh and Castlewellan could be in line for ambitious new public realm and environmental improvement schemes.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is seeking financial support from the Department for Communities to carry out work in each of the locations which could cost several million pounds.Traditionally, the government department provides cash to upgrade towns which have a population in excess of , people, but local authority officials believe that there may be a future opportunity to finance schemes in towns where the population is greater than ,.Members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were told on Mondaythat council officials plan to ask the government department to include the local areas in a capital works forward plan.Councillors were told that in order to inform the capital works forward plan, the council commissioned research in each of the areas, asking people for their views and coming up with short, medium and long term proposals.Reports on the future vision for each area were tabled at Mondayrsquos committee meeting and in addition to detailing what work could take place, they focus on the negative impact of doing nothing.Moving forward, council officials have confirmed that they are to work with their Department for Communities colleagues on a capital works programme for each area.In Killyleagh, suggested improvements include enhancements and improvements to the seafront between Seaview and Cuan Beach, new lighting between Shore Street and Seaview and a new slipway at Seaside Road.Other suggestions include improving the Sir Hans Sloane memorial space and Frederick Street car park and replacing a current public toilet block at the top of High Street in front of Killyleagh Castle,Elsewhere, repainting the townrsquos library is suggested, alongside utilising the top floor of the building for community use, addressing derelict buildings and the introduction of a so-called shopfronts scheme.The recent consultation highlighted the need for improved welcome and directional signage, new pavings and footpaths and support for the Hans Sloane Centre.Similarly in Saintfield there is a focus on upgrading shop fronts alongside new paving and footpaths, resurfacing a section of Main Street, addressing the derelict buildings issue and the provision of a pelican crossing between High Street and the townrsquos new community centre.Additional open spaces are also highlighted with calls for the main car park at Downpatrick Street to be upgraded, alongside the provision of additional spaces.The upgrade of public toilets at the New Line is also highlighted, alongside their potential relocation and steps to tackle a flooding issue between the Fair Green and Main Street.Other suggestions include the need for a ldquospend local campaign which could include the development of a mobile app, allowing shoppers to upload a personal spending balance which could attract discounts when purchases are made in the town.In Castlewellan, issues highlighted include better use of the space around the townrsquos market House at Upper Square, the provision of additional litter bins, better use of vacant and derelict space, enhanced car parking and traffic management and the townrsquos general landscape with flower beds and new trees, particularly at the Lower Square area.Improving signage to direct people to the peace maze at Castlewellan Forest Park and other buildings of interest is suggested..prettyPhoto.jpg\" alt\"\" width\"\" border\"\"  "},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12241667.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It printed a death notice on December , , which was also published in the United Statesthe next day: “Died in this City on the th inst., Capt. James Hoban, aged about  years. Capt. Hoban was by profession an Architect and emigrated to this country, from Ireland, at the close of the American Revolution…He designed and obtained the premium for the President’s House, and both built and rebuilt it. He also superintended the architecture of the Capitol for a considerable time.”Hoban’s first and second designs for the President’s White House have been mentioned on this page before - his original plans in  for its construction, and his second set of drawings for rebuilding it after being burnt down in  by General Robert Ross from Rostrevor!    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

December But Hoban was also responsible for overseeing the construction of the Capital from  until  - the grand setting for today’s Presidential inauguration of Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris - in yet another building torched by Robert Ross! So who was Hoban and whence his forte for the design, building and rebuilding of such historic American edices His death notice on December  and , , attributed in capital letters to ‘A FRIEND’, continued: “In private le Capt. Hoban possessed, in a very high degree, the esteem and confidence of his fellow-citizens. He was hospitable, generous and charitable. In his regard for the just claims and feelings of others, he was scrupulously nice and particular. Such men are blessings to society while they live, and, even after death, instruct by example. His funeral will take place at  o’clock this morning, to which his friends are respectfully invited.”James Hoban was born into a humble Catholic family in a thatched cottage in Callan, County Kilkenny, in . He was the son of Edward Hoban, a tenant farmer, and Martha Bayne, who had four children, James, Joseph, Philip and Ann. \"The Winning Design for the U.S. Capitol, by William Thornton, Supervised by James HobanYoung James displayed a talent for drawing and design in his first job, as a wheelwright and carpenter, so he entered the Royal Dublin Society to study architecture. He was an outstanding student but work was hard to find after he graduated. So he left Ireland for America in , first to Charleston, South Carolina. The young immigrant moved to Philadelphia and set up an architectural practice before ing to Charleston. Here he got some signicant commissions including the South Carolina Statehouse in Charleston, and overseeing the construction of the US Capitol building.Highly regarded, Hoban also taught architecture to young designers. In  he met President George Washington who was impressed with the young Irish designer, particularly with his elegant, Irish Georgian style.\"Rostrevors General Robert Ross torched both Hobans White House and the Capitol BuildingIn July , after an open competition, the President and his advisors chose Hoban’s design for the executive mansion - The White House - inspired by Dublin’s Leinster House.Construction was delayed as there weren’t enough skilled workers to build it and Hoban was asked to redesign it, from three stories to two.Though it wasn’t yet finished President John Adams and his we Abigail moved into the mansion early in November . Apparently they found it ‘too cold’ - probably because it wasn’t completed - but Hoban’s White House was the springboard for other important commissions and he designed many of the capital city’s hotels, government buildings and expensive private residences.After the White House was burned down in  by Rostrevor’s General Robert Ross, Hoban was commissioned to rebuild it, virtually a total redesign as the structure had been almost completely destroyed. Thus the White House was raised, razed and raised again by Irishmen! \"Drawing of North Side of the White House by James Hoban. Circa Hoban’s responsibilities for the Capitol weren’t as straightforward as for the White House. Around ten architects entered a competition in  to design the Capitol, all unsuccessfully. One of the better submissions, by French-trained architect Stephen Hallet, was thought to be too French and too costly!A late entry for the competition, by amateur architect William Thornton, was officially approved in April , and following some high-level diplomacy, Hallet was appointed to review Thornton’s plans, develop cost estimates, and serve as superintendent of construction. But the relationship was tetchy and James Hoban, much acclaimed for his ongoing White House project, was brought in to revise and oversee the design and construction of the Capitol. On September ,  President George Washington laid the cornerstone, and construction proceeded with Hallet working under Hoban. Official records held by the Bureau of Public Buildings and Works in Washington and signed on September ,  show that the building commissioners directed that “Mr. James Hoban take on himself the general super intendency of the Capitol and that the work thereof be conducted agreeable to the orders and directions which may be given from time to time.”So the towering stone setting for today’s inaugurations was supervised, managed and administered by Hoban, with President Biden, Vice-President Harris and their spouses taken afterwards to Hoban’s White House by a special military escort. \"Watercolour View of the Capitol, by William Birch, c.   \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularNI police station closed due to coronavirus outbreakRathlin Island man Rauri on Channel  TV show, Ben Fogle: New Lives in the WildNI road now reopened after fire - residents allowed toto homesSammy Wilson: BBC bias is plain for all to see, so we don’t need a well paid guru to tell us soRuth Dudley Edwards: After TG sanitised Martin McGuinness, now comes a proper biography of the ruthless IRA liarMost PopularPolice and family still appealing for help to find missing -year-oldEconomist: In Ireland we should break free of the European Union as the United Kingdom has successfully doneTeen arrested after couple sustain face and head injuries is released on bailStorm Christoph is NI bound as Met Office issues yellow status weather warningFirst Minister Arlene Foster condemns terrorist attack ‘near my childhood home’ | Continuity IRA ‘could have fired shots at civilian helicopter’ say PSNI as they ask public for patience in ongoing bomb search operation                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-feJyhm sc-iELTvK cSgooN\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlesCoronavirusGetting outMust ReadLocal BuysAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Mr Lewis said that he was not looking at extending the grace period.Later, during an appearance before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, DUP MP Ian Paisley pressed him to invoke Article  of the Northern Ireland Protocol, something which in an emergency can be used to temporarily set aside some of the new checks.However, while Mr Lewis said he would be prepared to do soit was deemed necessary, he made clear that the government has no intention of doing so imminently and that they intend to find solutions within the terms of the protocol.Mr Lewis said there was “a new situation” and “new processes” for moving goods between GB and Northern Ireland, but did not row back his claims that there is no new trade border.He said: “I would encourage businesses to engage with the Trader Support Service– companies which have used that have found it [helps with a] really, really good free flow of goods.“It’s why supermarkets are able to get that good flow of products through – companies like Marks  Spencers have seen a really good flow through and I would encourage companies to sign up to that government-supported and paid for scheme.”However, two weeks ago the News Letter revealed that MS has temporarily withdrawn more than  products from its food stores in Northern Ireland because of the complexity of customs arrangements now necessary to trade with another part of the UK and it has been one of many supermarkets in Northern Ireland which have struggled to keep all of their shelves filled since January .A spokesman for MS told the News Letter that “the vast majority [of items withdrawn earlier this month] are now back in stock in Northern Ireland”.There have also been criticism of the TSS from some of those using the government-funded body to assist with customs paperwork.Labour MP Rachael Maskell put it to Brandon Lewis that the “queues and chaos” at ports contradicted his denial that there is an Irish Sea border and asked him when he could ensure “seamless” access for GB goods into Northern Ireland.Mr Lewis responded: “I’m not quite sure what exactly the honourable lady is referring to because actually what she’s referring to is not happening in Northern Ireland. The queues are not the issue.“There have been reports of empty shelves, which is absolutelytrue. I’ve had Welsh ministers in meetings talking about empty shelves and we all saw, partly as a result of the challenges at Dover just before Christmas due to covid.“There are some issues there have been some issues for parcels and parcel deliveries because the guidance – I fully accept, and I’ve outlined this – was published on December .”:Sam McBride: A week into the Irish Sea border, it is already clear that Northern Ireland will be profoundly reshaped by BrexitSystem for getting supplies to Northern Ireland may be five days from collapse due to Irish Sea border, hauliers warn Michael GoveMS temporarily withdraws hundreds of items from sale in Northern Ireland due to Irish Sea border red tapeTop customs expert admits: New Irish Sea border is ‘cumbersome’ and hugely complex – even for me, with  years experienceIrish Sea border which Secretary of State Brandon Lewis claims doesn’t exist empties shelves and ends business in Northern Ireland——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIN our bridge improvers sessions, we are continuing to deal with opening two bids, playing Benjy Acol.Here is a hand with a big point count that requires careful bidding to reach the right contract.The AuctionNorth has a hand with twenty-three points. So, playing Benjy Acol, North opens two diamonds. This shows at least nine tricks in hand or a balanced twenty-three points plus. It is forcing to game. Her partner, South, with only four points bids two hearts, which asks North, her partner, to show what she has. With a balanced hand North bids two no trumps. South now knows that between them they have more than the magic twenty-five points required to play three no trumps.But hold on a minute, whatNorth has five hearts  Four hearts would then surely be a better contract than three no trumps. So, as with last weekrsquos hand, the correct bid by South is now three clubs - five card puppet Stayman - asking Northshe has a four or five card major. North bids three hearts, showing her five-card heart suit. South now bids four hearts, as she knows that they have eight hearts and at least twenty-seven points between them. This is indeed the best contract, as three no trumps makes, but not so many tricks on a spade lead.The playEast begins with the queen of spades. North as declarer looks carefully at the hand before winning this trick with the king in dummy. She realises that this was the only way to dummy to be able to take the heart finesse. Remember - eight ever nine never is the rule. In other words, with eight cards between you in a suit the percentage play is to take the finesse. But with nine cards between you, the percentage play is usually to play the ace and then the king to try and drop the queen. So, declarer at trick two plays the two of hearts from dummy, playing the jack from her hand to execute the finesse.This wins, as West has the queen. North then plays the ace of hearts followed by the king, removing all the opponentsrsquo trumps. The odds for a   break are good, % in fact. Declarer then plays the king of diamonds from her hand. West holds up his ace of diamonds for two rounds, until declarer has played the king and queen, overtaking the third diamond with his ace. West does this in case declarer has a losing club, which could be discarded on dummyrsquos jack of diamonds.East has played first the three and then the five of diamonds, indicating he has three cards in that suit. We will see next week how he would have played his diamondshe had four cards in this suit, using what is known as a Peter. West then plays his ace of clubs, and it is all over, North winning the rest of tricks with the ace of spades, the remaining trumps, and the king and queen of clubs. So, she makes her contract of four spades with an overtrick,  tricks in all ndash two spades, five hearts, two diamonds and two clubs.Well bid and well played. Without the use of puppet Stayman North would probably play in three no trumps. On the lead of the queen of spades this only makes nine tricks - two spades, five hearts and two diamonds. Declarer takes the heart finesse and plays all her hearts. Then, she plays the king and queen of diamonds, West winning the third diamond with his ace, having refused to take the king or queen. West would thenthe ten of spades, which would be won by declarerrsquos ace. But when she plays the king of clubs, West pounces with his ace and plays the nine of spades, which wins, followed by Westrsquos last spade won by Eastrsquos queen, East West making four tricks ndash two spades and two aces, East having to discard one of his spades on the preceding tricks.What have we learnt . As we saw last week, five card Puppet Stayman, after the opening bidder has shown a strong two no trumps, is vitalyou are to find either a   of   fit in one of the majors. lsquoPuppetrsquo has sunk into bridge jargon over the past forty-five years. The convention was originally invented by Neil Silverman and developed in the s by Kit Woolsey and Steve Robinson, all American players. As well as finding a   fit in a major, -card puppet Stayman has the advantage that,there is a   fit, the person with the strong hand plays the contract, and the lead comes up to him.. Always take care to take the first trick in the right handyou want to take a finesse.. Sometimes it is advisable to hold up an ace, particularly in no trumps, to block your opponents from entering the hand with winners in it.Penarth club newsPeter Sampsonrsquos ladder competition continues.

Part of their new multi-disciplinary model is still in place - where not just GPs are working under the same roof, but pharmacists and physios too. But rather than them coming to the surgery initially, it is via telephone.Dr Kristina Leppik, Dr Quarratul-Ain Yousef, Mrs Kerry Anne-CarterIf it is apparent from the call that they need to come in for a face-to-face, that will be organised. Those that are called in, must follow a one-way-system through the surgery and will have their temperature taken upon arrival.Dr Kristina Leppik, who works at the surgery, said she was apprehensive about this new way of working at first, wonderingGPs would be able to assess patients properly over the phone. But due to prior training in telephone consultations, the transition was smooth and easier than initially thought.On Monday, December , work began on rolling out the Oxford AZ vaccine in the area to patients over . Staff had to make sure that everyone was ready and prepared for this important task, and even took into consideration those that have worries about entering a GP now.Dr Quarratul-Ain Yousef, who moved to the area from Birmingham not long before lockdown began, said the staff have been ldquoquite proactive in trying to adapt by creating an outside pod with a clear shelter ndash which cannot be seen through easily - where people coming in for a vaccine or routine B jab can have it done rather than going insidethey choose.ldquoWersquove reduced risk to our staff, the patients coming in, and reduced risks to patients.ldquoThe initial reason for the shelter was because we thought, well, winter is coming, and people are going to have coughs.ldquoWe might need to listen to them, and instead of bringing them in, how do we assess such a high risk in a safe and confidential manner ldquoWe give them the option, and most people have been fine. And itrsquos been quite nice to feel a bit more relaxed because itrsquos an open environment.As soon as the staff are aware of the amount of stock that they will be getting from the health board, they can organise the clinics.ldquoWe have to factor in the spacing, itrsquos a new vaccine so people might have questions which we are always happy to answer.ldquoSo far itrsquos going pretty well.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
