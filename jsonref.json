Barrett in these pictures, snapped by artist and photographer Skyler Brown          Above: the boat in its heyday. The Mamie S. Barrett is a steel-hulled sternwheel river towboat constructed with scow bow and steam engine rig. It was built in 1921 by the Howard Brothers of Jeffersonville, IndianaThose luxurious touches are long gone, however, as this one-time-gem, a steam-powered towboat built in 1921, lies rotting after being abandoned at Deer Park, Louisiana, 10 miles from the Mississippi.Haunting pictures show the flaking walls of the interior with the remnants of a kitchen area still visible, doors hanging off their hinges and ceilings falling down.Other striking shots show the rusting exterior of the once-proud boat as it lies beached upon a green bank.          Debris covers the floor of the Mamie S. Barrett, a steamboat which was bought by the US Army Corps of Engineers in late 1923. The Barrett was designed to accommodate a crew of 11 officers and 27 men          Above: peeling walls and decaying walls are evident inside the once-proud boat, which was ravaged by fire last year. It enjoyed a long and varied career on the inland river system, and underwent numerous modifications since its launching in 1921          It\u0027s not clear whether some of the equipment which can still be seen inside the decaying boat was originally part of the vessel, or has been dumped inside it, since it was left to deteriorate 10 miles from the Mississippi RiverIt would take a mammoth amount of money to restore this historic steamboat, which has notched up close to 100 years, to its former luxurious condition.Originally named the Mamie S. Barrett, the US Army Corps of Engineers bought the steamboat in late 1923, two years after the 124-foot-long boat had been constructed at a cost of $145,000 (£108,000) at the Howard Shipyard in Jeffersonville, Indiana.The vessel was used by the Army Corps for 24 years, to cruise inland waters. President Franklin D. Roosevelt would have known it as the Penniman, as it was renamed in 1935.          Under foliage, the former towboat and floating restaurant lies abandoned on the shore. In the 1950s the second deck was partially enclosed with wood panels and jalousie windows          Peeling paint can be seen on the walls of the boat, which is also being overtaken by weeds at Deer Park, Louisiana. In 1981 the entire hull was filled with special foam to prevent further deterioration of the vessel. Estimates around that time indicated that over $725,000 would be needed to rehabilitate the Barrett into a first class restaurant and boutiqueIn 1942, the commander in chief inspected certain strategic industrial and military sites related to the war effort via the Mississippi River. But information on these trips, which included a visit to Camp Shelby, was not publicized at the time, for security reasons. It also was employed as a towboat for hauling rock and lumber to sites for revetment work. In 1945 the Barrett carried a group of important officials and dignitaries on an inspection tour of the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and Cairo.          The floor is pocked with holes as the elements continue to take a toll on the derelict boat. The Mamie S. Barrett, built in 1921 as the flagship vessel for the Barrett Towboat and Barge Line Company, is significant as a rare surviving form of riverboat transportation and for its historical association with the Howard Brothers Ship Yards of Jeffersonville, Indiana          During the vessel\u0027s relatively long period of service on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers (1921-1949), riverboat transportation and technology underwent a period of great transition, passing from the age of steam powered sternwheelers into the modern era of propeller driven, diesel powered vesselsAnd before it was dumped on the shore and left to decay over 30 years ago, the vessel underwent various conversions.The Barrett has been a floating clubhouse, restaurant and, during the 1980s, a showboat with a 120-seat theater on the main deck. The boat, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, was bought to be used as a casino boat three decades ago. But that never eventuated, reports steamboats.org.In the 1990s, having survived two floods, the boat was donated to the town of Rosedale, but it had no use for the vessel.          Although a substantial number of sternwheelers had been built during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, very few still survive          The Mamie S. Barrett was launched at the Howard Yards on August 11, 1921, making her maiden voyage to Cincinnati two weeks later in tow of the J. D. LanePlans to restore it have failed to materialize and last year, when the Mississippi River rose to the area it had been left to rot, the Mamie S. Barrett caught fire and was mostly destroyed.Documenting changes since that fire in a haunting series of photos, artist and photographer Skyler Brown, of Sacramento, California, said he was drawn to the vessel after \u0027hearing rumors of a large abandoned steamboat somewhere along the Mississippi River.\u0027\u0027I\u0027ve been documenting abandoned locations around the world for several years now,\u0027 he added.Traffic warden gives ticket to smashed car waiting for tow truckSNP\u0027s Westminster leader Ian Blackford suspended from the CommonsTerror as rollercoaster derails: Firefighters work to rescue ridersPeople e for cover after strong winds send portaloos flyingA look into the relationship between Emmanuel and BrigittePolls have closed and counting begins in Lewisham East by-electionKyle Yule murderers caught chasing men with knives and beltsHeroic builders chase young joyriders out of stolen car in BristolMerkel receives pressure to toughen Germany\u0027s border policyRussia World Cup security tightens as army trucks are deployedHolidaymakers watch in horror as shark swims close to beachThe Queen shows Meghan the royal ropes as they arrive in Cheshire    The Barrett and other sternwheel towboats such as the Loretta Howard, long considered the standard of the period, were two of only 17 sternwheel towboats built at the Howard Yards after 1920          As a result of the Depression, the Barrett Line sold the towboat in 1937 to the Army Corps of Engineers Office in Florence, Alabama. The Barrett was transferred to the St. Louis District and renamed the motor vessel Penniman, in honor of William H. Penniman, an employee of the St. Louis Office from 1891 to 1934          In 1945 the Barrett carried a group of important officials and dignitaries on an inspection tour of the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and Cairo\u0027Any time I travel somewhere I research the region beforehand to find forgotten locations that are off the beaten path. \u0027There wasn\u0027t much information online about the boat or its location, but after scouring satellite imagery I found what I suspected was the boat. I still wasn\u0027t sure that it really existed though until I arrived and saw it in person.   \u0027Before I start taking pictures at an abandoned location I always survey the site first, both to find the best angles and to make sure it\u0027s safe to enter,\u0027 Brown said.Ship carrying 900 migrants docks in Sicily as Italy fights...Saudi-led alliance launches the biggest assault of Yemen\u0027s...Fleet of fancy!

In 2016, she announced her reelection bid and said that her priorities were affordable housing as well as environmental health and public transport.After the death of Mayor Ed Lee, London Breed became the acting mayor by virtue of her role as President of the Board of Supervisors. In 2018, Mark Farrell was selected to serve in the interim until the election.          London Breed campaigns with Senator Scott Weiner in downtown San Francisco, CaliforniaLondon Breed mayorDuring a time in which African-Americans are becoming increasingly scarce in the US city, London Breed was declared the winner of the race to become mayor of San Francisco.After eight days of counting, Breed built up a lead in the 250,000 ballots that were tallied and won by 2,177 votes, with only 6,700 left to count.After her win, London revealed that her election sends a message to San Francisco’s youth, especially to those, like herself, are growing up poor.‘No matter where you come from, no matter what you decide to do in life, you can do anything you want to do. Never let your circumstances determine your outcome in life,’ Breed said.She will take office next month and will also be the second woman to be elected mayor in the history of San Francisco, after US Senator Dianne Feinstein. Breed has vowed to represent all of the city and lead the parts that are economically thriving but mired in homelessness and unaffordable homes.London also said that she would get rid of the homeless tent camps within a year of taking office, before she will need to run in November 2019 after completing Ed Lee’s term, which ends in early 2020.The city has an unusual ranked choice voting system that allows voter to pick their top three candidates for mayor. This means that as votes are being counted, second-place and third-place choices are also tallied.Ahead of the election, Mark Leno and Jane Kim asked supporters to pick the other as their second choice in order to block London Breed from winning entirely, saying that she represented what had made San Francisco so inequitable, despite all being Democrats.          Former state Senator Mark Leno speaks to reporters in San Francisco ahead of the electionThis portrayal as a lackey for big business affected Breed and she said: ‘I ask people to not attribute what I\u0027ve done — my success and how hard I\u0027ve worked — to not reduce that or attribute that to someone else,’ Breed told the AP in a pre-election interview.At City Hall, she paid homage to her late grandmother and said she probably had a hand in her win. ‘She took care of the community, she took care of me even on days when I didn\u0027t deserve it, and so being here in her honor means so much,’ she said.World Cup 2018 Day 2: Google Doodle celebrates Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Uruguay, Iran and Morocco teamsPortugal vs Spain: Kick off time, squads and how to watch on TVWho is Cooke Maroney?

It settled the matter out of court.James Pink, expert medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Donna, said: \u0027Donna had undergone counselling at the request of the Hospital Trust to prepare psychologically for double mastectomy so was incredibly shocked and upset to come out of surgery with implants she had not consented to.\u0027This was already a distressing time and this just compounded her problems.\u0027The NHS had shown care and compassion in helping Donna prepare for her surgery. However, what was meant to be an operation designed to reduce the risk of Donna being diagnosed with breast cancer ended up causing her much unnecessary distress and suffering.\u0027We now call on the NHS Trust to ensure it learns lessons from Donna\u0027s case and realises the importance of ensuring policies and checks surrounding patient consent are upheld at all times.\u0027A spokeswoman for Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: \u0027We were given consent by the patient for implants in 2014, we did not act negligently and the case was settled in 2016.\u0027We have clear and effective consent processes that are followed across the Trust, which outline the risks that patients may face during and after any surgery, including the common risk of blood clots.

Orbán\u0027s government has proposed legislation which would criminalise the act of helping asylum-seekers\u0027We do what we have to do, we are not criminals,\u0027 she said.The government says the laws are aimed at persons helping undeserving migrants to acquire refugee status, for example if those persons were not in immediate danger before entering Hungary, or who entered the country illegally.Named after the liberal Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, the measures are the government\u0027s latest broadside against the 87-year-old, who has long been accused by the fiercely anti-immigration Orbán of facilitating migration into Europe.The run-up to a parliamentary election in April, which Orbán\u0027s ruling Fidesz party won by a landslide, was dominated by anti-migrant and anti-Soros messaging on pro-government media.After the vote, Orbán vowed to clampdown on NGOs, whose staff he called \u0027Soros mercenaries\u0027.According to Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a group providing free legal aid to asylum-seekers, Stop Soros is meant \u0027to stigmatise, intimidate, and sanction human rights defenders\u0027 work\u0027.The measures are \u0027unacceptable,..and should have no place in a democratic country that is run by the rule-of-law\u0027, Pardavi told the press conference.The UNHCR refugee agency has also called on the government to withdraw the plans.They \u0027would significantly restrict the ability of NGOs and iniduals to support asylum-seekers and refugees\u0027, it said in a statement.The EU\u0027s rights watchdog, the Venice Commission, has also begun a probe into the laws\u0027 compliance with EU values, and is due to give its opinion later in June.The NGOs have pledged to use all legal means to challenge the legislation, depending on the final version approved by parliament, including bringing cases before the Hungarian constitutional court and the EU courts. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/15/05F8B1B1000003E8-5844203-image-a-47_1528986748265.jpg","title":"Who Jack Brooksbank Princess Eugenies fiance revealed ahead Royal Wedding","story":"    Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank pose in the Picture Gallery at Buckingham PalaceWho is Jack Brooksbank?Born May 3, 1986 and once nicknamed ‘barman Jack’, Princess Eugenie’s husband-to-be has worked his way up through some of London’s bars and nightspots, after spurning university and embarking on a career in the hospitality business.Despite being known as a party animal, Jack Brooksbank has put his best foot forward when it comes to entrepreneurship and set up a wine merchants business.

Jack Brooksbank and Princess Eugenie of York attend Tracey Emin\u0027s birthday partyBrooksbank was also said to be a stabilising influence on Eugenie, once considered a ‘party princess’ and they have both cut down on clubbing as they have grown older. After getting to know the business, Jack became a brand ambassador for Clooney’s Casamigos tequila.This move was considered to be tactical and to make him seem more respectable ahead of his potential welcome into the Royal Family. Jack also said that he intended to open a chain of pubs and hostelries.In 2013, he said: \u0027I want to create a chain of pubs. It has been my dream since I was 18. I have fond memories of Sunday roasts in pubs with log fires, and it’s something I want to recreate.

She looks at me ( gives a disgusted face), and ran in the house. I thought, Maybe she don\u0027t want to be bothered today,\u0027 said Haddish (Barr with Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman on the Roseanne set)Barr\u0027s co-star and the show\u0027s executive producer Sara Gilbert denounced her on social media in the wake of her remarks.\u0027Roseanne\u0027s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least,\u0027 wrote Gilbert.\u0027This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we\u0027ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.\u0027\u0027Wow! unreal,\u0027 wrote Barr, who had confessed in earlier interviews to the difficult job Gilbert had of trying to rein in her impulse to tweet offensive comments.However, she later followed up, tweeting: \u0027No, I understand her position and why she said what she said. i forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f***ed up.\u0027She reiterated this soon after when a follower criticized Gilbert, saying: \u0027She\u0027s distancing herself from me and my tweet-she has to.\u0027 Gilbert\u0027s on-screen brother did not get off so easy. Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show and started working with Barr when he was just six, was the first to feel the wrath of the show\u0027s creator after he released a statement criticizing her racist tweet saying Jarrett looks like the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027I condemn these statements vehemently,\u0027 wrote Fishman, who is the father of a black daughter in the reboot.\u0027They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society. I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter: \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027  Barr seemed to have made amends with both Gilbert and Fishman after a few days however, writing:  \u0027To michael fishman and sara gilbert: I forgive u both, love u both, just wish u could have called me personally 2 talk rather than do it in a public arena. I understand, tho. It\u0027s ok.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/16/21F57D6900000578-5844815-image-a-66_1528991076076.jpg","title":"When Eid al Fitr 2018 celebrate UK","story":"    Egyptians try to catch balloons distributed for free marking Eid outside a mosque in CairoWhat is Eid al-Fitr?Eid al-Fitr, known as the feast that breaks the fast of Ramadan, is the first and only day of the new month called Shawwal when Muslims are not permitted to fast.Ramadan, one of the Five Pillars of Islam which lasts between 29 and 30 days, is based on when a new moon is sighted by local religious authorities. When the crescent moon is seen, Eid can begin.Considered one of the most important holidays of the Islamic calendar, Eid has its own particular set of prayers that can only be recited in congregation and often called out in parks, community centres or mosques called the Salat al-Eid.          Iranian men perform the Eid prayers at Tehran University to mark on the religious festivalWhen is Eid al Fitr 2018?Due to the dates of Ramadan varying from one year to another on the Gregorian calendar, Eid is also on a different day each year because it is determined by the lunar calendar.In 2018, Eid al-Fitr will take place on Friday, June 15 after the crescent moon is seen on the evening of June 14 in Saudi Arabia.The time in Saudi Arabia is three hours later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and at present, there is a two hour difference between the UK and Riyadh because of British Summer Time (BST).This means that as sunset is predicted for 6.43pm this evening, this would be 4:43pm in Britain. But as astronomers have predicted that the moon will not be visible until the next day, Eid al-Fitr will officially begin on Friday.Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court has requested for Muslims to keep an eye out for the crescent moon and report it to authorities as many Islamic scholars insist on it being visible with the naked eye.          Pakistani worshippers hold prayers for Eid in the Lahore King\u0027s Mosque for the religious festivalHow to celebrate Eid in the UKEvery year, Eid al-Fitr is a big celebration with the Salat al-Eid being recited. Muslims will gather at mosques or open-air areas to pray on the first morning before eating breakfast with their family and friends, their first meal in daylight in over a month.Events will also be held in London’s Trafalgar Square and Birmingham’s Small Heath Park to mark the start of the new month.Muslims also honour Eid by giving to charity and this is referred to as Zakat al-Fitr. Donations will be given to those who are not able to join in the feast and celebrate the breaking of the fast.World Cup 2018 Day 2: Google Doodle celebrates Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Uruguay, Iran and Morocco teamsPortugal vs Spain: Kick off time, squads and how to watch on TVWho is Cooke Maroney?

The film follows the prophet Muhammad and the beginning of the Islamic religion in Mecca.The Message depicts when the first Muslims were persecuted and shows their exodus to Medina, after Muhammad was warned of an assassination plot against him before ending with their triumphant return to Mecca.It was made in English with Anthony Quinn and Irene Papas as the main characters and in Arabic, with leading Arab stars Abdullah Gheith and Mouna Wasef from Egypt and Syria respectively.          The Message will be the first Arabic film to get a commercial screening in Riyadh (pictured)Why was The Message banned?The Message was banned in many Muslim-majority countries and in the US, its release in cinemas was suspended after members of an extremist group called the Hanafi movement staged a siege in Washington DC.The group took a number of hostages and killed two people because they thought  Anthony Quinn had played the character of Muhammad in the film. In addition to this, because images of Muhammad are strictly forbidden in Islam, The Message was criticised by conservative Muslims.However, the director Moustapha Akkad was aware of this and produced an epic where Muhammad was never seen or heard. In 2018, more than 40 years after the ban, the Saudi censorship board have cleared it to be screened in 4K in time for Eid celebrations.With both versions being cleared, The Message will be screened by producer Trancas Entertainment and distributor Front Row in the VOX Riyadh Park multiplex in the Saudi capital.

However, the blue tick seems to have disappeared overnight.The controversial tweet may have caused the social network to follow their guidelines, which say that the social media platform will remove verification of anyone that is ‘promoting hate andor violence against, or directly attacking or threatening other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease among other reasons’.A Twitter spokesperson told the Daily Caller that the company does not comment on inidual accounts for ‘privacy and security reasons’.The ‘Satanic Jew’ tweets are not the first time Farrakhan sparked accusations of anti-semitism.In 1984, he described Judaism as a ‘gutter religion’ and branded supporters of Israel as criminals.He once said that \u0027the Jews don\u0027t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that\u0027s a good name. Hitler was a very great man\u0027.When speaking about Hezbollah, he said: \u0027They call them terrorists, I call them freedom fighters.\u0027Here is all you need to know about Louis Farrakhan including his wife, children, net worth and Nation of Islam.Who is Louis Farrakhan?Louis Farrakhan is the leader of the Nation of Islam, the American religious group.Born in New York on May 11, 1933 as Louis Eugene Walcott, Farrakhan initially trained as a teacher and a nightclub singer.He won a track scholarship to college in North Carolina and was a talented classical violinist, having first started playing the instrument at the age of 5.In 1955, the religious and political figure Malcolm X persuaded Farrakhan to join the Nation of Islam. Upon joining, Farrakhan dropped his last name and became Louis X. He later became Abdul Haleem Farrakhan, and ultimately Louis Farrakhan.At the beginning of the sixties, a rift formed between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam leader, Elijah Muhammad.In 1964, Farrakhan criticised Malcolm X in the NOI newspaper saying: ‘The die is set and Malcolm shall not escape... such a man is worthy of death.’The following February, Malcolm X was assassinated and Farrakhan became the NOI spokesman.By the late 1970s, Farrakhan was the head of the Nation of Islam, becoming a highly influential figure on the political landscape during the 1980s.In 1984, Farrakhan supported Jesse Jackson’s presidential bid, and subsequently threatened the Washington Post reporter that reported the story about Jesse Jackson using anti-Semitic language in private.          Farrakhan tweeted a link to his May sermon about Harvey Weinstein that was called \u0027Thoroughly and completely unmasking the Satanic Jew and the Synagogue of Satan\u0027The following year he accepted a $5 million interest-free loan from Muammar Gaddafi.In 1986, Farrakhan sued Ronald Reagan over the Libya sanctions and was banned from entering the UK.In 1991, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which returned again in 1999. He had surgery in 2001 and again in 2007.In 1995, Farrakhan was in the news for organising the ‘Million Man March’ to Washington DC. Hundreds of thousands of black men marched and pledged to remain committed to their families and communities.Louis Farrakhan’s wife and childrenFarrakhan married Betsy Walcott, nee Ross, in 1953 and the couple had nine children. Betsy subsequently changed her name to Khadijah Farrakhan.          Farrakhan organised the 1995 Million Man March as well as the Million Family March in 2000The couple’s oldest son, Louis Farrakhan Jr, was reported dead by the Nation of Islam on June 4, 2018. The statement from the organisation said the 60-year-old had a heart condition and died peacefully in his sleep.What is Louis Farrakhan’s net worth?Louis Farrakhan’s net worth is estimated to be $3 million (£2.2m), according to Celebrity Net Worth.What is the Nation of Islam?The Nation of Islam is a religious and political movement that started in the early 1930s by W.D. Fard Muhammad. Muhammad’s goal was, according to the Nation of Islam website, ‘to teach the downtrodden and defenseless Black people a thorough Knowledge of God and of themselves, and to put them on the road to Self-Independence with a superior culture and higher civilization than they had previously experienced.’Muhammad reportedly disappeared in 1934, and his disciple Elijah Muhammad took over. The organisation rose to prominence when Malcolm Little, later to be Malcolm X, joined, with its numbers swelling to tens of thousands by the 1970s. Muhammad Ali was one of its most famous members.World Cup 2018 Day 2: Google Doodle celebrates Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Uruguay, Iran and Morocco teamsPortugal vs Spain: Kick off time, squads and how to watch on TVWho is Cooke Maroney?

Maybe he\u0027ll want children.\u0027Ms Bourdel replied: \u0027So, Brigitte, you\u0027re happy with him, choose happiness!\u0027The exchange was recounted in a new France 3 TV documentary called \u0027Brigitte Macron: A French Novel\u0027.The film marks the first time the family have spoken out about the romance that blossomed after Macron began seeing his drama teacher.He was in her literature class and attending the theatre workshop she ran at a Catholic high school in Amiens.In his book and political manifesto Revolution, President Macron described the affair as \u0027a love often clandestine, often hidden, misunderstood by many before imposing itself.\u0027 The Macrons ended up getting married in the Channel beach resort of Le Touquet in 2007, but not before causing extreme angst among those closest to them.Mrs Macron\u0027s youngest daughter, Tiphaine Auzière, 34, told the documentary she was just nine when she learned of the affair.

When they are together, it\u0027s almost as if the world does not exist.\u0027In other recent media interviews, Ms Auzière has called her mother a \u0027remarkable warrior\u0027, who gave Mr Macron a great deal of confidence.As his teacher she used to stand off stage and tell him \u0027to raise his voice\u0027, for example, said Ms Auzière.She added: \u0027I had parents who did things intelligently things were done gradually.\u0027My dad and my mummy always took care to protect us, to not expose us and to manage things properly so that we suffered as little as possible.\u0027My dad worked in Lille during the week and, I was with my mom when she went to see Emmanuel.\u0027Mr Macron has since admitted that the young children of Tiphanie and her sister and brother are \u0027enough\u0027 for him, and he does not regret not having any of his own.Mrs Macron would not be interviewed for the documentary, but is said to have sanctioned close friends and family talking about her.She is quoted in the film as saying: \u0027I know that I hurt my children and it\u0027s the thing for which I most reproach myself but if I hadn\u0027t made that choice I would have missed out on my life.\u0027Mrs Macron suffered a great deal of criticism in Amiens, where her family owned a chain of bakeries.In a macabre twist, the documentary compared the Macron affair to the case of Gabrielle Russier, a teacher in Marseilles who committed suicide in 1969 after being convicted of seducing a 16-year-old in her class. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/19/4D3C515000000578-0-Niklas_Weber_s_p_hen_we_arrived_at_the_rio_tarcoles_in_costa_ric-a-5_1528999211582.jpg","title":"The stunning images featured National Geographics Travel Photographer Year contest","story":"    Paul Tsui\u0027s picture of a quiet street in Macau, a city in southeast China which is rapidly changing          Niklas Weber\u0027s picture of a group of  sharp-mouthed crocodiles in Costa Rica which he captured using a drone.

The Queen and Meghan dropped in to see schoolchildren at the Storyhouse building in Chester, but at first the youngsters didn\u0027t seem to notice the visitors had arrived          Getting on famously! The Queen and the Duchess of Sussex shared a joke as they watched a ceremony to open the new Mersey Gateway Bridge during their first official engagement togetherWhat is all the more remarkable is that it should have happened so quickly. Since her wedding on May 19, Meghan has seen the Queen only once – at last Saturday\u0027s Trooping the Colour.While she and Harry have been on honeymoon – said to have been to Canada – the Queen has also been away, to Craigowan Lodge at Balmoral.Royal aides had been thinking about a joint visit involving the monarch and Meghan but it was the Queen herself who suggested it should be sooner rather than later.Meghan\u0027s bond with Her Majesty! Harry\u0027s bride shows her...The Queen\u0027s tribute to Grenfell: Her Majesty observes...Share this articleThe Duchess of Cambridge had been married almost a year before being invited to accompany the Queen, at the start of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 for a day in Leicester.Some will doubtless wonder if this early invitation for Meghan reflects some sort of favouritism. I understand the decision was taken because it was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton did.   Growing confidence! Meghan seemed completely at ease as she chatted with the monarch          The Duchess of Sussex looked animated as she chatted during her first official engagement with the Queen          It was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton (left) did\u0027Remember, unlike Kate she doesn\u0027t have a family to fall back on here,\u0027 said an insider.Indeed, it was noticeable how nervous Meghan appeared as she joined the carriage drive last Saturday.\u0027The Queen\u0027s thinking is simple, she wants to put her at her ease,\u0027 says one of her staff.When the invitation arrived, officials assumed Harry would be included too. Instead, it was made clear this was to be a visit for just the two women.Intriguingly, the programme was not especially designed for Meghan – as it was when the Queen took Kate to Leicester where the two sat through a fashion show. In fact it was deliberately planned as a day of typical royal events that would give Meghan a better grounding in the royal routine.\u0027Nothing too starry, lots of handshaking and meeting of local worthies,\u0027 as one insider puts it.    A sudden gust of wind made Meghan’s decision not to wear a hat on her first official engagement with the Queen rather noticeableSo a message was sent to the Queen’s private office asking what the sovereign intended to wear. The answer included mention of the hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan, which some would have taken as a suggestion for Meghan to do the same.But after some discussion, it was agreed between Buckingham and Kensington Palaces that the duchess would let her brunette locks flow free.                        So much has happened to Meghan since her wedding day: Nottingham Cottage where she and Harry live at Kensington Palace has been redecorated and the couple have spent time at their new country bolthole in Oxfordshire.Nevertheless, it is not difficult to imagine how the duchess must have been feeling as she arrived at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening.Whenever the Queen takes the Royal Train there is a protocol to be observed. She dines first at home and then she travels to the station, on this occasion Euston.Meghan, too, had already had supper and the two women were driven together at 10.45pm along with a handful of senior staff. Domestic staff, including footmen, stewards and a dresser, had gone ahead.Once on board the train it is understood the Queen was keen to turn in. She doesn\u0027t like eating late but she did want to ensure that Meghan was comfortable.It must have been an eye-opening experience for the American-born duchess. There are no showers on the train, but full-size baths.   The pair shared a joke during the opening ceremony, showing how a bond is clearly developing between the two women  The Queen looked in great spirits as she began her day out with Harry\u0027s new wife and the pair showed their lighthearted bond as they laughed together during an opening ceremony for the new Mersey Gateway Bridge  The Queen and Meghan were all smiles as they left Chester Town Hall, with both women carrying pretty bouquets of flowers It is thought that Meghan was provided with Prince Philip\u0027s saloon which includes a bedroom, bathroom and sitting room.By the time the train and its royal passengers arrived at Runcorn, Cheshire, yesterday morning after breakfast, Meghan and the Queen had spoken about the day ahead.That much was clear as they exchanged several observations during the ceremony to mark the opening of the Mersey Gateway Bridge.By the time she had watched the Queen unveil two plaques, completed a walkabout, attended a civic lunch and accepted numerous posies, her early stiffness had gone and she began to relax.Next week\u0027s carriage drive at Royal Ascot should be breeze. And next month sees an event where it\u0027s just possible that the Queen will be turning to the newest member of the family for help – the arrival in London of Meghan\u0027s fellow American, US President Donald Trump.          While the Queen was vibrant in green, Meghan opted for a more pared back look in an elegant cream dress with a cape detail around the shoulders "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/23/4D38933D00000578-0-image-m-40_1529016619486.jpg","title":"Gust wind proves hair raising Meghan official engagement Queen","story":"    A sudden gust of wind made Meghan\u0027s decision not to wear a hat on her first official engagement with the Queen rather noticeableSo a message was sent to the Queen\u0027s private office asking what the sovereign intended to wear. The answer included mention of the hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan, which some would have taken as a suggestion for Meghan to do the same.But after some discussion, it was agreed between Buckingham and Kensington Palaces that the duchess would let her brunette locks flow free.RICHARD KAY: How the Queen insisted that Harry was not...The Queen\u0027s tribute to Grenfell: Her Majesty observes...Share this articleOn the other hand, Meghan\u0027s figure-hugging Givenchy dress was a \u0027show of respect\u0027 for the Queen, fashion commentator Lucas Armitage said.The Duchess of Sussex opted for a \u0027regal\u0027 monochrome number as she joined the Queen for their first official joint engagement in Cheshire on Thursday, proving herself an \u0027exemplary royal\u0027, he said.The custom-designed number, which fell to just below the knee, featured a thin belted waist and was paired with a sensible black clutch and pumps - and sheer tights.

Orbán\u0027s government has proposed legislation which would criminalise the act of helping asylum-seekers\u0027We do what we have to do, we are not criminals,\u0027 she said.The government says the laws are aimed at persons helping undeserving migrants to acquire refugee status, for example if those persons were not in immediate danger before entering Hungary, or who entered the country illegally.Named after the liberal Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, the measures are the government\u0027s latest broadside against the 87-year-old, who has long been accused by the fiercely anti-immigration Orbán of facilitating migration into Europe.The run-up to a parliamentary election in April, which Orbán\u0027s ruling Fidesz party won by a landslide, was dominated by anti-migrant and anti-Soros messaging on pro-government media.After the vote, Orbán vowed to clampdown on NGOs, whose staff he called \u0027Soros mercenaries\u0027.According to Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a group providing free legal aid to asylum-seekers, Stop Soros is meant \u0027to stigmatise, intimidate, and sanction human rights defenders\u0027 work\u0027.The measures are \u0027unacceptable,..and should have no place in a democratic country that is run by the rule-of-law\u0027, Pardavi told the press conference.The UNHCR refugee agency has also called on the government to withdraw the plans.They \u0027would significantly restrict the ability of NGOs and iniduals to support asylum-seekers and refugees\u0027, it said in a statement.The EU\u0027s rights watchdog, the Venice Commission, has also begun a probe into the laws\u0027 compliance with EU values, and is due to give its opinion later in June.The NGOs have pledged to use all legal means to challenge the legislation, depending on the final version approved by parliament, including bringing cases before the Hungarian constitutional court and the EU courts. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/18/4D3C5F7F00000578-5844955-image-m-11_1528996539665.jpg","title":"Spooky footage captures fridge washing machine open own","story":"    In the spooky footage recorded after midnight late last night and yesterday night, Paul\u0027s kitchen can be seen          Then, without warning, both appliances open just seconds after one another\u0027My partner and I have noticed strange activity in a certain part of our flat\u0027s kitchen.

When they are together, it\u0027s almost as if the world does not exist.\u0027In other recent media interviews, Ms Auzière has called her mother a \u0027remarkable warrior\u0027, who gave Mr Macron a great deal of confidence.As his teacher she used to stand off stage and tell him \u0027to raise his voice\u0027, for example, said Ms Auzière.She added: \u0027I had parents who did things intelligently things were done gradually.\u0027My dad and my mummy always took care to protect us, to not expose us and to manage things properly so that we suffered as little as possible.\u0027My dad worked in Lille during the week and, I was with my mom when she went to see Emmanuel.\u0027Mr Macron has since admitted that the young children of Tiphanie and her sister and brother are \u0027enough\u0027 for him, and he does not regret not having any of his own.Mrs Macron would not be interviewed for the documentary, but is said to have sanctioned close friends and family talking about her.She is quoted in the film as saying: \u0027I know that I hurt my children and it\u0027s the thing for which I most reproach myself but if I hadn\u0027t made that choice I would have missed out on my life.\u0027Mrs Macron suffered a great deal of criticism in Amiens, where her family owned a chain of bakeries.In a macabre twist, the documentary compared the Macron affair to the case of Gabrielle Russier, a teacher in Marseilles who committed suicide in 1969 after being convicted of seducing a 16-year-old in her class. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/19/4D3C515000000578-0-Niklas_Weber_s_p_hen_we_arrived_at_the_rio_tarcoles_in_costa_ric-a-5_1528999211582.jpg","title":"The stunning images featured National Geographics Travel Photographer Year contest","story":"    Paul Tsui\u0027s picture of a quiet street in Macau, a city in southeast China which is rapidly changing          Niklas Weber\u0027s picture of a group of  sharp-mouthed crocodiles in Costa Rica which he captured using a drone.

The Queen and Meghan dropped in to see schoolchildren at the Storyhouse building in Chester, but at first the youngsters didn\u0027t seem to notice the visitors had arrived          Getting on famously! The Queen and the Duchess of Sussex shared a joke as they watched a ceremony to open the new Mersey Gateway Bridge during their first official engagement togetherWhat is all the more remarkable is that it should have happened so quickly. Since her wedding on May 19, Meghan has seen the Queen only once – at last Saturday\u0027s Trooping the Colour.While she and Harry have been on honeymoon – said to have been to Canada – the Queen has also been away, to Craigowan Lodge at Balmoral.Royal aides had been thinking about a joint visit involving the monarch and Meghan but it was the Queen herself who suggested it should be sooner rather than later.Meghan\u0027s bond with Her Majesty! Harry\u0027s bride shows her...The Queen\u0027s tribute to Grenfell: Her Majesty observes...Share this articleThe Duchess of Cambridge had been married almost a year before being invited to accompany the Queen, at the start of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 for a day in Leicester.Some will doubtless wonder if this early invitation for Meghan reflects some sort of favouritism. I understand the decision was taken because it was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton did.   Growing confidence! Meghan seemed completely at ease as she chatted with the monarch          The Duchess of Sussex looked animated as she chatted during her first official engagement with the Queen          It was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton (left) did\u0027Remember, unlike Kate she doesn\u0027t have a family to fall back on here,\u0027 said an insider.Indeed, it was noticeable how nervous Meghan appeared as she joined the carriage drive last Saturday.\u0027The Queen\u0027s thinking is simple, she wants to put her at her ease,\u0027 says one of her staff.When the invitation arrived, officials assumed Harry would be included too. Instead, it was made clear this was to be a visit for just the two women.Intriguingly, the programme was not especially designed for Meghan – as it was when the Queen took Kate to Leicester where the two sat through a fashion show. In fact it was deliberately planned as a day of typical royal events that would give Meghan a better grounding in the royal routine.\u0027Nothing too starry, lots of handshaking and meeting of local worthies,\u0027 as one insider puts it.    A sudden gust of wind made Meghan’s decision not to wear a hat on her first official engagement with the Queen rather noticeableSo a message was sent to the Queen’s private office asking what the sovereign intended to wear. The answer included mention of the hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan, which some would have taken as a suggestion for Meghan to do the same.But after some discussion, it was agreed between Buckingham and Kensington Palaces that the duchess would let her brunette locks flow free.                        So much has happened to Meghan since her wedding day: Nottingham Cottage where she and Harry live at Kensington Palace has been redecorated and the couple have spent time at their new country bolthole in Oxfordshire.Nevertheless, it is not difficult to imagine how the duchess must have been feeling as she arrived at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening.Whenever the Queen takes the Royal Train there is a protocol to be observed. She dines first at home and then she travels to the station, on this occasion Euston.Meghan, too, had already had supper and the two women were driven together at 10.45pm along with a handful of senior staff. Domestic staff, including footmen, stewards and a dresser, had gone ahead.Once on board the train it is understood the Queen was keen to turn in. She doesn\u0027t like eating late but she did want to ensure that Meghan was comfortable.It must have been an eye-opening experience for the American-born duchess. There are no showers on the train, but full-size baths.   The pair shared a joke during the opening ceremony, showing how a bond is clearly developing between the two women  The Queen looked in great spirits as she began her day out with Harry\u0027s new wife and the pair showed their lighthearted bond as they laughed together during an opening ceremony for the new Mersey Gateway Bridge  The Queen and Meghan were all smiles as they left Chester Town Hall, with both women carrying pretty bouquets of flowers It is thought that Meghan was provided with Prince Philip\u0027s saloon which includes a bedroom, bathroom and sitting room.By the time the train and its royal passengers arrived at Runcorn, Cheshire, yesterday morning after breakfast, Meghan and the Queen had spoken about the day ahead.That much was clear as they exchanged several observations during the ceremony to mark the opening of the Mersey Gateway Bridge.By the time she had watched the Queen unveil two plaques, completed a walkabout, attended a civic lunch and accepted numerous posies, her early stiffness had gone and she began to relax.Next week\u0027s carriage drive at Royal Ascot should be breeze. And next month sees an event where it\u0027s just possible that the Queen will be turning to the newest member of the family for help – the arrival in London of Meghan\u0027s fellow American, US President Donald Trump.          While the Queen was vibrant in green, Meghan opted for a more pared back look in an elegant cream dress with a cape detail around the shoulders "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/15/08/4D3739DF00000578-0-image-a-14_1529048985189.jpg","title":"Have hero builders chase teenage joyriders Bristol","story":"This is the moment a pair of joyriders in Bristol were chased down by a group of have-a-go hero builders after the duo tried to make a break for it in a Peugeot 206A builder wearing a hardhat and overalls steps in and tries to stop the pair escaping and seemingly pulls the keys from the ignition.The teenager in the passenger seat tries to flee, quickly followed by the driver who realises the builders have got them surrounded.One of the pair manages to escape down a side road while the second runs into a dead end and is collared by the group of builders and marched back to the car.Benefits cheat, 61, took family on dream trip to Disneyland...A date with the Queen?

As machines increasingly shape global events, how can we regain control?The voice-activated gadget in the corner of your bedroom suddenly laughs maniacally, and sends a recording of your pillow talk to a colleague. The clip of Peppa Pig your toddler is watching on YouTube unexpectedly descends into bloodletting and death. The social network you use to keep in touch with old school friends turns out to be influencing elections and fomenting coups.Something strange has happened to our way of thinking – and as a result, even stranger things are happening to the world. We have come to believe that everything is computable and can be resolved by the application of new technologies. But these technologies are not neutral facilitators: they embody our politics and biases, they extend beyond the boundaries of nations and legal jurisdictions and increasingly exceed the understanding of even their creators. As a result, we understand less and less about the world as these powerful technologies assume more control over our everyday lives.Across the sciences and society, in politics and education, in warfare and commerce, new technologies are not merely augmenting our abilities, they are actively shaping and directing them, for better and for worse. If we do not understand how complex technologies function then their potential is more easily captured by selfish elites and corporations. The results of this can be seen all around us. There is a causal relationship between the complex opacity of the systems we encounter every day and global issues of inequality, violence, populism and fundamentalism.Instead of a utopian future in which technological advancement casts a dazzling, emancipatory light on the world, we seem to be entering a new dark age characterised by ever more bizarre and unforeseen events. The Enlightenment ideal of distributing more information ever more widely has not led us to greater understanding and growing peace, but instead seems to be fostering social isions, distrust, conspiracy theories and post-factual politics. To understand what is happening, it’s necessary to understand how our technologies have come to be, and how we have come to place so much faith in them.In the 1950s, a new symbol began to creep into the diagrams drawn by electrical engineers to describe the systems they built: a fuzzy circle, or a puffball, or a thought bubble. Eventually, its form settled into the shape of a cloud. Whatever the engineer was working on, it could connect to this cloud, and that’s all you needed to know. The other cloud could be a power system, or a data exchange, or another network of computers. Whatever. It didn’t matter. The cloud was a way of reducing complexity, it allowed you to focus on the issues at hand. Over time, as networks grew larger and more interconnected, the cloud became more important. It became a business buzzword and a selling point. It became more than engineering shorthand it became a metaphor.Today the cloud is the central metaphor of the internet: a global system of great power and energy that nevertheless retains the aura of something numinous, almost impossible to grasp. We work in it we store and retrieve stuff from it it is something we experience all the time without really understanding what it is. But there’s a problem with this metaphor: the cloud is not some magical faraway place, made of water vapour and radio waves, where everything just works. It is a physical infrastructure consisting of phone lines, fibre optics, satellites, cables on the ocean floor, and vast warehouses filled with computers, which consume huge amounts of water and energy. Absorbed into the cloud are many of the previously weighty edifices of the civic sphere: the places where we shop, bank, socialise, borrow books and vote. Thus obscured, they are rendered less visible and less amenable to critique, investigation, preservation and regulation.Over the last few decades, trading floors around the world have fallen silent, as people are replaced by banks of computers that trade automatically. Digitisation meant that trades within, as well as between, stock exchangescould happen faster and faster. As trading passed into the hands of machines, it became possible to react almost instantaneously. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithms, designed by former physics PhD students to take advantage of millisecond advantages, entered the market, and traders gave them names such as The Knife. These algorithms were capable of eking out fractions of a cent on every trade, and they could do it millions of times a day.In the chaos of those 25 minutes, 2bn shares, worth $56bn, changed hands. Even more worryingly, many orders were executed at what the Securities Exchange Commission called “irrational prices”: as low as a penny, or as high as $100,000. The event became known as the “flash crash”, and it is still being investigated and argued over years later.One report by regulators found that high-frequency traders exacerbated the price swings. Among the various HFT programs, many had hard-coded sell points: prices at which they were programmed to sell their stocks immediately. As prices started to fall, groups of programs were triggered to sell at the same time. As each waypoint was passed, the subsequent price fall triggered another set of algorithms to automatically sell their stocks, producing a feedback effect. As a result, prices fell faster than any human trader could react to. While experienced market players might have been able to stabilise the crash by playing a longer game, the machines, faced with uncertainty, got out as quickly as possible.Other theories blame the algorithms for initiating the crisis. One technique that was identified in the data was HFT programmes sending large numbers of “non-executable” orders to the exchanges – that is, orders to buy or sell stocks so far outside of their usual prices that they would be ignored. The purpose of such orders is not to actually communicate or make money, but to deliberately cloud the system, so that other, more valuable trades can be executed in the confusion. Many orders that were never intended to be executed were actually fulfilled, causing wild volatility.At 1.07pm on 23 April 2013 Associated Press sent a tweet to its 2 million followers: “Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.” The message was the result of a hack later claimed by the Syrian Electronic Army, a group affiliated to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. AP and other journalists quickly flooded the site with alerts that the message was false. The algorithms following breaking news stories had no such discernment, however. At 1.08pm, the Dow Jones went into a nosee. Before most human viewers had even seen the tweet, the index had fallen 150 points in under two minutes, and bounced back to its earlier value. In that time, it erased $136bn in equity market value.Computation is increasingly layered across, and hidden within, every object in our lives, and with its expansion comes an increase in opacity and unpredictability. One of the touted benefits of Samsung’s line of “smart fridges” in 2015 was their integration with Google’s calendar services, allowing owners to schedule grocery deliveries from the kitchen. It also meant that hackers who gained access to the then inadequately secured machines could read their owner’s Gmail passwords. Researchers in Germany discovered a way to insert malicious code into Philips’s wifi-enabled Hue lightbulbs, which could spread from fixture to fixture throughout a building or even a city, turning the lights rapidly on and off and – in one possible scenario – triggering photosensitive epilepsy. This is the approach favoured by Byron the Bulb in Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow, an act of grand revolt by the little machines against the tyranny of their makers. Once-fictional possibilities for technological violence are being realised by the Internet of Things.In Kim Stanley Robinson’s novel Aurora, an intelligent spacecraft carries a human crew from Earth to a distant star. The journey will take multiple lifetimes, so one of the ship’s jobs is to ensure that the humans look after themselves. When their fragile society breaks down, threatening the mission, the ship deploys safety systems as a means of control: it is able to see everywhere through sensors, open or seal doors at will, speak so loudly through its communications equipment that it causes physical pain, and use fire suppression systems to draw down the level of oxygen in a particular space.This is roughly the same suite of operations available now from Google Home and its partners: a network of internet-connected cameras for home security, smart locks on doors, a thermostat capable of raising and lowering the temperature in inidual rooms, and a fire and intruder detection system that emits a piercing emergency alarm. Any successful hacker would have the same powers as the Aurora does over its crew, or Byron over his hated masters.Before dismissing such scenarios as the fever dreams of science fiction writers, consider again the rogue algorithms in the stock exchanges. These are not isolated events, but everyday occurrences within complex systems. The question then becomes, what would a rogue algorithm or a flash crash look like in the wider reality?Mirai, in fact, looks like nothing so much as Stuxnet, another virus discovered within the industrial control systems of hydroelectric plants and factory assembly lines in 2010. Stuxnet was a military-grade cyberweapon when dissected, it was found to be aimed specifically at Siemens centrifuges, and designed to go off when it encountered a facility that possessed a particular number of such machines. That number corresponded with one particular facility: the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran. When activated, the program would quietly degrade crucial components of the centrifuges, causing them to break down and disrupt the Iranian enrichment programme.The attack was apparently partially successful, but the effect on other infected facilities is unknown. To this day, despite obvious suspicions, nobody knows where Stuxnet came from, or who made it. Nobody knows for certain who developed Mirai, either, or where its next iteration might come from, but it might be there, right now, breeding in the CCTV camera in your office, or the wifi-enabled kettle in the corner of your kitchen.Or perhaps the crash will look like a string of blockbuster movies pandering to rightwing conspiracies and survivalist fantasies, from quasi-fascist superheroes (Captain America and the Batman series) to justifications of torture and assassination (Zero Dark Thirty, American Sniper). In Hollywood, studios run their scripts through the neural networks of a company called Epagogix, a system trained on the unstated preferences of millions of moviegoers developed over decades in order to predict which lines will push the right – meaning the most lucrative – emotional buttons. Algorithmic engines enhanced with data from Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and others, with access to the minute-by-minute preferences of millions of video watchers acquire a level of cognitive insight undreamed of by previous regimes. Feeding directly on the frazzled, binge-watching desires of news-saturated consumers, the network turns on itself, reflecting, reinforcing and heightening the paranoia inherent in the system.Game developers enter endless cycles of updates and in-app purchases directed by AB testing interfaces and real-time monitoring of players’ behaviours. They have such a fine-grained grasp of dopamine-producing neural pathways that teenagers die of exhaustion in front of their computers, unable to tear themselves away.Or perhaps the flash crash will look like literal nightmares broadcast across the network for all to see? In the summer of 2015, the sleep disorders clinic of an Athens hospital was busier than it had ever been: the country’s debt crisis was in its most turbulent period. Among the patients were top politicians and civil servants, but the machines they spent the nights hooked up to, monitoring their breathing, their movements, even the things they said out loud in their sleep, were sending that information, together with their personal medical details, back to the manufacturers’ diagnostic data farms in northern Europe. What whispers might escape from such facilities?We are able to record every aspect of our daily lives by attaching technology to the surface of our bodies, persuading us that we too can be optimised and upgraded like our devices. Smart bracelets and smartphone apps with integrated step counters and galvanic skin response monitors track not only our location, but every breath and heartbeat, even the patterns of our brainwaves. Users are encouraged to lay their phones beside them on their beds at night, so that their sleep patterns can be recorded. Where does all this data go, who owns it, and when might it come out? Data on our dreams, our night terrors and early morning sweating jags, the very substance of our unconscious selves, turn into more fuel for systems both pitiless and inscrutable.Or perhaps the flash crash in reality looks exactly like everything we are experiencing right now: rising economic inequality, the breakdown of the nation-state and the militarisation of borders, totalising global surveillance and the curtailment of inidual freedoms, the triumph of transnational corporations and neurocognitive capitalism, the rise of far-right groups and nativist ideologies, and the degradation of the natural environment. None of these are the direct result of novel technologies, but all of them are the product of a general inability to perceive the wider, networked effects of inidual and corporate actions accelerated by opaque, technologically augmented complexity.In New York in 1997, world chess champion Garry Kasparov faced off for the second time against Deep Blue, a computer specially designed by IBM to beat him. When he lost, he claimed some of Deep Blue’s moves were so intelligent and creative that they must have been the result of human intervention. But we understand why Deep Blue made those moves: its process for selecting them was ultimately one of brute force, a massively parallel architecture of 14,000 custom-designed chess chips, capable of analysing 200m board positions per second. Kasparov was not outthought, merely outgunned.By the time the Google Brain–powered AlphaGo software took on the Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol in 2016, something had changed. In the second of five games, AlphaGo played a move that stunned Sedol, placing one of its stones on the far side of the board. “That’s a very strange move,” said one commentator. “I thought it was a mistake,” said another. Fan Hui, a seasoned Go player who had been the first professional to lose to the machine six months earlier, said: “It’s not a human move. I’ve never seen a human play this move.”AlphaGo went on to win the game, and the series. AlphaGo’s engineers developed its software by feeding a neural network millions of moves by expert Go players, and then getting it to play itself millions of times more, developing strategies that outstripped those of human players. But its own representation of those strategies is illegible: we can see the moves it made, but not how it decided to make them.The late Iain M Banks called the place where these moves occurred “Infinite Fun Space”. In Banks’s SF novels, his Culture civilisation is administered by benevolent, superintelligent AIs called simply Minds. While the Minds were originally created by humans, they have long since redesigned and rebuilt themselves and become all-powerful. Between controlling ships and planets, directing wars and caring for billions of humans, the Minds also take up their own pleasures. Capable of simulating entire universes within their imaginations, some Minds retreat for ever into Infinite Fun Space, a realm of meta-mathematical possibility, accessible only to superhuman artificial intelligences.Many of us are familiar with Google Translate, which was launched in 2006, using a technique called statistical language inference. Rather than trying to understand how languages actually worked, the system imbibed vast corpora of existing translations: parallel texts with the same content in different languages. By simply mapping words on to one another, it removed human understanding from the equation and replaced it with data-driven correlation.Translate was known for its humorous errors, but in 2016, the system started using a neural network developed by Google Brain, and its abilities improved exponentially. Rather than simply cross-referencing heaps of texts, the network builds its own model of the world, and the result is not a set of two-dimensional connections between words, but a map of the entire territory. In this new architecture, words are encoded by their distance from one another in a mesh of meaning – a mesh only a computer could comprehend.While a human can draw a line between the words “tank” and “water” easily enough, it quickly becomes impossible to draw on a single map the lines between “tank” and “revolution”, between “water” and “liquidity”, and all of the emotions and inferences that cascade from those connections. The map is thus multidimensional, extending in more directions than the human mind can hold. As one Google engineer commented, when pursued by a journalist for an image of such a system: “I do not generally like trying to visualise thousand-dimensional vectors in three-dimensional space.” This is the unseeable space in which machine learning makes its meaning. Beyond that which we are incapable of visualising is that which we are incapable of even understanding.In the same year, other researchers at Google Brain set up three networks called Alice, Bob and Eve. Their task was to learn how to encrypt information. Alice and Bob both knew a number – a key, in cryptographic terms – that was unknown to Eve. Alice would perform some operation on a string of text, and then send it to Bob and Eve. If Bob could decode the message, Alice’s score increased but if Eve could, Alice’s score decreased.Over thousands of iterations, Alice and Bob learned to communicate without Eve breaking their code: they developed a private form of encryption like that used in private emails today. But crucially, we don’t understand how this encryption works. Its operation is occluded by the deep layers of the network. What is hidden from Eve is also hidden from us. The machines are learning to keep their secrets.How we understand and think of our place in the world, and our relation to one another and to machines, will ultimately decide where our technologies will take us. We cannot unthink the network we can only think through and within it. The technologies that inform and shape our present perceptions of reality are not going to go away, and in many cases we should not wish them to. Our current life support systems on a planet of 7.5 billion people and rising depend on them. Our understanding of those systems, and of the conscious choices we make in their design, remain entirely within our capabilities. We are not powerless, not without agency. We only have to think, and think again, and keep thinking. The network – us and our machines and the things we think and discover together – demands it.Computational systems, as tools, emphasise one of the most powerful aspects of humanity: our ability to act effectively in the world and shape it to our desires. But uncovering and articulating those desires, and ensuring that they do not degrade, overrule, efface, or erase the desires of others, remains our prerogative.When Kasparov was defeated back in 1997, he didn’t give up the game. A year later, he returned to competitive play with a new format: advanced, or centaur, chess. In advanced chess, humans partner, rather than compete, with machines. And it rapidly became clear that something very interesting resulted from this approach. While even a mid-level chess computer can today wipe the floor with most grandmasters, an average player paired with an average computer is capable of beating the most sophisticated supercomputer – and the play that results from this combination of ways of thinking has revolutionised the game. It remains to be seen whether cooperation is possible – or will be permitted – with the kinds of complex machines and systems of governance now being developed, but understanding and thinking together offer a more hopeful path forward than obfuscation and dominance.Our technologies are extensions of ourselves, codified in machines and infrastructures, in frameworks of knowledge and action. Computers are not here to give us all the answers, but to allow us to put new questions, in new ways, to the universe •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cbd2f4e06f422a36336ccd3b066e271a88a21ed/0_251_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2700037e63884324ac9e182c5334e8ad","title":"lib dem bounce lewisham east labour brexit stance byelection","story":"The byelection shows the party must tread a careful Brexit tightrope to succeed – or let the Jacob Rees-Moggified Tories winFor those of us who don’t like Brexit but particularly fear an ideologically driven Tory hard Brexit, this would be a big mistake.Turnout in the byelection was miserably low: a mere third of eligible voters took part. In last year’s general election, nearly seven out of 10 participated, handing Labour its biggest ever victory in the constituency, surpassing the figure chalked up in the landslide year of 1997 by nearly 10 percentage points. Both turnout and Labour’s success are linked. Corbyn’s Labour mobilised younger voters and previous non-voters who may be persuaded to march to a polling station in a general election, but not in a byelection. Those particularly fired up about an issue – in this case Brexit – can make a particular impact in a low-turnout byelection, knowing that they won’t risk a Tory victory in doing so.Brexit is a Tory-engineered mess that Labour did not want. The party has to walk a political tightrope on Brexit because it represents staunchly pro-remain communities like Lewisham, Hackney and Islington, as well as heavily pro-leave communities like Doncaster, Hull and Ashfield. After Labour accepted the referendum result, voted for the triggering of article 50, and made no firm commitments on the single market or customs union in the general election, the narrative was that it would fatally alienate remain voters. But that did not happen. Since then it has softened its approach to Brexit, not least committing to a customs union – and it rightly frets over its leave flank. The only seats Labour lost last year voted decisively for Brexit, such as Mansfield, Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and Stoke-on-Trent South.Labour’s majorities slumped in strongly pro-leave constituencies (such as Ashfield, Dudley North and Bolsover), and Labour MPs representing these communities report that Brexit supporters ask in baffled tones why Britain hasn’t left the EU yet – and believe politicians are trying to thwart their vote. The reason those such as Gloria De Piero and Caroline Flint – Labour MPs who could hardly be described as Corbynites – are emphatic about the need to implement the referendum result is because they know what their constituents are telling them. That doesn’t mean signing up to whatever the Tories put forward, no matter how hard a Brexit, but it does mean accepting that the debate is about how we leave the EU, not if we should.Amid all the noise, the fact is if you voted leave or remain in 2016, polling suggests you would vote the same way again. To borrow Theresa May’s phrase, nothing has changed: not meaningfully, anyway. There is a strong case to be made that, after a second referendum campaign, Brexit would win an even bigger majority, poison our politics even more, and make the likelihood of a hard Brexit all the more likely. There are remain voters who believe the referendum result should be implemented there are others who would like it reversed, but will vote Labour because they understand what the alternative is.If Labour is to form a majority government with a transformative programme to deal with some of the injustices that drove Brexit in the first place, as well as avoid an ideologically driven Tory Brexit, it needs to build a broad coalition of remain and leave voters. That means offering a compromise: accepting the referendum result but remaining in a customs union, for example.It must also talk about other issues. May wanted to frame last year’s general election as a rerun of the referendum. Labour did not let her, shifting the conversation on other domestic issues, allowing it to deprive the Tories of their majority. The next election is not in the bag for Labour, and its leaders know that. Outside of an election campaign, they haven’t managed to recapture the sense of insurgency that drove their vote surge last year, and that should worry them. But if they fall off their Brexit tightrope, Jacob Rees-Moggified Tories will win the next general election, leaving us with the worst Brexit of all and a profoundly reactionary government to boot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25f266a3aef63b8db5e074d1be168b8b292c5cde/0_49_5544_3327/master/5544.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fe80cfb860238ff91dc6cfe73d7bfa5","title":"two state solution un mandate razan al najja israel palestine","story":"The UN general assembly has condemned Israel for using “excessive force” against unarmed civilian demonstrators in Gaza. The draft resolution was adopted on Wednesday by 120 votes to eight, with 45 abstentions. The opposing states included the US, which had vetoed a similar resolution at the security council a few days earlier.Most significantly, the resolution called on the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to report back within 60 days “on ways and means for ensuring the safety, protection and wellbeing of the Palestinian civilian population under Israeli occupation, including ... recommendations regarding an international protection mechanism”.Of course the UN is only ever as effective as member states allow it to be. This old saw has been particularly true when it comes to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, where the UN’s responsibility for, but failure to bring about, the creation of a Palestinian state as part of a “two-state solution” is so glaringly obvious. Israeli forces continue to act with near impunity, seemingly beyond the reach of international law. The 120 recorded recent killings include the 21-year-old volunteer paramedic Razan al-Najjar, shot in the chest and killed near the separation fence between Israel and Gaza. Her only defence was her white medic’s tunic. Her apparent “crime”: assisting unarmed demonstrators who’d been shot and were writhing in agony on the ground.The likelihood of the Israeli sniper being brought to justice is extremely slim. Indeed, it seems more likely that planned new legislation that would bar the reporting of such incidents in the media could soon be enacted if Benjamin Netanyahu’s administration gets its way.We appear to be living in increasingly lawless times. Article 24 of the Geneva convention states: “Medical personnel exclusively engaged in the … treating of wounded shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.” But in general, talk of the Geneva convention – when civilians can be targeted with barrel bombs by state authorities in Syria or Saudi missiles in Yemen, and unarmed demonstrators are shot at by Israeli army snipers – just serves as a reminder that leaders from Netanyahu to Assad, from Putin to Duterte, will do whatever they like if they can get away with it.Those countries who still have some clout on the UN security council and influence with European governments should begin to throw their weight around and push for something altogether more substantial than the protection force favoured by a majority of UN member states.In the case of Israel’s flagrant disregard for the civilians it is supposed to be protecting, it is surely time to draw up a brand new mandate for a UN force and administration in the occupied territories. This could protect Palestinians, and also organise long overdue elections to prepare the territories for full independence. It could be a fully fledged UN mandate, perhaps similar to the former UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (formerly East Timor) that successfully paved the way for the ending of Indonesian rule, which itself followed hundreds of years of Portuguese colonial rule. This intervention by the UN paved the way for free and fair elections and independence.The idea of a UN mandate elicits backing from Nadia Hijab, of the Palestinian thinktank Al-Shabaka, who says: “A UN mandate over the occupied territories is worthy of serious consideration. Israel has made no secret of its project to colonise and annex occupied territory, and indeed has annexed Palestinian East Jerusalem and Syria’s Golan Heights. Settlement building and annexation are unlawful and mean continued destruction of lands, homes, and lives. A UN mandate would provide protection not just for Palestinians, but for all those living within and beyond the occupied territories.”To which might be added the need to recognise the special status of Jerusalem, an issue that Donald Trump has blundered into by recognising the city as Israel’s “capital”. The “mandate” refers to the British rule of Palestine sanctioned by the League of Nations after the first world war. When Palestine was officially partitioned by the UN following the ending of the British mandate in 1948, Jerusalem was to be a corpus separatum, and was supposed to remain under UN administration. This never happened, but maybe it is now time for the responsible international community to put this firmly back on the table as the precursor to providing a full UN mandate over all the occupied Palestinian territories.What do the Europeans in particular have to lose by championing this just and entirely pragmatic cause? Europe’s leaders could bask in the warm, unfamiliar glow of widespread international approval. And more important, the forgotten, oppressed Palestinians may be able to conclude that there is some hope and justice for them after all.• Mark Seddon was a speechwriter for the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon.

Sofia Genders, co-founder of End of the Road Festival and Sheffield insider, has your ultimate 48-hour guide to the cityDay one – yoga, shopping and arty hangoutsExplore what Sheffield’s buzzing neighbourhoods have to offer. Spend the morning getting to know the hip, leafy suburb of Nether Edge – start with a yoga class at Hot Yoga Sheffield on Edgedale Road, then grab a healthy smoothie at the Wild Leaf cafe next door. Yoga was such a great stress-buster when I was running End of the Road festival, and it never fails to put me in a great frame of mind, whether I’m working or enjoying a day off.Next, take a stroll to nearby Abbeydale Road, also known as the antiques quarter. On the first Sunday of the month this vintage wonderland of a street also hosts a flea market at the Abbeydale Picture House – a gorgeous old venue that regularly screens black-and-white early cinema and hosts various cultural events. Spend some time wandering around the Vaults to find something special among the weird and wonderful retro items, or try the eclectic Rileys \u0026amp Co for vintage furniture, kitsch collectables and local crafts. I also love finding bargains in charity shops – there are quite a few along Abbeydale Road. Sticking with the retro theme, a visit to Jameson’s Cafe \u0026amp Tea Rooms is my all-time favourite afternoon tea spot, with great service and a live pianist. Two minutes walk down the road, there’s a great secondhand record store called Below. Also close by on Nether Edge Road, is the intimate and laid back Cafe #9 – perfect for a pick-me-up, plus they host live music now and again.As the afternoon rolls on, head to the villagey Sharrow Vale Road, where you can browse independent shops, delis and boutiques – such as the Front Parlour or Porter Book Shop – before grabbing an artisan doughnut and coffee from Eve Kitchen.If you need something more substantial, you could grab a late lunch from Porter Pizza on Sharrow Vale Road, probably the best pizza in town. It’s takeaway-only but the gorgeous Endcliffe Park is just around the corner, and is a top spot for a pizza picnic and a quick post-lunch stroll around the beautiful woodland.Alternatively, hop in a cab to Chesterfield Road in the up-and-coming Meersbrook area. Here, vegans are in luck: Make No Bones restaurant on Chesterfield Road is a true local’s favourite, or Just Falafs, on the same street, is a great fallback. That’s not to say that carnivores aren’t also well catered for in the area. I also really love the Tramshed Bar \u0026amp Kitchen – they’ve got a brilliant Asian menu, or you could just pop into the bar for a drink or two.Speaking of drinks, in the evening, Takk bar on Queens Road, Heeley, right on the edge of Sheffield city centre, is a great place for a dance and a cocktail in a fairy lit garden. You’ll find it in Hagglers Corner, a creative courtyard community of artists and independent makers, which doubles as an arts venue. If pubs are more your thing, the Brothers Arms and the Sheaf View are both nearby and have a reputation for top quality real ale.If you’re after a gig, try the Audacious Art Experiment, the eponymous venue of the local record label, on Harwood Street. Alternatively, head back to Abbeydale Road and check out Picture House Social, for an eclectic line-up of music events, with great cocktails, craft beer, Italian-inspired street food and a games room, too. I’m a big fan of small, independent venues with creative programming as they’re vital to a healthy music industry – both are destinations for the in-the-know crowd and have some great shows on.Day two – coffee, cake and creative curationThe second day is when you’ll find out what the city centre has to offer, plus a visit to Kelham Island, a riverside area that was once the central hub of Sheffield’s industry, and one of the oldest sites of its kind in the city.Start your day with a good coffee. There are so many great places to choose from, depending on where you are based. Tamper is a New Zealand coffee place with an industrial feel – its main outpost is housed in a 19th-century former silversmith workshop on Arundel Street. On the same street is the Holt, a true hidden gem of a coffee place, while tucked away on Aberdeen Court is Steam Yard, with a cosy feel and amazing cakes.Spend the rest of your morning checking out some of the best shops the city has to offer – in particular stroll along Division Street and the surrounding roads. Syd and Mallory sells the best handmade clothing and reworked fashion. La Biblioteka is a great little bookshop stocking a massive range of magazines and books from independent publishers, plus stationery. When I’m looking for good music, I often discover something new and fresh at Bear Tree Records – a lovely shop that sells both new and secondhand vinyl.While you wander, keep your eyes peeled. Sheffield is full of great street art, sculpture, graffiti and wall murals by local artists such as Jo Peel, Faunagraphic, Phlegm and more. Street Art Sheffield lists many of the sites if you’d like to plan ahead. One of my favourite sculptures is the Women of Steel by Martin Jennings outside City Hall. It commemorates the women who worked in the city’s steel industry during the first and second world wars.After a morning stroll, stop for lunch at Dina Diner, a vegetarian and vegan cafe attached to a music, comedy, poetry and theatre venue that is a social enterprise and platform for emerging artists. Dina is an example of what I like about most of Sheffield’s creative spaces: the really thoughtful curation. Similarly, Gloam Gallery is another great space dedicated to creativity. Gloam’s Instagram is exciting and exhibitions here are fresh and unusual. In September, the Site Gallery will also be re-opening – another great creative space to check out.For dinner head to Kelham Island and the cosy, neighbourhood restaurant Stew and Oyster. Later in the evening, check out the Delicious Clam – a record label and an unmissable DIY venue where you’re guaranteed to hear something interesting and underground. A lot of bands start out there and it’s worth catching a show if you can. Something entirely different is Public, a recently-opened cocktail bar in a converted old public toilet – it’s another small venue, and really worth it.Last but not least, be sure to check out what is one of the best railway station pubs in the country – the Sheffield Tap, a place where my husband and I love to sit and watch the world go by. Located within the old first-class waiting room, this pub is also a microbrewery and has a great selection of craft beers. Enjoy and don’t worry if you miss your train home as Sheffield has more than enough to offer for further adventures.

In fact, with its fixie bikes, cobbled streets, Noma-ish foraged cuisine and design-first ethos, it almost feels like a pocket of Copenhagen that just happens to be a 90-minute train ride from London. Throw in the refurbished 1920s theme park Dreamland and it all adds up to an irresistible artist’s enclave for a weekend city. Armed with effusive recommendations from my Airbnb host Clare – a trend-forecaster and trainee florist ­– I set about experiencing the best of the Kentish coast’s new capital of cool. Here’s my guide to getting the best out of a trip to this unique seaside town.Follow the foodie trailThe seafront chippies are still drawing crowds (and e-bombing seagulls) but in recent years, Margate’s culinary scene has evolved. Open since 2015, Hantverk \u0026amp Found is a seafood cafe and gallery that exemplifies that uptick in quality, whether you’re after a big last-night-of-the-trip dinner or a casual lunch slurping local rock oysters spiked with yuzu (a citrus fruit) in the suntrap garden. The food is unfussy and brightly flavoured – think clams in a spicy Korean broth and bream with a heady brown shrimp butter. The dinky emerald-tiled room adds a lively, squashed-in thrum to proceedings.For a legendary cheese toastie, and great rooftop views for sunset, head to Cheesy Tiger on the jutting Harbour Arm, my Airbnb host advises. There’s also friendly little Fez bar, a quirky, eclectic boozer close by. Or for an array of beachfront eating and drinking options, then the The Bus Cafe – with its crammed and zingy salad wraps – and the adjacent Sun Deck, are the places to head to. “There’s a really good juice bar, Po’ Boy that does great Creole-style food, and a cool tiki bar,” says Ed Warren, local and co-founder of Cliffs record shop and cafe.Sound out local musicThere aren’t many cafes where you can watch an experimental radio show broadcasting to the world and have a flat white made by a double Mercury Music prize-winning nominee. A labour of love for musician Obara Ejimiwe (aka Ghostpoet) and his creative director wife Kate, Radio Margate is a hybrid coffee shop, late-night venue and internet radio station launched in 2017 following their move from London. This sea-view space – all calming jazz and tasteful mid-century furniture – is, according to the Ejimiwes, a direct result of Margate’s contagious creative energy. “It’s totally infectious and there’s more room here to develop strong, independent ideas,” Obara says.Housed in a lovingly restored former 1920s tearoom in Cliftonville, Cliffs is a record shop that also encompasses a fitness studio, coffee roastery, hair salon, gig venue and an exceptional cafe (try the harissa oil and avocado toast). “I just wanted to sell Motown records but we got caught up in it all, like a lot of people here do,” says owner Ed Warren, explaining how he and his interior designer partner Kier Muddiman found themselves presiding over this artfully-distressed cultural fiefdom. “All these interesting little places in Margate are from the heart, basically.”Hit refreshWalpole Bay tidal pool is a must for lovers of outdoor swimming. It is the UK’s largest saltwater bathing pool, covering 4 acres (1.6 hectares), and was built in 1937. A group of locals swear by a regular swim in this beautiful coastal location, which fills up at high tide each day. “The first time I jumped in I squealed with excitement as the cold water engulfed me,” says Kathryn Ferguson, Margate resident and director of Taking the Waters, a short film about the pool. “But it felt exhilarating and from that moment I was totally hooked. A full moon swim is something I’d recommend everyone to try once.”Sticking with the theme of wellness, it’s worth stopping by natural fragrance and skincare company Haeckels to pick up a few restorative products to take home. One of the town’s most famous success stories, it was founded by Dom Bridges, a former film director who turned a hobby making soap from foraged Margate seaweed into a brand stocked in Harvey Nichols. Still, little can prepare you for the surprise of its flagship laboratory, shop and sea-based thalassotherapy spa, high up on a blustery Cliftonville parade. “It’s an example of the fact that each business has an amazing story of its own,” says Shelly Keeys, owner of shrewdly curated local fashion store Ruskin.Shop independent art and designThose that know their parlour palms from their succulents will feel at home in the jungle interior of Mar Mar, a cafe, gift shop and houseplant emporium on Northdown Road. Bolstering the town’s roster of design boutiques (homewares store Môr is worth a look too), it grew from Central St Martins graduate Boe Holder’s bold, Memphis Group-influenced creations. “She used to do pot painting and sell these great plant pots online,” says Margate-based photographer Harriet Bentley. “Now they’re selling plants, coffee, magazines and other great little things. It’s so cool.”Other interiors shops worth seeking out include: Clayspace Studios, a social enterprise and ceramics store Danish Collectables for curated Scandinavian vintage pieces Papillon Interiors for vibrant indoor and outdoor furniture and Imagineican Store, a tiny design and lifestyle studio. If you hire a bike during your trip, Westgate-on-sea is about a 15-minute cycle from Margate’s seafront, and is home to Eighty Two Westgate.Of course, one of the biggest draws in town for art is the Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and sowed the first seeds for the current regenerative flowering. Smaller venues, such as Pie Factory in the Old Town, also a studio complex and, yes, former pie shop, are increasingly offering a platform to Margate’s thriving ecosystem of emerging visual artists and Turner-exhibited stars of tomorrow. “There’s such a strong creative network here,” notes Dan Chilcott, co-founder of nearby Resort Studios, who put together a June show at the Pie Factory. “As an artist, it’s right where you want to be.”Jimi Famurewa is a London-based freelance writer and editor.

Teachers, students and parents were informed last week that the Discovery school in Newcastle would shut its doors for good, ahead of another damning report from the education watchdog, Ofsted.Inspectors were called in for a snap inspection after safeguarding concerns were raised when a child was left behind in London during a school trip in March.The Ofsted report revealed that staff were unable to cope with bad and at times dangerous behaviour, while teaching quality plummeted and children were left “underachieving”.In more detailed findings about behaviour, Ofsted inspectors wrote: “A hard core of pupils display riotous behaviour and they roam the school in a predatory manner. The small numbers of girls and others who are singled out as different are vulnerable and do not always feel safe. “The frequency of dangerous and unacceptable behaviour is shockingly high.”Inspectors described the behaviour of year 9 pupils being so bad that they were barred from using machinery or the computer suite because of safety concerns.The report claimed racism, sexism and bullying were prevalent, with pupils sharing “depressing testimony of their ordeals and perceived lack of adult support” with inspectors.The government withdrew funding for the specialist science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (Stem) school before its second-ever Ofsted report. Opened in 2014, at a reported cost of £9m, the free school invited students from across the north-east to experience an “alternative option to a traditional school”. But during its first inspection in July 2017 inspectors said it had a “narrow and unbalanced” curriculum that was “failing to meet pupils’ needs”.Its governing body, overseen by the NCG group, which also runs Newcastle College, was told there were key failings in its responsibilities, including in overseeing safeguarding. The school has also struggled to attract pupils despite having capacity for up to 700 pupils, it currently has just 228 enrolled. The school will close at the end of the academic year. A spokesperson said: “Clearly this Ofsted report makes for difficult reading and the depth and severity of the comments were a key factor in the decision to close the school.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0665bbd4667c796b177b301e67c41d45df35da7d/0_308_1066_639/master/1066.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=664cddedfb7c6b6e58a7c938206df651","title":"bfi munroe bergdorf women","story":"Institute says it appointed Bergdorf to ‘further the gender debate and encourage audiences to recognise the value of difference’The British Film Institute has come under attack for its decision to appoint the trans model and activist Munroe Bergdorf (who identifies as a woman) as the keynote speaker of its Woman with a Movie Camera summit, which is due to take place on 16 June.An open letter posted on the website ipetitions says Bergdorf’s role is “an an insult to all the women film-makers who struggle on a daily basis to get their films made”. Referring to Bergdorf throughout as male, the letter says: “We question the suitability of a male who has benefitted from the very structures we are critiquing as a speaker on the subject of women’s agency in relation to film-making … What kind of cultural work is being performed when a male is speaking on behalf of women film-makers?”“This speaker is upstaging the very urgency of women’s voices with another ‘what about men?’ narrative. As much as we support the rights of gender non-conforming males to be heard, this is not the forum for it.”The letter is authored by the film-maker and writer Julian Vigo and the film-maker Deirdre O’Neill. In a further statement to the , Vigo said: “The BFI conference allocated a space that should have been taken up by a woman film-maker to a man and so it seems our voices continue to be denied.”The summit is described by the BFI as “a day of talks and events on women, power and film”. It includes events such as Before and After Time’s Up and RIP #strongfemalecharacter.In a statement, the BFI said: “For our keynote speaker we expressly wanted a voice outside of film-making that could widen the lens. We invited Munroe because she represents a contemporary and interesting perspective on the subjects of the day.“We appreciate that Munroe’s involvement has provoked a strong and mixed reaction and we hope it will help further the gender debate in a positive and constructive way and encourage audiences to recognise and acknowledge the quality and value of difference, which we believe is a benefit to our industry and to our wider society.”Bergdorf was fired by L’Oréal in 2017 after posting racially charged comments on Facebook, and was subsequently appointed to Labour’s advisory board on LGBT rights. She quit that role in March after attacks in the tabloid press and by Conservatives.Bergdorf’s lack of experience as a film-maker has also come in for criticism: though she was involved in making Channel 4’s recent documentary What Makes a Woman, Bergdorf has no directing or producer credits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61e0febfe64d8470e1d0e1744f51d6ac2a57551a/116_0_4729_2838/master/4729.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=161aec5788cd38eb12a75841c98b317e","title":"gay cinema radical future","story":"A wave of quietly revolutionary films are taking a thoughtful and celebratory look at queer identity – and reaping the rewards at the box officeOn the penultimate night of this year’s recent Cannes film festival, I went — as is the custom for rosé-seeking journalists hanging on through the last days — to the Queer Palme awards night, where an independent jury announces their pick for the best LGBT-themed film of the fest. It’s traditionally more of a party than an awards ceremony, not least because the winner tends to be a foregone conclusion. That one overtly queer film that was in the official selection? Yep, probably that one.Not so this year, as the cocktail rounds were lightly speckled with speculation after a festival unusually rich in LGBT narratives. The Belgian director Lukas Dhont’s debut Girl, a sensitively wrought study of an aspiring transgender ballerina, prevailed over a number of credible candidates: Kenyan lesbian coming-of-ager Rafiki, tough French rentboy portrait Sauvage, loopy Portuguese elasti-sexual comedy Diamantino and Christophe Honore’s tender Parisian Aids drama Sorry Angel, among others. At an event whose programming is still controversially plagued by representational blind spots – not least its shortage of female film-makers – the rainbow flag was flying at full mast.Cannes wasn’t exactly blazing a trail here. This year’s strong queer showing was indicative of a larger watershed moment for LGBT cinema across the industry, as stories and artists once confined to rarefied corners of the arthouse are being gradually welcomed into the mainstream. This hasn’t been an overnight shift. It’s been 12 years since Brokeback Mountain raked in over £130m worldwide, cracking open Hollywood’s collective idea of what audiences will and won’t respond to (though not without some resistance from conservative factions that cost it an Oscar).The last couple of years, however, have kicked that evolution into fast-forward, helped along by real-world advances in LGBT rights, and the Twitter-assisted revolution in identity politics awareness. The world, in other words, is a very different place for gay and trans people than it was even a decade ago, and cinema is feeling the change. Last year, encouraged by a wave of critical hosannas, even that fusty pool of Oscar voters finally handed their top prize to a drama of gay identity and desire in Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight – a film preoccupied as much with the social oppression of blackness as of homosexuality, making it a once-unthinkably intersectional choice for a predominantly straight, white and privileged body.This year, they nominated Call Me By Your Name, Luca Guadagnino’s woozy evocation of a same-sex summer crush – the kind of handsome European delicacy that would once have been deemed a niche item, but is now an object of obsessive youth fandom, memed and gif-ed and quoted to within an inch of its life across social media. It lost the best picture to The Shape of Water: not a directly queer film, but one whose romantic interspecies fantasy rallied gay, black and disabled characters in joint support of alternative sexuality. At the same ceremony, the best foreign language film prize went to Sebastián Lelio’s A Fantastic Woman, a study of transgender self-assertion powered by the remarkable trans actress Daniela Vega the kudos fed directly into the starry publicity campaign for Lelio’s first English-language film Disobedience, a heady, well-received study of lesbian desire in the Orthodox Jewish community. Directors of queer stories get to move faster these days.There will be no awards attention for Love, Simon – perhaps the year’s most deceptively groundbreaking LGBT film – and for its purposes, that can be considered a badge of honour. Where the aforementioned films, for all their success, fall into a particular bracket of adult-targeted prestige cinema, Greg Berlanti’s bright teen comedy is Hollywood’s first gay romance aimed expressly at the multiplex audience: sweet, edgeless and sex-free, it’s a gay film that paradoxically feels progressive in its safeness, normalising the coming-out experience to the point of standard-issue adolescent soap opera. It didn’t set the box office alight, but it didn’t raise many eyebrows either. Already, it’s one of several teen-oriented US films this year to tackle the challenges of nascent homosexuality with a gentle, spry touch – among them Netflix’s peppy, John Hughes-referencing love triangle Alex Strangelove, in which our pretty, conflicted young hero considers the spectrum of sexual identification options available to his post-millennial generation before settling on good old-fashioned gayness.These films sit far from the range of LGBT experiences being portrayed on international screens: South Africa’s The Wound faced controversy on home turf for portraying a violent clash of masculine tribal tradition and contemporary queer identity, France’s 120 Beats Per Minute brought bracing eroticism and rhetorical vigour to its study of early-90s Aids activism, while in Britain, God’s Own Country impressed at the arthouse box office for delicately exploring homosexual yearning in the working-class hinterland. Always a broad umbrella of styles and viewpoints, LGBT cinema has branched out to such a degree that it’s increasingly nonsensical to regard it as a genre in itself: a Netflix-distributed youth romp, a broadly celebrated Oscar darling and an embattled African art film cannot be said to share a common creative church or commercial playing field. Yet if one thing does bind these disparate visions, beyond the “alternative” sexualities of their characters, it’s a mutual concern with the past – an urge to process centuries of persecution and internalised prejudice before looking ahead to whatever the future of queer identity might be. Many are period pieces, giving characters straitjacketed in the taboos and restrictions of their era the liberal allowances and understanding they didn’t necessarily feel then: the tightly buttoned, tentatively emerging midcentury rebels of Todd Haynes’ Carol and Far from Heaven the confused 1980s semi-hedonists of Call Me By Your Name, torn between domestic conventions and glimpses of new-wave cultural subversion the enraged campaigners of 120 Beats Per Minute, politically woken as a better 21st century looms but in a race to be heard before disease claims them. A rejoinder to more decorous historical portraits, Rupert Everett’s chaotic, sensual Oscar Wilde biopic The Happy Prince offers a modern, sympathetically queer reading of a character caught at least a century out a time. “Why should a perfectly ine leopard change his spots?” his Wilde asks – as do most of these films, wishing their characters into the more liberated present.Even the recent past is up for rearview speculation. Desiree Akhavan’s 1993-set The Miseducation of Cameron Post – the top prizewinner at this year’s Sundance festival – stars Chloë Grace Moretz as an insecure lesbian high-schooler surviving the horrors of gay conversion camp. It’s one of two films this year to examine the social and psychological damage wrought by such attempted therapy, still operational in America’s US Bible belt. The second, Joel Edgerton’s all-star directorial debut Boy Erased, is drawn from the horrifying memoir of the millennial-age writer and Baptist preacher’s son Garrard Conley. We know Conley’s story has a happy ending the fragile fictional teens of Akhavan’s film are brought to a less certain brink of escape and self-realisation, though it cautiously points to a brighter, freer future.Even contemporary-set, ostensibly new-generation LGBT films come with baggage to shed: the wholesome, jockish hero of Love, Simon may come out to general support from friends and family, but his long-closeted identity is dictated by outmoded constructs of masculinity. Some critics even questioned whether 46-year-old gay film-maker Berlanti’s film was inadvertently dated for its young, less inhibited audience – whether it was a coming-of-age story rooted more in his own childhood than that of a 21st-century boy. Until that generation (one younger even than 29-year-old Canadian Xavier Dolan, whose filmography has already covered a range of forthright, agitated gay viewpoints) starts filming its own LGBT narratives, it’ll be hard to gauge just how radically different the ruling queer perspective will be, though one imagines it will be governed less by prejudice than by possibility. At any rate, it will surely make swift, dust-gathering fossils of films like the forthcoming Steve Coogan-Paul Rudd vehicle Ideal Home, a generally well-meaning gay adoption comedy undermined by flouncy stereotyping.Notwithstanding such crass outliers, the LGBT cinema of the current moment is perhaps best regarded as a kind of truth and reconciliation inquiry for artists and audiences alike. It’s not as aggressive or inventive, perhaps, as the brasher, angrier queer cinema of decades past – we’re arguably not seeing a new John Waters or Gregg Araki on the frontline – but it is thoughtful, hopeful and socially conscious in its unpacking of personal experience and political adjustment across the expanding alphabet of queer identity. Like the cautiously united, emboldened lovers at the respective endings of Moonlight, Carol or God’s Own Country, LGBT cinema is either at the putting-to-bed stage or the going-to-bed stage. Let’s see what awaits in the morning.

It is also about the gravitational pull of death Campion quotes Thomas Hood’s 1827 poem Silence at the very end of the credits: “There is a silence where hath been no sound,  There is a silence where no sound may be,  In the cold grave – under the deep deep sea.” (Perhaps she was savouring the fact that these words would be shown to near-emptied cinemas.)I once found something over-literary in this film.

And for what it is worth, I believe Campion’s masterpiece is her less well known Bright Star, from 2009, with Ben Whishaw as John Keats. But a second viewing of The Piano allowed me to see how unique it is. And yes, there are literary qualities: it has echoes of Angela Carter and Peter Carey, but these only add to its intelligence and distinction. And there is a fierce performance from Holly Hunter, whose face radiates intensity and enigma.Maybe, above everything else, a re-evaluation of The Piano is about seeing how little of its backstory should be taken at face value. Hunter plays Ada, a 19th-century Scottish woman who has agreed to make the arduous journey to New Zealand to marry a colonist there: Alisdair Stewart, played by the reliably excellent Sam Neill. Ada has brought along her infant daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), and among the possessions that have to be brought on to the beach by near-mutinous Māori servants when she arrives is a baby grand piano. Ada is mute she uses sign language and writes notes – largely indignant orders and complaints – from a little pad and pencil strung around her neck. Her piano is a vital form of self-expression. Everything about Ada deeply disconcerts Alisdair, who declares that his servants cannot possibly transport this piano to their plantation.This is where his Scottish factotum comes in: Baines, played by Harvey Keitel, a man who affects Māori face markings and has, as they used to say, “gone native”. “Gone indigenous” doesn’t really convey the same imperialist flavour. Baines takes it upon himself to rescue the piano. He takes it to his own hut and asks Alisdair if he will consent to Ada giving him “lessons”. Bemused, trusting, glad of any way of appeasing his strange and angry bride, Alisdair agrees. In fact, Baines wants to watch her play, while in a state of progressive undress. His sexual obsession with her is soon requited, but the piano itself becomes a fetish, an occult symbol, generating the music of their secret love.So who is the father of Flora? Mother and daughter have a poignant consolatory fantasy about this man having been a German composer. It could be that Ada’s single-mother status was due to having once been respectably married and then widowed, and Ada does wear mourning black. This is what Alisdair believes, or wants to believe, knowing that, in the marriage market, he has little to offer but hardship. He may also assume Ada’s situation means she cannot afford to be squeamish about work and conjugal duties. But it is at least as possible that Ada has been raped – her own father’s culpability is not out of the question – and that her inability to speak is due to this. She says she lost her speech when she was six (roughly the age Flora is now) but that may not be true. We just have to ponder what has happened. The pain, and the grim determination with which the pain has been suppressed, give a force to the film.There are many extraordinary images: the piano itself, surreally marooned on the beach, is emblematic of the European imperial adventure. The amateur performance of Bluebeard by the white incomers, disrupted by its audience, is a bizarre and ominous episode. Ada’s final fainting in the mud and rain, her stark black dress ballooning up around her, makes her look like some dying sea monster, or a squid squirting out ink, or a ghost. Her love scenes with Baines are gamey and strange but also sensuous and moving. The fact that Baines’s nakedness is revealed to us well before Ada’s shows how unusual its depiction of sex is compared to most films, then as now. And Hunter’s performance is outstanding. So is the film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b93998c8815478083c0b904062aa35b4c1e3447/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3b58fb2e0f16b5918b2d4bb04893a2","title":"virtual reality vr film making documentaries face to face sheffield docfest","story":"Experience life as a blind person, play a customs officer or swim with sea otters. A new breed of VR film-making is making viewers engage in a deeper way with the issues they confrontSitting on a stool opposite me is Ayesha, a young American I’ve been asked to interrogate about her recent trip to Pakistan. “Did you visit any areas controlled by the Taliban?” I ask. “No, I did not,” she responds.Ayesha is a hologram, and I’m “playing” a US customs officer in an augmented reality experience called Terminal 3. I spend 15 minutes in my fictional airport, asking her questions based on choices that appear in writing in my field of vision. My voice triggers her responses – which start off clipped and defensive but become increasingly intimate – to the point where I feel like I’d really like to hang out with her. Ayesha is one of six participants of Muslim descent that were filmed with Depthkit technology to enable a surprisingly lifelike encounter that challenges stereotypes. It puts me in the position of authority – do I choose the tough questions or the softer ones? At the end I’m asked to decide whether to let her in to the country or detain her further. There’s a lot of hype around augmented reality at the moment but this piece – which came about after the director, Asad J Malik, had a bad experience with a customs officer in Abu Dhabi – had a narrative thrust that felt different to what’s gone before. You could imagine this sort of encounter happening in your own home in the not too distant future. It was one of many immersive installations at Sheffield DocFest’s Alternate Realities programme, which featured 27 interactive and immersive projects including films, games and web projects. Experiences ranged from Gabo Arora and Saschka Unseld’s The Day the World Changed, a room-scale experience that bears witness to Hiroshima survivors and makes a powerful case for nuclear disarmament, to Martin Hertig’s playful Sensible Data  Mixed Emotions installation, in which three machines translate a selfie into a real-time drawing of your face accompanied by an email revealing your age, gender, “beauty levels” and mood – a witty comment on personal data collection.Dan Tucker, programmer for Alternate Realities, ided offerings into two strands: The World Unknown to You – installations with impact that take you to places that are hard to access or imagine – and Better Known Truths – 360-degree films experienced in a headset. Housed this year in Trafalgar Warehouse, a suitably grungy industrial building, the exhibition was free. I chatted to a lady in her 70s who’d returned over several days and was amazed that this sort of storytelling existed.Many of the 360 films I saw seemed to have finally dispensed with the idea of “taking you into someone else’s world” by simply placing a static camera in a location. Grenfell: Our Home, made by the indie production company Parable, filmed and interviewed a group of survivors in stereoscopic 360. Rather than dwell on the well-trodden news lines, the piece is about their homes in the tower, with their plants, artefacts and hand-drawn murals sensitively reimagined through animation. Benoît Felici’s The Real Thing is a charming film set in the Chinese towns of Suzhou and Tianducheng, where replicas of famous European landmarks – including Venice’s canals, Tower Bridge and the Eiffel Tower – exist. The surreal 360 journeys through these towns are complemented by first-hand stories from people who live there, such as the photographer who muses on what it might be like to live in the “real” European city while photographing Chinese couples in their wedding attire. Face to Face, commissioned by the festival and winner of the alternate realities virtual reality award, was an extraordinary three-room experience involving the shocking story of Michelle Fox who, in 2009, was injured in a near-fatal gun accident caused by her ex-husband. She lost her eyes, nose and upper palate and now wears a silicone facial prosthetic made specially for her. The photojournalist Michelle Gabel had been documenting her life since 2014 and was then introduced to Michaela Holland, an immersive storyteller who collaborated with them on this piece. Each room in the installation is based on spaces from Fox’s home. The first is a living room, where I’m invited to spend 15 minutes absorbing her world. The walls are lined with family photographs, kids’ drawings and cuddly toys. The TV streams old home movies of her: dancing with her toddler, at a birthday party, playing dress-up with her daughter – all pre-accident. But in a drawer is a police witness statement from her friend Rebecca, describing what happened on the day of the accident. It’s gut-wrenching, visceral and heartbreaking. In the second room, a blue bathroom, I’m told to choose a facial “prosthetic”. These are in fact bespoke 3D-printed VR headsets with faces of different skin tones – there are seven or eight to choose from, and I duly reach for one that matches mine. When I don the headset, I see Michelle standing at her bathroom mirror, a bandana around her upper face, preparing to put her prosthetic on. The 360 film voiced by her shows moments of her daily life interwoven with animation and photographs. We glimpse what being blind has been like for her – like the fact that her daughter will forever remain as a five-year-old in her mind’s eye. What happens in the final room (a dining space) catches me off guard – although I won’t give the surprise away since Face to Face will hopefully be shown in other venues.Traumatic events and memories was a theme in the exhibition, although Life in VR: California Coast offered welcome relief. A stunning CGI interactive experience from BBC Studios, it explored underwater ecosystems from microscopic creatures to sea otters and the humpback whale – a virtual Blue Planet that enabled you to swim with these creatures. This is VR that encapsulates the BBC’s core mission to inform, educate and entertain. As with many of the works showing at Sheffield DocFest, it suggests that virtual reality is becoming ever more complex, rich and thought-provoking.

The France squad feature several far greener players – such as Kylian Mbappé, Thomas Lemar, Ousmane Dembélé and Corentin Tolisso – who excel at top clubs but who have yet to sample a major tournament. Matuidi says that with the second-youngest squad out of the 32 competing nations in Russia, France will need their seasoned campaigners, as well as the manager, to help spread serenity, even if they are edged out of the starting lineup, as Matuidi may be by the 23-year-old Tolisso.“The World Cup is a level above and for a lot of the players this will be their first,” says the 31-year-old Matuidi. “It’s important to have talented players but you need experienced ones, too. We have some, including myself. We have a nice mix. Being fresh to these things can be an asset but we also have to be on our guard. That’s the role of us older ones, to try to transmit calmness.“Having said that, although the new players are young, they are already very mature. Take Kylian Mbappé, for example. He’s only 19 but he’s very intelligent, very mature and surrounds himself with good people.”At least there seems little risk of French in-fighting this time. Didier Deschamps, who took over in the wake of rank and rancorous displays at the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European Championship, has strived to foster a wholesome atmosphere, shunning players whose influence he apparently does not consider to be positive, most notably Karim Benzema.It helps that Deschamps has an array of other high-class options to call on. France have so much quality that over-confidence would be understandable, especially given a favourable group draw alongside Australia, Peru and Denmark. But there is no risk of complacency taking root.“When people say they think we can go far in the tournament, I say ‘We think so, too’,” Matuidi says. “Confidence is good but too much is dangerous. We are well aware that this is going to be a tough competition and other teams will be waiting for us, working on ways to snuff out our strengths. We certainly don’t underestimate the size of the challenge we face. But at the same time, I don’t envy any other team. We have players of huge quality in every position.”France’s biggest problem may be that Deschamps has yet to show he has found the best way to combine those players into an all-conquering team. While he has generated a united spirit, the paradox of Deschamps’ reign is that in six years he has yet to imbue his side with a clear method and iron resolve, the qualities for which he has been synonymous since his glorious playing days.France were inconsistent throughout the qualifiers and hinted at fragility even during the friendlies, such as when they frittered away a two-goal lead before losing 3-2 at home to Colombia in March or when they struggled to a 1-1 draw with the USA last weekend. They have a tendency to alternate between brilliance and stodginess. There are question marks about the formation and lineup Deschamps will use when France open their campaign against Australia on Saturday.Matuidi says Deschamps’ first two tournaments as manager brought progress and the team could be ripening at exactly the right time.“We did very well in the last two competitions,” he says. “The manager did some great things. He took over at a complicated time after 2012 and he got everyone together and put us on the right path. In 2014 we went out in the quarter-finals to the eventual champions, which was pretty good for a team in renewal. And we got to the final of Euro 2016. Yes, we could have won it but that’s football. Let’s hope we’re going to reach the crescendo this year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a53b7bb3db2bc44d37a44d21498e40209912fba4/49_168_858_515/master/858.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0557224aa17bef0db1e8325cbd4968ed","title":"christian eriksen making of denmark tottenham","story":"Coaches who have worked with the Denmark midfielder explain what makes him so special – and how he needed a kick up the backside to go from good to greatThe first thing that strikes a visitor to Middelfart Boldklub is the sheer number of pitches. There is plenty of space to learn football here, in this affluent spot plum in the centre of Denmark, but there has to be the appetite, too. Around 600 youngsters aged between five and 17, taken from a wider community of around 37,000, are currently signed on and, if the number seems high, it is not exactly a hard sell these days. “The name means something now,” says Claus Hansen, the chairman. “When kids start playing football they think: ‘Christian Eriksen is from Middelfart – I want to play at Middelfart too.’”Hansen is speaking inside the smart, modest red-brick clubhouse, standing in front of a wall that displays shirts signed, at various points in his career, by his club’s most famous son. It is March and, by coincidence, the night Eriksen and Denmark will face Panama in a pre-World Cup friendly. The room will be packed as always, eyes transfixed on the television opposite, just as it is, Hansen says proudly, whenever Tottenham are on air.On the way in a visitor must walk past the first pitch a five-year-old Eriksen ever used – these days a haphazardly kept quadrangle with small-sided goals dotted around. It was, at first, a well-trodden path. Three decades before him Hansen had begun kicking a ball around on the same turf, progressing to play for Middelfart’s first team alongside Eriksen’s father, Thomas.“A good player, skilful, played on the left side and made a lot of goals,” Hansen remembers of Thomas, a car parts salesman who still lives a few hundred metres away, the family home only just out of sight beyond the fields to the back. Christian would watch the senior side play – “When we came off he would always say, ‘You were good today,’ even when we lost” – but the realisation that he would, soon enough, become a cut above most others who tried their luck in a town much better known for its links to the oil industry came quickly.“We have a lot of good kids but nobody like Christian: when he was small, everyone could see that he was special,” says Hansen, a jocular man with a ready laugh. “More than that, he was the guy who took care of all the others. He was the best player from the start but he’d never say it. Christian was, and still is, a good boy – nice, polite, friendly.”The Eriksens’ bond was close. Thomas was one of Christian’s coaches and success was never far away. In 2004 Middelfart’s under‑12 side finished fifth in the whole of Denmark that year his age group also finished unbeaten in the local championship of Funen – the country’s middle island – for the third time in four years. “We try and teach them that it’s nice to have the ball, nice to do something with it that can get us quickly to the other goal,” says Hansen, pointing to a list of “Blue Lines” that spell out the 70-year-old club’s history. “We are playing forwards, not backwards.”Eriksen was moving in that direction, too. “He was the best technical player I have ever seen, quite unique,” says Anders Skjoldemose, sitting in an office at the training ground of Odense BK. “But he was a team player too. Everyone could see he was the best inidual but he was just as much the best at working for the team.”These days Skjoldemose works in the top-flight club’s commercial department but in 2005, when a 13-year-old Eriksen made the 30-mile journey from Middelfart, he was at the heart of their youth operation. “Middelfart always have one or two players who are good enough,” he says, and that year they were Eriksen and his close friend Rasmus Falk, who now plays for FC Copenhagen. The pair came as a well-established double act.Tonny Hermansen, the current head of Odense’s academy and a former coach of Eriksen at regional level, remembers a match between Middelfart Under-12s and their rivals TPI in which the latter were 4-0 up at half-time. Within 20 minutes of the second half TPI, who included Hermansen’s son, were 8-4 down. “Christian and Rasmus just got on the ball, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, played it between them, put it in, took the ball and started again,” he says. “They made all the goals. If you ask the guys that played at the time, they still remember.”Things continued in a similar vein at Odense, where their age group would win the national title in 2006. Skjoldemose, who coached them directly at under-16 level, quickly noticed “some kind of magical atmosphere around that team”, Eriksen’s seriousness and maturity setting him apart. “He was invited to trials abroad at places like Chelsea and Milan,” he says. “When he got back the guys in the dressing room would go: ‘How was it in Milan?’ but he’d just say, ‘Yeah, it was OK. Are you ready for another session now?’ Every other kid would have been walking in the sky.”Out on Odense’s pitch No 1, Eriksen would score free-kick after free-kick, rinse and repeat. Sitting next to Skjoldemose, Hermansen reaches for his laptop and pulls up footage from a technical skills DVD he made for the Danish FA in 2005, one that is still shown in seminars around the continent today. It showcases one star pupil in particular. “His touch on the ball – 13 years old!” he exclaims, as if watching Eriksen for the first time, as the youngster passes and dribbles, but the most familiar-looking piece of footage is of a technically perfect set piece, curled into the corner of the goal. Six of his 41 goals in the Premier League have come that way and there is a thrill in seeing the past presage the future so unmistakably.Morten Olsen first watched Eriksen play in November 2009, two months before his promotion to the Ajax first-team squad. Denmark’s under-17s were playing a friendly against France and Olsen, nearly a decade into his 15-year stint as the senior national team’s coach, found himself transfixed.“After five minutes watching, I might as well have gone home,” he tells the . “He was playing against a very physically strong side but the technique, the mentality, everything was obvious straightaway. From the beginning he was what I call a ‘wow’ footballer.” By the following March Eriksen was in Olsen’s squad three months after that he would be the youngest player at the World Cup in South Africa, appearing against the Netherlands and Japan.His path towards becoming the country’s footballing fulcrum was set, although there was the occasional bump in the road. If there was one thing lacking in Eriksen, his coaches at Odense had thought, it was a dose of fire and brimstone his way from the very beginning had been to let the ball speak but Olsen thought that, playing for Denmark, that was lending itself too much to passivity. In October 2014 he fiercely reproached Eriksen after a Euro 2016 qualifying defeat by Portugal, saying the player was not managing to control games and that this was “not Ajax any more … not development”.“He’s the only guy in the national team I have criticised as much as that after a game,” Olsen says. “Normally I do it indoors but I said to myself that he could live with it – and that he had to live with it. Because of the kind of player he is, he needed to learn to live with the responsibility. Some people said I was too hard but at the time I had to press another button on Christian Eriksen, knowing the human being and the footballer.”It was a carefully calculated kick up the backside. In Eriksen’s next 20 internationals he scored 15 goals, including the hat-trick in Dublin that in effect took Denmark to the World Cup. These days the team’s style, under the current coach, Age Hareide, is designed to put him in areas where he can hurt opponents to a degree none of his peers can match. “Even on a bad day Christian would run 13 or 14km for the team,” Olsen says. “So we can never really say he played a poor game. If he and the team can find form together, I think Denmark can surprise in Russia.”Whether or not they do, Eriksen will almost certainly be back in Middelfart later this summer, staying with his parents and dropping in on old friends. He will see the pitch Middelfart Boldklub constructed with the £35,000 they received on his move from Ajax to Tottenham perhaps he will also pass by his old school, Lillebælt, whose “Cruyff Court” bears his name and was bequeathed during his time in the Ereisie. An unassuming town and its equally demure offspring have served one another well.“It would be great to have one like him every 10 years but nobody can promise that,” Hansen says. The regret is a trifling one at most his club has already delivered a talent for the ages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb1749b4f4e7e4a38356a2890fc620bb190598f/0_196_3464_2078/master/3464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecf74fcf3620f6778e1cfedd95b75df0","title":"football quiz who am i","story":"Who hit four goals for a losing side?

But a rough time in the Premier League this past season has raised question about his futureThere is not too much shame in being unable to remember your 30th birthday celebrations and Javier ‘Chicharito’ Hernández might wish the same fate had befallen him when his international teammates helped him mark the milestone this month. Their night out in Mexico City became subject to the kind of salacious rumors that can ruin a World Cup buildup Hernández strongly denied a tabloid claim that escorts were present at the event and that particular storm appears to have blown over – at least until any on-pitch mishaps surface around El Tri.Something that will not go away quite as easily is the issue of Hernández’s form. The West Ham striker has deific status in his home country and it would take much more than a late night to change that. The problem is that, if a key inidual should ideally play his way into form just in time for football’s biggest event, there has been little sign of that happening. It has been a damaging 12 months for Hernández, who said upon returning to the Premier League that he wanted to “show I can achieve the things I dream of”. Eight goals in 33 appearances for the Hammers, only 19 of them in starts, was a stark departure from his coruscating form at Bayern Leverkusen. And although there are plenty of mitigating factors there is an argument that his days as an irreplaceable totem may be coming to an end – as all good things eventually do.“I don’t see people blaming Chicharito for the move to West Ham,” Sergio Tristan of Pancho Villa’s Army, the high-profile Mexico supporters’ group, tells the . “I see people blaming West Ham for not utilising him properly. Bringing David Moyes in after signing a player like Chicharito was a catastrophic mistake, one that Chicharito has no blame in.“It was a lost opportunity for him. He could have done so much better somewhere else, where they would have appreciated him. Most of us hope he leaves West Ham and goes to Spain or back to Germany.”Billboards and television commercials in Mexico continue to showcase the nation’s favorite son, as they have for many years now. “We learned he’s a PR icon and that’s what we’re doing with him now,” the Bayer Leverkusen CEO, Michael Schade, said in 2016, albeit stressing that Hernández’s goal-scoring came first. The Bundesliga club sold 12,000 replica shirts in Mexico in the month after releasing a new kit that July. Twelve months before that, 5,000 had flown off the shelves during a winter appearance at the Florida Cup in Orlando the club’s Spanish-language Twitter following mushroomed and, for a time, Hernández’s inability to do any wrong back home provided the key to an untapped market.Whether the same will hold true wherever he plays next season depends largely on what comes to pass over the next month. “Chucky Lozano is the next big star and will be the leader of this team going forward,” Tristan says of Hirving Lozano, the 22-year-old PSV winger whose temper seems the only obstacle to a big move, perhaps one broadly in Hernández’s footsteps, after the World Cup. Jesus ‘Tecacito’ Corona of Porto is also coming up on the tracks and a changing of the guard is inevitable.“He will be the tireless sacrificial striker,” Tristan predicts of Hernández’s role in Russia, which he believes will involve creating space for the wide men around him. “I expect Mexico to reach the final. He will have one important game winner in the knockout stages. This will be the culmination of Chicharito as a player and he will enjoy every second of it.”That birthday party, and the year of Premier League stagnation that preceded it, will seem entirely irrelevant should those events come to pass."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e169ee30d2499de2b6310356cd98c8c8bf4633d0/0_112_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bac7f2e36ff3e7ac27d9a8564ae0bda5","title":"leeds united appoint marcelo bielsa head coach","story":"Marcelo Bielsa has insisted it was “impossible to turn down” Leeds United after the Argentian was confirmed on Friday as the Championship club’s new head coach on an initial two‑year contract.After weeks of negotiations with the club’s chairman, Andrea Radrizzani, the former Argentina manager has agreed a deal until 2020 with the option of extending it by a further year. Bielsa replaces Paul Heckingbottom, who was sacked this month.“I am delighted to accept the role,” the 62-year-old Bielsa said. “It has always been my ambition to work in England and I have had several opportunities to do so during my career, however I have always felt it was important to wait for the right project to come along.“When a club with Leeds’ history made me an offer, it was impossible to turn down. I am excited for the challenge ahead as we work hard to achieve great things.”Bielsa, who led Argentina at the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea and also took charge of Chile in 2010, has been out of work since being sacked by Lille last year. But despite his “El Loco” nickname he is renowned as a tactical innovator, with Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola, Mauricio Pochettino of Tottenham and Atlético Madrid’s Diego Simeone all citing him as a huge influence on their careers.“My admiration for Marcelo Bielsa is huge,” said Guardiola, who spent time with him in 2006 before becoming a manager. “He makes the players much, much better and he helped me a lot with his advice.”Marcelo Bielsa\u0027s last two managerial appointments – at Lazio and Lille – lasted just 15 games in total, and he Leeds\u0027s 11th manager since Simon Grayson departed in 2012.Yet with Leeds set to start a fifth successive season with a new manager in charge having laboured to 13th in the Championship table last season, Bielsa will certainly have his work cut out at Elland Road. The highly rated England Under-21 defender Tom Pearce signed a new deal last week despite interest from Everton, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace, while the Sweden defender Pontus Jansson has also been linked with a move away.A lack of English could also be an problem for Bielsa, who has managed clubs in Spain, France and Italy. He also won Olympic gold with Argentina in 2004 and memorably led a free‑flowing Athletic Bilbao side to the Europa League final in 2013.Spells at Lazio and in Ligue 1 were less successful, with his stay in Rome lasting only two days and Lille struggling to avoid relegation after winning just three matches.Nonetheless, Radrizzani admitted he was prepared to take a gamble as the Italian bids to take Leeds back to the Premier League for the first time since 2004. “He is a coach that I have admired for many years and when the opportunity arose to bring him here, we made it our top priority,” he said.“Marcelo has a wealth of experience and he will use that to create a new culture and a winning mentality at our football club.”Bielsa fits Leeds’s stated aim to bring in an experienced coach, after a run of unsuccessful appointments. He is their 11th manager since 2012, and will reportedly earn £2m a year, making him their highest-paid manager.The new coach’s first confirmed fixture will be a home tie against Bolton in the Carabao Cup first round.

Asked whether they sent her to sleep she said: “They give me peace I\u0026nbsprecover faith.”Many Argentinians derive faith from watching Lionel Messi play: “Messi is the first genius of the 21st century,” Jorge Valdano tells me, “and the last bridge between the street and the academy. If for Maradona the ball was a musical instrument, for Messi it’s a tool which he utilises with a stunning sense of efficacy.”“Messi is two, three players at once,” Javier Mascherano once said, and he recently clarified for me what he means: “Conceptually, Leo does what in other teams you need three players to do: he takes care of creating play, finishing and assisting all at the same time.”Messi’s stats are a testament to this he has surpassed most on goals scored but also in terms of assists. Mascherano thinks the constant improvement makes Messi all the more spectacular: “He is continually in ascendant evolution – year after year he becomes a better player.”On-field genius comes with an off‑pitch low profile that has rendered him enigmatic to say the least. He rarely says much and when he does it is hardly amazing. The writer John Carlin once said that having interviewed Messi twice, if he were offered him again he would refuse. “Shy,” everyone says, and almost as often the reference comes with “not so much shy as introverted”. What is unarguable is that Messi’s savant qualities exist. And that is what is of interest.After Argentina achieved second place at the 2014 World Cup, playing every minute of the tournament with every fibre of their beings, there was a hideous backlash back home dwelling on the mistakes, the could-have-beens, the ifs and the buts. The cross Messi has to bear for being Argentinian but not having won a major trophy for the nation is as unbearable as it is ridiculous.The dichotomy between club and country is the single most referred-to question thrown my way when it comes to Messi, ever since he sat on the bench as an unused substitute in 2006, sulking while Argentina went out to Germany. How come he delivers so much for Barcelona and so little for Argentina? Is it Andrés Iniesta? He doesn’t sing the national anthem was one of the criticisms. And he never played in his own country’s first ision.A perception has been voiced that somehow he is sometimes a ravenous winner (for Barcelona) and other times a disconnected outsider who does not feel the emotion of the strip (for Argentina). The author Andrés Burgo disputes this. “There was never a ravenous Messi and another disconnected one: he was always ravenously disconnected,” he wrote in 2015. That came after the 2014 “fiasco” was followed by Messi leading Argentina to another final, the Copa América, where they lost against Chile.Ravenous, disconnected, introverted and somehow remarkably “one more in the team” and “just a normal guy” – quite a feat for probably the most famous guy in the world. “You’re better known than Coca-Cola,” the political journalist Luis Majul told him a few months ago in an interview aired in Argentina and Messi laughed. Why? Was it the fact itself or the nature of the comparison that cracked him up? Majul asked, as if talking to a child (because interviewers talk to him as if he is a child): “What are you laughing at? It’s true.” The reply was a shrug, an “I don’t know”, some sort of “I never think about myself in those terms” thing.A more recent interview with the popular football programme Líbero visited Messi’s personal museum of balls, trophies and football shirts – the shirts signed by former team‑mates, rivals, legends. He shows off Iniesta’s, the most recent addition: “I never asked him for his shirt before, because I was still enjoying him,” he said now that Iniesta has left Barcelona he dared ask. “You are the number one, there is no one like you,” Iniesta’s message says.Huge efforts from the Messi brand are being poured into highlighting that he gives these interviews to Argentinian media. The view that Messi has matured – now that he is a father – and adopted leadership skills, that he is more sure of himself and dares be who he wants to be, is further illustrated by his relatively new image. “The ornamental beard, so in vogue, so ex‑con,” was the cynical take from the professional social provocateur Esteban Schmidt in Argentina. The Beckham-style tattoos (at least one of which has been removed) present a more masculine, muscular Messi. Gone is the shy antisocial Messi in comes the new leader.“In spite of media efforts to Maradonise him, he really doesn’t pick players, select squads, or dictate formations or lineups,” said a source from within team Messi to counter rumours rife in Argentina. Much was made of the fact that in a friendly against Spain in March, when he asked not to play because of muscle fatigue, he went into the dressing room at half-time to give the pep talk. At Brazil 2014, after an initial defensive formation, apparently Messi sent word to the coach, Alejandro Sabella, that the players weren’t happy, and a more offensive lineup reigned henceforth.We can track rumours of the modus operandi back years allegedly he texted managers with his tactical critique from the bus after a match, seats away from the manager. He is more comfortable texting than speaking. Juan Sebastián Verón claimed that the only time he saw him nervous enough to lose sleep (Messi sleeps on average a couple of hours more than most athletes, including a sacred afternoon nap) was when he had to speak to the squad as captain in 2010. Verón said Messi paced the room they shared anxiously.Messi’s phone is his friend. To the point that on the friendly tour of Manchester and Madrid it was leaked that he sat, head hung low, staring at the screen even at mealtimes that younger players in awe dared not approach. His longstanding osteopath of yesteryear José Brau said: “The way to understand him is to watch his body language: when his head is down it’s as if he was putting up a Do\u0026nbspNot\u0026nbspDisturb sign.”Sometimes his head appears to be low on the pitch and he goes on to score some impossible goal and it is on the pitch that we should observe him. “A genetic miracle,” Fernando Signorini told me. Signorini has worked as a trainer with footballers for as long as he can remember and was in charge of Argentina’s physical coaching at the 2010 World Cup. “Just like Diego, his neuromuscular coordination has a cosmic power. Almost unthinkable ability to control their body in time and space, defying gravity. At maximum speed, he can take two steps with the same leg and the ball. I’ve tried to do it on sand and I couldn’t. Leo and Diego do it routinely, at high velocity, surrounded by the greatest players in the world trying to stop them. That’s how I would define his\u0026nbspgenius.”The challenge then is to create the environment that will best enable him to thrive. Successive Argentina managers have spent inordinate amounts of time not only meeting Messi on regular trips to Barcelona but questioning Pep Guardiola, the coach widely regarded as having got the best out of him. Guardiola is said to have told Sabella: “Speak to him the bare minimum, only when absolutely necessary.”Martín remembers Guardiola showing him video footage he would put in front of Messi accompanied by light hints. “What do you think if we try this?” Or: “It seems to me that we could have an opportunity if we did that\u0026nbsp…”“Suggest,” Guardiola says. And let him be.Jorge Sampaoli has also been briefed by Guardiola. Argentina’s coach seems to be cracking the Messi enigma. Sources close to the footballer say he was very pleased after their first meeting, because they “only spoke about football”. It is in keeping with Guardiola’s stance to stick to the subject.The anguish Messi feels when he loses is clear. The image of him sobbing in the arms of Mascherano after defeat in one final, the surprise retirement from international football after another (he was lured back) are indicative of a frustration bordering on the unbearable.But the absurdity of the burden the national flag represents subjects him to constant backlash – his every utterance turned against him in the most unexpected ways. “Do you feel you owe the World Cup to the Argentinian people,” he was asked. “We owe it to ourselves,” Messi replied.A barrage of manufactured controversy ensued: Messi does not feel indebted to the nation. A traitor, motivated by the deep Qatari-sponsored coffers of Barcelona more than by the glorious emotive weight of the national strip.The sports psychologist Marcelo Roffé, who worked with Messi’s generation of players at youth level, said it wasn’t Maradona who is ill – Argentinian society is ill. “How can a person be psychologically prepared to tolerate the ‘poison’ of success?” he said. “It’s not easy.”Messi has enjoyed his football more with Barcelona. The familiarity with his team-mates and his surroundings notwithstanding, perhaps he really is a creature of habit. He apparently likes order and is himself very ordered Argentina maybe throws just that little bit more chaos his way than he can handle. Unlike Maradona, who thrived on conflict and feeds off opposition, Messi seems to need cooperation in order to succeed. He functions best as part of a well-oiled machine. It’s difficult to match that concept with Argentina, on any level.Plenty of Argentinians are football lovers in the purest sense, content to share the fact that we are from the same country as Messi and satisfied with the joy he has given. “I love you just the way you are without cups or trophies” Alejandro Wall titled a feature-length ode of gratitude, voicing the feeling of millions. But plenty more, and perhaps the media are more guilty of this than most, still feel something is incomplete.Mascherano told me Messi has a conditioning effect on the collective performance. He also believes Messi’s best version depends on the team and Messi seems to echo this, always claiming he wins nothing alone.Maradona won a World Cup for Argentina practically single‑handedly, but at a cost. To himself and perhaps the collective ego of the nation.“This has to be very clearly stated: Messi is not Maradona whether we like it or not,” Roffé has said. “As Argentines, we have done a lot of damage to Maradona. We can’t stop consuming him, as if he was a substance. Let’s hope with Messi we learn to modify our behaviour.”This is almost certainly Messi’s last chance to win a World Cup so the onus and pressure are on the other 22 players. Are they up to the task of helping the genius emerge triumphant? Will anything change if they do? Discussing Messi’s fantastic maturity and fitness level, Sampaoli was asked whether this was “Messi’s World Cup”. He replied: “This one, the next one, and the one after that.” It is not as if he is going to play until he is 50, came the retort from the floor, to which Sampaoli replied: “I\u0026nbspdon’t\u0026nbspknow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d8f611a95c21e193a0170cc980a014762224676/0_111_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19867d91f464342aab182fda676ddac8","title":"world cup fiver the worst opening day performance since diana ross","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!At the time of writing Saudi Arabia have not withdrawn from the Ethics World Cup despite disgracing themselves with the worst opening-day performance since Diana Ross tried to take a penalty. Ross is 74 now and still a woman so Saudi authorities are unlikely to listen to any advice she may have to give apparently, then, Team Saudi are going to keep plugging away at this football lark, which is good news for Luis Suárez and – eventually, once he comes on – Mohamed Salah, who could effectively have the Golden Boot in the bag before the conclusion of the group stage.“Results like this don’t happen very often in World Cups,” conceded Saudi Arabia manager Juan Antonio Pizzi. “We need to recover from this shameful situation,” added Pizzi, stopping short of suggesting that hiring a new manager might be a good start on the evidence of Thursday’s shambles. Though he did admit: “The opposing team really didn’t have to make a huge effort to win this game … but I trust my efforts, I trust my players and I fully trust we’ll have a better performance in the next game.”History, at least, suggests that might be the case. After losing 10-1 in the first match in the 1982 World Cup, El Salvador performed respectably in their next two matches, going down only 1-0 to Belgium and 2-0 to Argentina. And Zaire’s 9-0 shellacking by Yugoslavia in 1974 amounted to an impressive face-saving exercise after a first game in which they were beaten by Scotland. And, of course, when Saudi Arabia were trounced 8-0 by Germany in 2002, they recovered sufficiently to lose only 1-0 to Cameroon and 3-0 to the Republic O’Ireland. The thing is, of course, that El Salvador and Zaire had some genuinely ingenious players and several mitigating factors for their heavy defeats, and even the Saudi side of 2002 looked better than the current shower, who, as things stand, must be hailed at the lamest outfit ever to appear at the World Cup. All that can really save them now is for some clown to start lobbying for the World Cup to be expanded to include 48 countries. What?

He spins his man in the box and is through on goal. But Elshenaway rushes off his line to close him down smartly. Suarez looked like he was expecting the keeper to over-commit but he didn’t. 72 min: A counter-attack by Egypt is ended by a wild foul .. bu the ref waves play on because the balls runs to Fathi, who lets fly with a ferocious drive from over 20 yards. And the keeper catches it well. Note: catches it, not cops out by punch it away.69 min: A weak corner makes it as far as Cavani short of the near post. Cavani tries to turn and get off a shot but he’s crowded out by about five players. 67 min: “So, Uruguay are being frustrated by a team playing better football than them and Suarez is utterly frustrated,” notes Gokul Kannan. “I think we all know what comes next. Sinking his teeth into Salah’s shoulder in the 80th minute and then going on to score the winner?” Well, Salah hasn’t come on yet. And it’s a pickle as to whether Cuper should introduce him: victory is there, you feel, is it worth the risk?64 min: Suarez gets the ball to the left of the box. He tries to cross but it’s blocked. it rebounds to him. And then he’s pestered into losing it. The message from this game so far is forget about Suarez and Cavani, what’s needed is a Uruguayan Mark Wright (one for lovers of Italia ‘90 there, folks). Egypt substitution: Mohsen off and on comes Sal...no, only joshing, it’s Kahraba, but he’s nicknamed Electricity so be might bring a spark.Uruguay substitution: Rodriguez on, De Arrascaeta off. Let’s see if the double change sparks Uruguay into action. Egypt have had their number so far.58 min: Excellent work by Trezeguet, winning back the ball with a strong challenge and then going on a winding run forward. But he eventually runs into trouble. 55 min: Egypt are dictating the tempo now and enjoying a lot of possession, knocking the ball about and forcing Uruguay to sit deep. Trezeguet, probing down the left, has hinted at penetration but not really carried through yet. It’s tight.52 min: Egypt have responded to that injection of vim by Uruguay early in the second half. So this remains a tight and intense battle.Egypt substitution: Hamed has to come off and is replaced by Sam Morsy, the Wolverhampton-born midfielder who plays for Wigan and is now a World Cup star.48 min: Hamed is lying on his back in midfield. He’s in obvious pain after receiving a knee in the lower back from De Arrascaeta during a challenge. Accidental, no doubt. it does not look like Hamed will be able to continue. 46 min: No changes in personnel during the break, but a marked change in Uruguay’s tempo: within 45 seconds of the resumption Cavani slips in Suarez for a chance. Nothing wrong with the striker’s shot on the run this time, but ElShenawy makes a fine save! An unscrupulous man would suggest Uruguay should kick someone to wake themselves up. There’ll certainly be angry words exchanged during the interval because the South Americans have been oddly subdued. Some credit for that must go to Egypt, who have been dynamic and well organised. Cuper does not look capable of winning simply because they have been blunt up front: but they do have Salah on the bench ...45 min: A skilful flourish by De Arrascaeta in midfield bu the ensuing cross by Uruguay is way off the mark. They’re been strangely off-colour so far, almost dozy.43 min: Egypt launch a promising attack. But their final ball into the box twice lets them down.42 min: Cavani drops deep into his own half to appeal for a pass. That’s been a common sight so far, lovely for Egypt to see.40 min: Warda gets helped up by the referee after claiming to hurt his back following a fresh-air-overhead kick. 38 min: Godin makes a break from the back, gliding past one opponent before slipping the ball through to De Arrascaeta, who lets the ball run away from him in the Egyptian bo,x, much to the annoyance of Godin. Apparently De Arrascaeta - first name Giorgian - was named after a horse, but his touch there was that of a donkey.36 min: Uruguay try to exert pressure again. But as soon as they get anywhere near the Egyptian box they can find no openings and no inspiration.34 min: Egypt take up residence deep in the Uruguayan half. The threat from them is growing as they look to have more energy and more precision than Uruguay. So far there’s been no sign of sharpness up front from them, however. But they’ve been the better team so far, no doubt.32 min: Freekick to Uruguay, 30 yards out. Suarez reckons this is the time for his luck to change But he curls the short straight into the wall.30 min: Fathy nicks the ball off Suarez as Uruguay threatened to mount an attack. Suarez looks furious with himself: he’s just can’t get going today.29 min: Elneny has begun well here but has just given the ball away with a stray pass. No matter, Egypt win it back again. They’re starting to make Uruguay look sluggish. Tabarez is looking very agitated on the sideline.27 min: Mohsen does well to win a long punt from the keeper. He lays the ball back to Warda and then spins and receives it back again. His resultant shot through a couple of defender lacks power but is on target, at least, and forces Muslera to make his first save of the game. 25 min: An outswinging corner from the right runs all the way over to Suarez, who tries to sweep it into the net from six yards. He finds the net all right and the Uruguayan fans rejoice ... not realising it was the sidenetting! Suarez holds his mouth to stifle a naughty word. That was a bad miss: for the second time in the game, he did not connect cleanly with a shot. 24 min: Cavani hits a bouncing ball goalward from the edge of the area. Hegazi gets in the way. 23 min: De Arrascaeta curls in a corner for Uruguay. El Shenaway punches it clear.21 min: Bentancur gets caught in possession in midfield. He is one of the players expected to provide Suarez and Cavani with better service than they got at the last World Cup, but he has been smothered well by dynamic Egypt so far.19 min: El Said gets a lecture for ing over the leg of Caceres as Egypt tried to infiltrate the Uruguayan box. He should have been booked for that. The VAR official will have to retrospectively admonish the ref at half-time.16 min: Freekick to Egypt, about 27 yards out and central. The big men come up from the back. El Said drifts the freekick towards Hegazi, but Uruguay head it away.13 min: The big screen in the stadium shows Salah sitting on the bench. The crowd goes wild. A born entertainer. 12 min: Uruguay work Varela into space down the right wing. The former Manchester United winger pulls back a low cross to Suarez, who had held his run. But Suarez doesn’t catch his shot right and it wobbles several yards wide from a difficult angle.10 min: It’s tight. Egypt are compact and energetic without the ball and tidy with it. Uruguay have yet to find any kind of inspiration and, indeed, are probably spending more time chasing the ball than anticipated. “It’s a mixed bag today for my mate SuperKev.,” reveals Steve Monkey. “His toddler nearly took his eye out in a nappy-changing incident last night but he has been signed off work for a week and at least gets to watch all the games through his one good eye. And the eye patch makes him look like a pirate. Give him a shout out will you.”8 min: Cavani receives the ball with his back to goal, about 25 yards out. He spins and gets off a shot, but Shenawy saves his low effort. 7 min: Hegazi makes two interceptions in quick succession as Uruguay try to release Suarez with passes from deep. Otherwise, it’s quite a comfortable start for Egypt.4 min: When they get the ball Egypt are trying to be constructive with it, not jut boot it away. Technically tidy, they’re enjoying a spell in the Uruguayan half.3 min: Cavani is down clutching his handle after getting a whack from Hamed as they challenge for a loose ball near half-way. But the referee is not interested in his complaints. 2 min: It didn’t take long for Uruguay to regain possession and begin hogging the ball, as Egypt drop deep. That’ll be the pattern for most of the game, I fancy.1 min: Uruguay, wearing angelic white, kick off. Immedaitely they lose possession to Egypt, clad in red tops and black shorts and socks.How about a video telling the backstories of some of the top players at this tournament, including Suarez?Uruguay’s anthem is more a sedate tune but no one’s going to be fooled by that. The Egyptian national anthem benefits from enthusiastic accompaniment from their fans and players. They’re in the mood alright! Here come the starting XIs: both countries seems to have large and noisy followings in the crowd, with Egyptians dominating one whole end of a stadium that is not completely full. A smiling Salah gets a humungous cheer when he enters the arena to take his place on the bench. This is a terrific interview with Diego Godín by Sid Lowe, touching, for example, on that wonderful garra charrrúa mentality. Cavani and Suarez have 93 international goals between them. You’ve got to fancy them to reach the century during this tournament (isn’t that right, Saudi Arabia). But Egypt’s approach today will most likely be to concentrate on shutting them out. They’re unlikely to devote much time to attacking, at least until Salah comes on - though they are probably hoping to keep the score to 0-0 so they can save him for the next match. Before we enjoy today’s fare, here’s The Fiver’s take on the first match and Saudi Arabia’s ridiculous performance. Egypt and Uruguay might have met at the 1934 World Cup ... if Uruguay hadn’t refused to defend their title because only four European teams bothered to travel to South America fo the first tournament. Egypt took up the invitation in ‘34 and sailed over to Italy under a Scottish manager, James McCrae. They only lasted one match, beaten 4-2 by Hungary after having two goals controversially disallowed and conceding one following a challenge that left their goalkeeper with a broken nose. If only VAR had been around then, eh?And here are tactical guides to both teams, as produced by the ’s World Cup network: Uruguay here and Egypt here.You may think you’ve heard enough about Salah, but this piece by Salma Islam is well worth a gander. So as you can see from the teams below, Salah begins on the bench on his 26th birthday. Alongside him will be 45-year-old Essam El Hadary, as the Cuper has decided to give the gloves to Mohamed El Shenawy, the Al Ahly goalkeeper who’s a mere child of 29. Hello and welcome to the second match of the 2018 World Cup and the first to feature some of the planet’s best players. It’s being billed in some places as Luis Suarez v Mohamed Salah - and in at least two households as Diego Godin v Ahmed Hegazi - but essentially it’s a clash between two teams who will fancy their chances of getting out of Group A even more after watching Russia and Saudi Arabia yesterday.Uruguay, in particular, have realistic hopes of going much father than that. They finished second only to Brazil in the South American qualification league and are the highest-achieving football nation on Earth, twice world champions and 15-times winners of the Copa America - all from a population smaller than that of Los Angeles. And this side have a mean defence, inventive young midfielders and, of course, two of the most fearsome strikers around, in Suarez and Edinson Cavani. Mind you, there’s one hat-trick Suarez won’t be looking to complete today: in 2010 he perpetrated one of the most dastardlyheroic fouls in World Cup history when he deliberately handled the ball against Ghana and in 2014 he tried to eat an opponent. How do you follow up those deeds? By firing your country to World Cup glory, ideally.Speaking of firing your country to glory, behold Mo Salah! He’s back, albeit only on the bench! They’re aren’t many players who, after being Sergio Ramosed, would choose to make their return against Uruguay but Salah is no ordinary player. And with him Egypt have hope. They are not prolific scorers and stuttered during their buildup but, for the first appearance at the World Cup since 1990, the Pharaohs - under Hector Cuper - are likely to look to keep things tight and rely on their one true maestro to conjure moments of brilliance if he is introduced.

I apply a similar approach to my own cooking, and not just to Asian dishes.So, with that in mind, here are a few ideas to perk up those supermarket dips and condiments that we all instinctively grab for at the mere mention of the word “picnic”. Even just a squeeze of lemon and a little extra seasoning would be better than nothing – everything savoury benefits from the addition of those – but none of these tweaks involves much work or effort, and all will transform the mundane into the mouthwatering.Supermarket hummus is bland stuff compared with the real deal, so zhoosh it up by adding texture and flavour. Peel two carrots, cut into 3cm pieces, season well and roast in a little olive oil until soft and slightly coloured. Put in a blender with a clove of garlic, a tablespoon or two of harissa (I’d favour Belazu’s rose harissa, which is widely available in supermarkets), and two tablespoons each of lemon juice and tahini, and blitz to a rough paste. Stir into a standard 230g hummus pot, and you’re good to go. I’d also be inclined to serve it topped with crumbled feta, but that’s up to you.Give that shop-bought cucumber, yoghurt and mint dip a lift by stirring in burnt butter: for a 230g pot, melt 100g butter in a pan, cook until the milk solids separate, then strain to leave a gorgeous nutty sauce. Leave to cool, add a squeeze of fresh lemon, then stir into the tzatziki to give it a richer, more uplifting flavour. Serve with pakoras, cold salmon or as a dip for pitta, crisps, breadsticks and whatnot.Pep up supermarket guac with yuzu juice and yuzu kosho (look for the former in the world foods aisle of supermarkets find yuzu koshu in Asian food stores and online). The juice adds a sweetsour element, while the kosho, which is a bit like a citrus wasabi, has a fiery kick that brings the dip alive. Simply stir two teaspoons of each into a pot of guacamole, and you’re done. And if you can’t find yuzu kosho? Use wasabi paste instead.Own-brand taramasalata tends to be mild stuff, so benefits hugely from the addition of something vibrant and fresh. Blitz a handful of parsley leaves, 30g capers, 1 green chilli (deseeded if you don’t like much heat), three or four peeled garlic cloves, to taste (if you have time, you’ll get a mellower, more rounded garlic flavour if you first wrap it in foil with a dash of olive oil and roast it), a tablespoon of olive oil, and the zest and juice of half a lemon. Fold into a 230g pot of tarama, and the transformation is startling.I grew up in Australia, where sweet chilli and soured cream is A Thing. It’s a heavenly marriage, and there’s nothing at all complicated about it: mix equal quantities of sweet chilli sauce and soured cream to create a sweet, hot, spicy dip that goes brilliantly with cold grilled salmon or chicken, or as a dip for crudités.Sweet chilli sauce performs a similar trick on cream cheese. It has a much firmer texture than soured cream, of course, so this is better with on crackers and crisps.Supermarket coleslaw can be depressingly lifeless, but it doesn’t take much to turn it into something very moreish: for a 300g pot, simply stir in 60g sliced jalapeños in brine (drained), 100g tinned sweetcorn and 20g finely sliced cornichons.• Ramael Scully is chefpatron of Scully, London SW1, and co-author, with Yotam Ottolenghi, of Nopi: The Cookbook (Ebury Press)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f4d080009bc1a6545d5b33138111f9cbce3cba8/1035_832_6727_4036/master/6727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d3f8cdc59545bbfb96642786e2568ae","title":"thomasina miers recipe for poached cherry and chocolate tiramisu","story":"This inauthentic but delicious take on the Italian classic puts fruit centre stageI have a weakness for tiramisu. And much as I love the real deal, I’ve created this inauthentic one to celebrate the fleeting cherry season. Cherries aren’t cheap, but I still buy them the moment they appear in the shops, lest lack of demand eventually sees them off in favour of more easily harvested and therefore more affordable fruit (a lifelong paranoia). Of the original recipe, I have kept the booze-soaked biscuits and creamy mascarpone, to which I’ve added a wickedly rich, dark chocolate ganache and the softly poached fruit.The grassy notes of an unaged tequila go beautifully with dark chocolate and fruit. If you can’t find tequila, brandy will serve you well.170g caster sugar ½ vanilla pod, or ½ tsp vanilla extractJuice from 1 orange and zest from ½ 400g cherries, halved and stoned120ml tequila2 tbsp kirsch3 eggs, separated500g mascarpone20 savoiardi biscuitsFirst cook the cherries. Put 100g of the sugar, vanilla, orange zest and juice in a pan and cook over a gentle heat until the sugar has dissolved. Bring to a simmer, then add the cherries, tequila and kirsch. Cook for a couple of minutes until the cherries are just tender. Pour into a bowl and leave to cool.Meanwhile, beat the egg whites until stiff and set aside. Beat the yolks and the remaining sugar together until they are pale and have at least doubled in volume. This takes three to four minutes, so use an electric whisk to avoid a sore elbow. Now beat in the mascarpone, a third at a time, to avoid lumps. Fold the whites into the mascarpone mix.Now make the ganache: heat the cream in a saucepan until just simmering, turn off the heat and pour it over the chocolate, stirring to melt it. Add two tablespoons of the cherry juices into the melted chocolate.Lay the biscuits out in a shallow, wide dish that is large enough to give you a single layer of biscuits. Drain the remaining liquid from the cherries and drizzle it evenly over the biscuits. Pour over the ganache as evenly as possible don’t worry if it does not completely cover the biscuits. Now spread the mascarpone over the ganache. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and refrigerate for at least six hours, or overnight if easier, but it starts to deteriorate after 24 hours.Dust with a little cocoa powder and bring to the table in all its glory.The poached cherries are delicious with vanilla ice-cream or as an accompaniment to panna cotta you can make them more crowd-friendly by cutting down on the tequila. The ganache can be turned into a delicious chocolate sauce for ice-cream by heating with another 75ml whole milk, a knob of butter and a tablespoon of golden syrup. I always then add one to two tablespoons of unaged tequila – the flavour is just wonderful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6baa7007b583b6139c488e5686b2a298894a94/0_188_2753_1651/master/2753.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e29fe7465ddcb1229fa0d6bd52bacd4c","title":"penthouses for sale around the uk in pictures","story":"Hit heady heights with these top-floor properties, from Devon to Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4077fff7543e999fe9e9521561ca052f1aea675e/0_128_1099_659/master/1099.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26a4ca65766f35acf7676a46f167cf99","title":"alice glass on leaving crystal castles the cruelty never ceases to amaze me","story":"The singer found fame with the electro band before leaving and accusing her ex-bandmate of nonconsensual sex and controlling behaviour. Here, she talks about her decision to go publicAlice Glass’s Los Angeles home is a picture of gothic splendour. Her kitchen resembles a graveyard of dead flowers she is annoyed that her living black lilies never droop when she is looking. There is a fake Goya on the way down to her basement studio, where skulls surround the drums. A spider crawls out of the toilet roll when I use her bathroom. It is probably not part of the decor.Glass is less macabre: there is a tattoo of Bambi on her thigh. She loved the royal wedding. Her voice only rises above its perpetual whisper when she calls to her cats, Mr Peanut and Fuzzy, the alpha who dominates her pit bulls, Jacob and Shadow. She apologises for the boxes that entomb the sofa, merch from her recent debut solo tour. She had polled fans on Twitter to ask which song she should play from the back catalogue of her former band, the anarchic electro-punk duo Crystal Castles, which she quit in October 2014. Ultimately, she decided to play the material to which she still felt connected – “where I’m feeling worthless and hopeless”, she says. It took time in rehearsals to shake off their negative associations.It was not until allegations surfaced against Harvey Weinstein that Glass (born Margaret Osborn) was emboldened to go public with detailed allegations of abuse against her ex-bandmate, Ethan Kath (real name Claudio Palmieri). She felt it was her responsibility, “especially after I had been told he had done similar things to at least one other woman”. Glass had previously alluded to her experience when she released her debut solo single, Stillbirth, in July 2015: “You don’t own me any more,” she shrieked over music that she likened to “being eaten by fire ants”.The song allowed her to speak covertly at a time when she was scared of going outside in case she was served with a lawsuit, she says, claiming that Kath started making legal threats in response to her tweeting stats about domestic abuse fatalities shortly after she announced her departure from the band. Glass says she received cease-and-desist letters from the same firm that represented Bill Cosby, which quoted her tweets and intimated that Glass was making these statements to benefit her career. But seeing other women speaking out about abuse last October was like watching “someone jumping off a cliff”, she says. “If someone goes first, it lets you know that you’re safe. It really put things into perspective. If it wasn’t for them, I’m not sure how long it would have taken me to speak out.”She published a lengthy statement accusing Kath of nonconsensual sex, stalking, manipulation, intimidation and isolation, violence (including being dangled over a stairwell), control and derision. Kath has repeatedly denied Glass’s allegations, describing them as “pure fiction”. He sued her for defamation and issued his own statement: “Alice and I had a long ongoing relationship both personal and professional. When she suddenly left Crystal Castles to handle her mental health issues and substance abuse issues I fully supported her. I will continue to support her quest to wellness but I can’t support extortion, false claims, and accusations put forth after the band attained new success without her.” (She says his comments about mental health and substance abuse are “bullshit”.)Kath’s defamation lawsuit was dismissed in February, as was an appeal in May, in which he was ordered to pay Glass almost $21,000 (£15,800) in legal fees. The lawsuit was rejected under a California statute designed to protect freedom of speech the court did not make any finding on whether Glass’s allegations were true. He remains under investigation by the Toronto police sex crimes unit after complaints from several women, the police service confirmed to the . Glass does not know if he can bring the suit again. “Probably, he’ll try, but it’s not getting in my head,” she says. “I want him to know that he can keep trying to sue me and it’s not affecting me in the way that you think it is, you’re just spending more of your money and wasting more of your life.”In the early 00s, Glass was a teenage outcast in Toronto. She had difficulties with her parents, who agreed that she should move out aged 15 – she will not discuss why. She turned her flat into a squat for fellow punk runaways – “It was always an aspirational dream to live in a community of people that you can trust” – and formed bands. Fetus Fatale played only a couple of chaotic shows, but Kath has claimed he saw one of them and felt he had “discovered a great poet” in Glass. She doubts that she recalls them meeting when she bought his CD after a show. Her statement details what came next: she alleges that he intoxicated and had sex with her while he was sober. “I feel like, for a lot of it, he could have been anybody when I was lost and desperately searching for someone validating to my experiences,” she says.They recorded together, but she says he told her that the results were so poor that they would not be released. They lost touch Kath was in two other bands, “hedging his bets to see which would be the most successful”, says Glass. But then a song called Alice Practice started taking off on Myspace, so named because, according to Kath, Glass’s parts were merely a microphone test. Glass denies this, too, saying that she had written lyrics and melodies. She had no idea the music was online.A small record deal materialised and Glass says Kath encouraged her to quit high school to tour. She had never left Canada and was 18 when they arrived in Britain, where Crystal Castles experienced viral success, miming on the TV series Skins and leading a bratty noise scene. “Moshing with your friends is the best kind of medicine when you’re an aggravated young person,” Glass theorises of their popularity. She had no such community, was unable to connect to fans’ idolisation and felt like a misfit in the scene: “I don’t think that my expression was necessarily taken seriously, because I was a woman screaming in people’s faces.”The media portrayed her as a feral creature: Kath would extol her violent and accidental genius NME dedicated a spread to her knuckles after she punched a man at a festival. It is expected that violence and outlandish behaviour is concomitant with male musical genius. But when volatility is part of a woman’s artistic persona, her work is presented as an accident, rather than a purposeful statement. “It seems like a by-product of trauma or some expression that she’s not completely in control of,” Glass says. She wanted to explain herself – that she was violent at live shows because men groped her. But Kath told her it would be better to remain mysterious, disaffected. “That idea of nihilism leaves you completely open to let people come and take advantage of you.”She felt men came to shows to target her. “Like: ‘She doesn’t care what you do to her, pull her hair, try strangling her with your shirt, grab her around the groin, why don’t you rip her skirt off?’ They were all things that happened to me regularly. When a woman doesn’t really have agency – not doing interviews, having music that seemed unintentional, seeming like a vessel who’s there to fulfil someone else’s idea – then you can treat her not as a person and do whatever you want to her.”Glass began to see herself as abject. She had neither friends – she says Kath restricted her personal relationships – nor family ties. She felt “robotic”, escaping on stage then returning to the bus alone, scared to go out. She claims Kath told her that men liked to gang-rape feminists, dissuading her from sharing her ideals. She was so disconnected from reality that she believed him.Glass says the band’s manager, James Sandom, would lament Kath’s behaviour, but she feels he never offered her genuine support. “He pretended to care and pretended to help me at times – or sometimes would just say whatever it took to keep me working.” She says it took until 2012 for Sandom to acquiesce to her demands for a phone and a credit card. Kath allegedly held her passport and controlled the band’s finances, giving Glass “some money throughout the years, but not a proportionate account ... The ‘joint’ bank account,” she sneers.Last year, Sandom who still manages Crystal Castles – told the Daily  that he could offer “no further insight” into Glass’s accusations: “During our time managing Crystal Castles whilst their professional relationship was occasionally volatile, their personal relationship was never fully clear.” Glass disputed this, posting screenshots of emails in which she told Sandom that Kath had thrown her phone out of a moving car and ripped hair from her head. Sandom’s replies characterised Kath’s behaviour as “domestic abuse” and said he would call the police next time. I tried to speak to him prior to meeting Glass, but he declined, saying he had “nothing but admiration for Margaret” and wished her “the best on the path ahead professionally and personally”.“Fuck you,” she says at Sandom when I repeat this. The sun has dipped we have been talking in the dark. She bolts to look for a cigarette. Minutes later, her boyfriend, the musician Jupiter Keyes, comes upstairs with Glass, who has been crying. “Let me give you some light, OK,” he says, switching a lamp on before going out to buy wine.Glass sits back down and says: “It’s cliched to be somewhat triggered by that, but it’s a little weird that he would still be supporting him. I just don’t even know what to say to that. The amount of … cruelty? It never ceases to amaze me. But it’s not just me – there are people that will continue to suffer because they believe the person who’s telling them they wish them all the best really does. I would rather people like that said: ‘Y’know, she can go fuck herself, I don’t care that this happened to her.’”Glass does not know if Sandom talked to Kath about that incident and she does not think he called the police. She alleges a wider picture of neglect. Glass played on crutches for a year with a fractured ankle and performed through broken ribs and food poisoning. Her behaviour ties in with a pattern of self-abasement, but she says it was encouraged. When she proposed cancelling shows, she says Kath told her they would be sued, that fans would stop coming. It played to her sensibilities: “My entire life was performing, so I couldn’t imagine not being able to do that – it was my identity.”She says she repeatedly tried to quit, but she was told that doing so would be “such a shame, that kind of language”, she says. “It is hard to walk away from a project that you put everything into, especially if you almost believe that you’re being received as an artist by a fluke chance.” Glass says she had to get a lawyer to access her half of songwriting and publishing, and her new management had to lobby Twitter for the account that Kath had registered in her name. She was dating Keyes by the time Crystal Castles were supporting Depeche Mode in September 2013 as they drove away from the last date, she knew it was over.Glass goes to the balcony to smoke, gesturing at her “anxiety table of disgusting old cigarettes”. She is not surprised that Kath continued the band with another young, female singer who looks just like her. She says he would often threaten her with the prospect of a nameless girl waiting in the wings “who’s a better singer and who would put up with a lot worse than I would”. Part of Glass leaving entailed coming to terms with the fact that she probably would not be a musician any more. But after she freed herself she decided to write anyway, even if she did not think anyone would care. They did: she signed to Loma Vista (St Vincent, Iggy Pop), released Stillbirth and, last year, the Alice Glass EP.Her new single, Mine, was written with the songwriter Justin Tranter, who she chose for his work on Justin Bieber’s Sorry. None of Glass’s solo material has been an easy listen – eerie melodies snake around blasts of digital static – but Mine is a profoundly heavy listen, describing self-harm: “Abuse myself till I’m finally mine,” she sings. “That’s how desperate I felt,” she says now.She is more comfortable with people idolising her since she spoke out proud, even. But she still grapples with guilt: after her statement, more women alleged that Kath had abused them as teenagers. It was “surreal and fucked up” to know she was not alone, but equally so to contemplate that “a lot of these women – girls – met him because they were fans of mine. If I didn’t exist, then a lot of those experiences wouldn’t have happened.”Her eyes are glassy again. Easier said than done, but she can’t blame herself for that. “Some people have told me that, too, but in the brief times I got to express myself – this one-dimensional side that’s not a completely true representation – that is destructive. And the people that would feel connected to that are most likely damaged themselves and it’s a breeding ground for creeps. There’s no way not to feel guilty. I’m just gonna have to live with it for the rest of my life.”These days she attempts to think about Kath as little as possible, preferring to try to discern the logical explanations behind how she feels about herself. “Justice is just being able to live my life,” she says. Her left hand bears a fresh tattoo of white roses, to symbolise new beginnings. She repeatedly says that she is lucky to be here, to have a career. “That really is an ideal scenario for somebody like me – a damaged high-school dropout.” But she also knows that she put the work in to get here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a884d7d1405f614231af32d0b59dfc136030f3/43_203_3350_2010/master/3350.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aecfff07aed40c65de534d965f1379fd","title":"david byrne live review oxford new theatre talking heads","story":"Oxford New TheatreBarefoot and besuited, the Talking Heads frontman delivers an entrancing show of often extraordinary musicAt the end of last year, David Byrne posted a tweet claiming that his forthcoming world tour was “the most ambitious show I’ve done since the shows that were filmed for Stop Making Sense”. On one level, that’s just a smart way to drum up business. If you’re a left-field rock star 40-odd years into your recording career, it never harms to compare your latest work to a high watermark from your glorious past, and the 1984 Talking Heads movie is one of the few concert films in pop history that anyone other than a diehard fan might consider watching: a Jonathan Demme-directed riot of stylised dancing and constantly expanding suits that critic Pauline Kael called “close to perfection” and likened to the work of Jean-Luc Godard.But watching Byrne and his 11-piece backing band barefoot and besuited, you have to concede he also has a point. The show is incredibly ambitious. The musicians – who Byrne is keen to emphasise are playing everything live, without the aid of backing tracks – are in constant motion on a bare stage, no amplifiers or drum risers: the percussionists perform with their instruments around their necks, like a samba band, as does the keyboard player, which makes him look a little like a cinema ice-cream vendor. Their every movement is choreographed, sometimes in a familiar way – Byrne’s performance of Talking Heads’ 1980 hit Once in a Lifetime is clearly based on both its famous video and the opening of Demme’s film, where he flung himself around to the beat of Psycho Killer as if being shot – and sometimes in a manner that’s more puzzling. It isn’t entirely clear why, at one point, Byrne starts rolling up his left trouser leg mid song, but it certainly adds to the general air of otherness.It’s not an approach without risks. A rock show where even the way the backing singers stand between songs is choreographed runs the risk of feeling a little dry, and there are a couple of moments when the band, striding around the stage, all smiles, worryingly resemble participants in a jukebox musical based on Byrne’s oeuvre. But it’s more frequently disarming. The staging of Blind, a dense, writhing track from Talking Heads’ final album, Naked, is both incredibly simple and incredibly effective: the band stand in a line, illuminated by a single, powerful footlight, casting vast, looming shadows at the rear of the stage. The show works best when the precision of the staging chafes against visceral, urgent music, when the setlist delves into Talking Heads’ percussion-heavy, perspiration-soaked Afro-punk-funk zenith: you’re reminded what extraordinary songs Born Under Punches and The Great Curve are, how smartly they melded genres, too funky to feel cerebral.The material from Byrne’s most recent album, American Utopia, is a different matter entirely. Behind the South American percussion battery, the songs often sound like the work of his fellow New Yorkers, indie band the Magnetic Fields, albeit with their dolorous lyrical sarcasm replaced by something more whimsical: “The chicken thinks in mysterious ways.” If the staging can’t convince you that this stuff is the equal of what Byrne was writing in 1980, it can certainly potentiate it. The jarring musical shifts of I Dance Like This, a song quite annoying on record, are brilliantly played up: strobes flare, the dance routine continues unabated during one lengthy silence, the effect charming rather than infuriating.But for all the clever staging, it ends with something basic and powerful. Byrne and band cease the choreography and perform Janelle Monáe’s Hell You Talmbout, a chanted listing black Americans killed by police and vigilantes. It’s both potent and a riposte to anyone who thought American Utopia’s vision of the US might be a little too playful and arch for its own good, given the current climate, and it works: an austere finale to a strange and entrancing evening.• At Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, on 15 June.

Based in an exclusive loft at Hollywood’s legendary Rainbow Bar and Grill, it provided boozy sanctuary to many fellow stars including Ringo Starr, John Belushi, John Lennon, Keith Moon, Keith Emerson, Harry Nilsson and Marc Bolan. Their all-night drinking sessions took place away from the prying eyes of the media and nagging managers. The staff at the Rainbow dubbed the crew the Hollywood Vampires.“Because they only saw us at night and all we did was drink!” Cooper laughs down the line from New York. “I remember it, but the lines are a little blurred. Our lines would all get blurred quite a lot. It just seemed to be the place where everybody ended up.”These days Cooper is plainly doing a lot better than most of his friends, many now departed. A wiry and energetic 70-year-old, he is currently on tour – he’s almost always on tour, but this time it’s with the band he named after the drinking club, formed in 2015 with guitarists Joe Perry (of Aerosmith) and, more intriguingly, Johnny Depp.The roots of this all-star project stretch back to an intimate gig Cooper played at London’s 100 Club in 2011. Both Cooper and Depp were in the city to film Tim Burton’s horror comedy Dark Shadows. Cooper invited the actor to play a few songs and started toying with the idea of forming a covers band to pay tribute to his fallen drinking buddies. Depp and Perry (whom Cooper has known for decades) joined and the band made their live debut at LA’s Roxy Theatre in September 2015. They released their self-titled debut album the same month, featuring three originals among the classic rock covers. Well-received by rock bibles Kerrang! and Rolling Stone, the Vampires were credited with avoiding self-indulgence – though in the age of #MeToo, it remains to be seen whether they’ll pull off another tribute to macho rock-star excess.This month they are packing out Europe’s arenas and working on a second album of entirely original material. Quite how this works with three major stars sharing the spotlight is anyone’s guess, though it sounds as though their egos have found an odd equilibrium. “When we put three alpha males in the band, I did think, ‘Oh man, this could be tough,’” Cooper says. “But there’s never been an argument.”“You’ve got have ego to do what we do,” says Perry, “but with this I’m in a totally different headspace. I can just sit in the corner! It’s fucking great. And Johnny is the real deal, let me tell you.”Depp’s passion for music is well known. In the early 90s he was a member of the (largely unlistenable) alt-rock supergroup P, alongside Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Gibby Haynes of Butthole Surfers. In 1997 he played slide guitar on Oasis’s Be Here Now and he has performed with everyone from Marilyn Manson to Shane MacGowan.Allegations of domestic abuse towards ex-wife Amber Heard have affected his career, which was already struggling in the wake of flops like The Lone Ranger and Transcendence. (After Heard accused him of physical and verbal abuse “during the entirety” of their relationship, the couple orced. Heard received a $7m settlement, which she donated to charity, and the couple released a joint statement describing their relationship as “volatile, but always bound by love”.)Meanwhile, recent photos of Depp looking gaunt have prompted speculation that he is unwell. Having been told firmly that questions along these lines will bring the interview to a halt, I ask instead what he gets from rock’n’roll. “My day job is a completely different animal, I suppose,” he says. “What do I get from this that I normally don’t get? I get me!” He laughs. “But when I’m up there on stage with these guys, it’s that feeling I had as a kid. It’s freedom. In movies someone is always telling you what to do, but here I have the freedom that my day job doesn’t allow. Most important, it’s really fucking fun.”Perry is particularly eager to sing Depp’s praises, noting that he first realised that Depp had a talent when he saw him playing acoustic guitar in Lasse Hallström’s 2001 film Chocolat. “Quite often when you watch a movie and someone is playing, you can really tell that it’s not for real,” Perry states. “But he was playing some really cool shit, things I’d never touched on as a guitarist. A lot of actors and actresses have walked our way over the years” – pun presumably intended – “but with Johnny it’s different. There’s a laser focus in his eyes.”“He trades licks with Joe and I’d put him up against any second guitarist out there,” agrees Cooper, with somewhat faint praise. “He needs to prove himself every night and that’s a good thing. It gives him that edge.”Hollywood Vampires’ summer tour ends on 8 July in Rome, after which Cooper and Depp will continue working on their second album. Time will tell as to whether their novelty value will survive, but both are adamant that they’re now taking what was once a bit of fun a lot more seriously.“I think we really found our sound this time I think we just had it by the tail on the first record,” says Depp. Cooper adds: “We’re doing what we keep telling young bands to do: don’t lose the anger in rock’n’roll, don’t lose that edge, don’t mellow out! All of the songs that have been written so far are really raucous rock’n’roll songs. It’s got a lot of attitude to it.”Given how many of the original Hollywood Vampires drinking club members are gone, Cooper ranks as one of the great survivors of rock’s first golden era. Perry too, a former addict, has every reason to be thankful. But only last month, reports emerged of a drunk Depp threatening to attack a crew member on a film set. Could this totem to excess, in some perverse way, be a form of rehabilitation?“What separates survivors from the guys that die?” Depp wonders aloud. “It’s just about having the right people around you, people who care about you, at the right time, to save you from yourself. It’s not a good thing to face on your own,” he says, of alcoholism and addiction, “but some people do. Really, it’s just luck.”“That is definitely true,” Cooper agrees. “There were times when I should’ve been gone. I’m 70 now and I’m in better shape than I was at 28. At 28 I was a wreck. I’d never heard the word tofu in my life. I was trying to live that lifestyle as fast as I could and it was non-stop.” Still, he can’t help romanticising the myth of the male rock star. “You just wrote your songs, ate what you could, drank as much as you can and went off to be a great rock band after…. And we looked good doing it!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03d79b3fc3b729b0a81936e0e91ba209b98ed542/0_79_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff2229522b1bf4ee0bd97bab6b249d73","title":"johnny marr call the comet review the light that never went out","story":"There’s always an elephant in the room with Johnny Marr, a lumbering old elephant Marr last worked with 31 years ago. Ahead of the release of Marr’s third solo album, said elephant had been trumpeting on about Anne Marie Waters and Tommy Robinson, but this may, oddly, be to Marr’s benefit. The dismay Morrissey has caused appears to have led some people to take the view of Marr – whose every public utterance displays a man of empathy and grace – as “the good one” in the Smiths, and concentrated attention on his music in its own right, music that is now substantially more interesting than Morrissey’s. Call the Comet is an album to take advantage of that goodwill. It’s the best of Marr’s solo albums, and while he may not have the lyrical dexterity or vocal charisma of some of his former collaborators, age shows no sign of withering his facility with melody, or that gorgeous, liquid guitar playing. Call the Comet ends with a song that embodies both Marr’s humaneness and his musicality: A Different Gun was written about the Nice attack of 2016 and was being recorded the night of the Manchester Arena bombing last year. But it’s not angry it does not seethe or condemn. Instead, it demands empathy with the victims and a commitment that life be lived (the “stay and come out tonight” refrain comes from Broken Social Scene’s Kevin Drew persuading Marr to appear with the band in Manchester the night after the bombing). It’s set to a skyscraping, luscious melody, a kind of Marr redux, that yearns and soars like the emotions the lyric tries to evoke. Elsewhere, there music is less conciliatory: New Dominions, Actor Attractor and My Eternal have a chilly, mechanised post-punk feel on Rise and Hey Angel, Marr’s guitar is purposely unbeautiful, seething and squalling. Those who want jangles and arpeggios need not fear: they’re present and correct on Day In Day Out and Hi Hello, songs that sound as though they have existed in Marr’s head since 1985. Call the Comet is a terrific album in its own right. In context, it’s a triumph.

One of the most successful pop stars of the decade with nine US chart-toppers and 13 UK Top 10 singles to date, she’s used to letting her gold-plated hits act like placeholders while an identity is constructed behind them. However, last year’s muddled, banger-free Witness album brought the facade crashing down, leaving Perry mumbling about “purposeful pop” and undertaking a bizarre four-day Big Brother-style live stream in which she underwent therapy, did yoga with Mitchell from TV’s Modern Family and cooked meatballs with Gordon Ramsay. What had appeared effortless during her imperial phase (circa 2010’s Teenage Dream) suddenly carried a whiff of pop’s kryptonite: desperation.The Witness album’s one positive, however, is that its cultural impact was so minimal – the few album tracks she plays tonight pass by with barely a hint of recognition – that the live show isn’t hampered by an album-related story arc. Instead, Perry, in full-on escapist mode, upends a metaphorical toy box and scatters its neon-hued contents around the arena, turning each corner into a cross-section of the Las Vegas strip. It’s a full-on sensory overload that baffles as much as it entertains. For reasons no one can quite fathom, for example, two dancers join her for Hot N Cold dressed as giant flamingos. During Bon Appétit she reclines on a giant salad leaf and is doused in salt and pepper before being consumed by a Jeff Koons-esque venus fly trap. I Kissed a Girl, meanwhile, sees her ascend into the parted, cherry chapsticked lips of a hovering mouth before they clamp shut.Often Perry is absorbed into the madness rather than controlling it. As a result the show walks the line between pop and pantomime, veering too close to the latter during an extended “comedy” routine with Left Shark, the inept dancer turned meme who stole Perry’s Super Bowl half-time performance back in 2015. Swish Swish, the lukewarm diss track released before Perry sent a literal olive branch to former nemesis Taylor Swift, meanwhile, descends into an episode of It’s a Knockout, with Perry and a “drunk hot dad” from the audience playing basketball against each other (she loses). Both tangents deflate the show’s momentum – especially the former, which follows an incredible run of undeniable bangers that segues from Dark Horse into Teenage Dream into California Gurls. It’s a breathless reminder of a pop star at full pelt.It’s there in flashes during the effervescent disco-pop of Chained to the Rhythm, which finds Perry joined, as she was at last year’s Brit awards, by two giant effigies in suits. This time, however, they’re not made to resemble May and Trump, but generic businessmen, making the song’s political allusions even more vague. By the time she shouts “wake up” at us hapless sheep in the audience your face can’t help but contort into the eye-roll emoji you half expect to see pop up as a prop at any moment.Perry’s on safer ground during the show’s few slower moments, gliding over the crowd on top of a multicoloured planet for the lovely Wide Awake. Unfortunately this is followed by an extended speech, delivered in a mockney accent, about her love of English breakfasts that includes the line “Heinz means beans”. Not pop’s best singer or dancer, and with her confidence knocked, it’s as if Perry has decided her real talent lies in children’s TV presenting. In the end it’s left to Firework – her iron-clad empowerment anthem – to send everyone home feeling uplifted. It does the trick, but only just. Perry may be working as hard as ever but the rewards are diminishing. • At O2 Arena, London, on 15 June. Box office: 0844 856 0202.

But with Labour Live – the party’s attempt at running a music and politics festival, one year on from the Glastonbury love-in – organisers will just be hoping a few thousand people turn up and the rain holds off.Insiders say more than 3,000 of 20,000 tickets have been sold, though the party won’t confirm this. The trade union Unite has been giving away tickets just to ensure a decent crowd at the White Hart Lane recreation ground in Tottenham, north London, on Saturday.In a week in which Theresa May has faced incessant battles to force Brexit though the parliament, Labour staffers talk of little other than the prospects for Labour Live, with its success or otherwise being seen within the party as an indicator of whether Corbyn’s popularity has peaked. One senior party employee said that while the idea – the brainchild of the MP Ian Lavery – was well intentioned, the leader’s team was too optimistic, declining to take on expert help and, particularly, refusing to allocate enough funding. “There was just this belief that artists would perform for free like they do in election campaigns for the good of the Labour party, but this has none of the intensity of a campaign,” one said. Key figures in the party, led by Corbyn’s all-powerful chief of staff, Karie Murphy, have a fight on their hands to ensure the event is seen as a success. They secured a badly needed coup on Thursday when Clean Bandit were announced as headliners and ticket sales have picked up somewhat since. Up to then the best-knownact had been the indie group The Magic Numbers. Well known Corbyn supporters, the band were among those who appeared in support of the Labour leader at a rally in Birmingham where thousands gathered last June before the general election.The difficulty in attracting high-profile acts had hampered ticket sales for months and sources say at one point in the spring Labour seriously considered cancelling the event. They decided not to after it was said at a crucial meeting that grime artist Stormzy had been booked. That turned not to be the case, and while hasty attempts were made to secure his presence it did not prove possible. Reports that he had demanded a £100,000 fee have been denied by the party. It even proved difficult for Labour to book party stalwart Billy Bragg due to his tour commitments Bragg already had a gig booked in Kent on Saturday night. Labour Live’s first acts are due on the main stage shortly after noon. There will be turns from local MPs David Lammy and Kate Osamor, the party’s general secretary Jennie Formby, and Corbyn himself, who is due on at 5.30pm after an introduction from the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Corbyn will be followed by The Magic Numbers, while “original Sex Pistol” Glen Matlock and Reverend and The Makers due on later.Ticket prices were slashed from £35 to £10, while Corbyn got more involved in an attempt to recreate the 2017 election spirit. He told the Fire Brigades Union annual conference in Brighton last week: “We have new types of political events such as the Labour Live festival. It will have musicians, speakers, activists, trade unionists all coming together in one place … to learn from each other … but also to enjoy ourselves while reflecting on how far Labour has come as a movement.” Although not everybody in the audience was convinced. A constant stream of leaks from inside Labour have not helped. Party sources said the festival’s drinks supplier – the Workers Beer Company – was refusing to supply beer kegs as it didn’t think there would be enough people to justify them. Organisers were said to have “gone to war” with the company, though it remains to be seen whether revellers will be served draft beer or bottles and cans.Event costs could be as high as £1.4m, though the exact figure is a closely guarded secret and will not be known until the event is over. Insiders at Unite and Labour have said the trade union is underwriting most of the costs, though neither the party nor the union will comment.Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, is due to appear at the festival’s “solidarity tent” for People’s Question Time, while his union is also sponsoring a hip-hop karaoke event, challenging attendees to “prove you are better at karaoke than they are!”, and an ice cream van, which will carry the slogan “Ice cream lovers of the world – unite” and play a jingle version of The Red Flag. A Labour spokesperson said that the party “couldn’t say right now” whether it would repeat Labour Live in the future. “We thought it worth trying as Glastonbury isn’t on this year. We’ll see how it goes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70f5984b7d04194f0888dbbd9f14ff8854bb7f1c/0_133_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6477169b7c0307190efc27faeaa5c545","title":"720m large hadron collider upgrade could upend particle physics","story":"Collider will be far more sensitive to anomalies that could lead to entirely new theories of the universeA massive project to supercharge the world’s largest particle collider launched on Friday in the hope that the beefed-up machine will reveal fresh insights into the nature of the universe.The 950m Swiss franc (£720m) mission will see heavy equipment, new buildings, access shafts and service tunnels installed, constructed and excavated at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, the particle physics laboratory on the edge of Geneva.The vast machine, which occupies a 27km circular tunnel under the French-Swiss border, hunts for signs of new physics by slamming subatomic particles together at close to the speed of light. In compliance with Einstein’s law Emc2, some of the energy of impact is converted into new matter.The upgrade will make the collider far more sensitive to subtle quirks in the laws of physics, and physicists hope these anomalies will prise open the door to entirely new theories of the universe.In 2012 physicists on the LHC announced the discovery of the Higgs boson, which had leapt into the most fleeting existence inside the machine’s detectors when bunches of hydrogen nuclei, or protons, were crashed into one another billions of times over. The discovery earned a Nobel prize for Peter Higgs and the Belgian physicist François Englert for their theoretical work on the particle in the 1960s.If the upgrade goes to plan, the proton beams in the souped-up accelerator, known as the high-luminosity LHC, or HL-LHC, will be so intense that the number of collisions in the machine will be five to 10 times greater than today.“The high-luminosity LHC is where we will collect most of our data, and in that sense it is the phase of our exploration that lets us find out most about the universe,” said Tara Shears, a professor of physics at Liverpool University who works on the collider’s LHCb detector. “If the LHC so far has given us a candle to illuminate what was previously unseen, the high-luminosity LHC will let us shine a searchlight.”Physicists are already exploring some strange signals at the LHC that could be the first hints that the so-called standard model of particle physics is about to break down. The standard model is a series of equations that describe how particles such as the electrons and quarks found inside atoms interact with each other. The theory works brilliantly, but physicists know it is incomplete: it says nothing about gravity, or the dark matter that clings unseen to galaxies, or the dark energy that drives the expansion of the universe, or why the world around us is made of matter instead antimatter.The curious signals seen that the LHC in recent months are too tenuous to convince most physicists that they are real, but if they strengthen over time, as happened with the Higgs boson, they could reveal the existence of completely unexpected new particles, dubbed leptoquarks or Z primes.To ramp up the number of collisions at the LHC, engineers will fit powerful magnets to squeeze the protons into finer, more dense beams. They then plan to fit devices called crab cavities that use an electromagnetic pulse to give bunches of protons a little sideways kick as they enter the LHC’s detectors. This makes the protons rotate a smidgen the moment before they strike protons coming the other way, which drives up the number of collisions. They are called crab cavities because they make the proton bunches move sideways, even if the rotation is minuscule.“It’s a very exciting time,” said Rob Appleby, a particle physicist at Manchester University and UK spokesperson for HL-LHC. “It opens the door to the most precise and sensitive era of fundamental physics we’ve ever had.”The upgrade is expected to take eight years. While new magnets and beam instruments will be installed when the LHC is switched off for two years in 2019, most of the required equipment will be fitted in a longer shutdown from 2024 to 2026, when the revamped machine will switch back on again.“If the anomalies we see in the LHC at the moment manifest in the next couple of years, which they may well do, what we’ll be looking at with the high luminosity-LHC is the physics underlying those discoveries,” said Val Gibson, a professor of physics at Cambridge University who also works on the collider’s LHCb detector. “That would turn the standard model on its head. It would be totally groundbreaking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3411da384ce15bcd62e922409e839f00b4b6f479/95_65_2503_1502/master/2503.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cb2ad1314c2ea12ab0a4b101361e9ea","title":"england v south africa third womens odi live","story":"8th over: South Africa 17-1 (Wolvaardt 12, Steyn 2) Shrubsole starts her fourth, running away from us at pavilion end. No respite for Steyn. This looks a great toss to have lost for England, the ball hooping around a treat. Fantastic over, another maiden. Shrubsole is putting on a clinic of new-ball bowling here (even if her first wicket miiiiiight not have been hitting the stumps). England’s opening bowlers have conceded runs from just nine balls in eight overs so far. 7th over: South Africa 17-1 (Wolvaardt 12, Steyn 2) Leg bye to short fine, a run taken to give the strike back to Wolvaardt. She looks more composed against Brunt, defending with the full face of the bat with a nice high elbow. Just the extra from the over, though. This power play running out quickly for the tourists. 6th over: South Africa 16-1 (Wolvaardt 12, Steyn 2) Wolvaardt takes a couple through the gap just forward of square. There’s half an appeal for leg before next but it is going down the legside. Charlotte Edwards on TMS wants to see them trying to score down the ground rather than square as Shrubsole again sneaks through and hits a pad. No appeal this time she’s getting a lot of movement here. Three excellent overs completed from her end, Anya’s figures so far of 3-1-3-1. 5th over: South Africa 14-1 (Wolvaardt 10, Steyn 2) Steyn gives the strike to Wolvaardt with a single off her hip to begin the new Brunt over. The opener picks up her second boundary here but it isn’t as convincing as her first, edging down to the third man rope. The right-hander takes another single in that direction to retain the strike but in control along the carpet this time around. 4th over: South Africa 8-1 (Wolvaardt 5, Steyn 1) Steyn off the mark first ball, Wolvaardt in her defensive posture for the remainder of the successful Shrubsole set. Yep, that’s out and it is the big wicket! For the first time today, Lee tried to find the legside boundary. She missed and was hit dead in front. No hesiation from the umpire. Perfect start from Shrubsole, who has a wicket to her name before conceding a run. Lee was dominant in Worcester and Hove so that will be some relief to the hosts. 3rd over: South Africa 7-0 (Lee 2, Wolvaardt 5) Shooooot. Wolvaardt plays through point off the balls of her feet, a beautifully timed boundary. We have been waiting to see her pile up a stack of runs through the off-side this series. Maybe today. Brunt keeps her defending for the rest of the set. Solid start from all involved.2nd over: South Africa 3-0 (Lee 2, Wolvaardt 1) Maiden from Shrubsole to Lee to get her day started. Back to regular programming from me in an over or two. 1st over: South Africa 3-0 (Lee 2, Wolvaardt 1) Three singles off Brunt to get us going. The solution to the wifi issue is that I am off the CEO’s office. La-di-da! Charlotte Edwards on TMS reports that both of the changes to the South African XI are a result of injury. “It looks like Steyn is going to bat at three.” There you go. The visitors, a deeply religious team, have taken a knee in front of the boundary for their pre-match prayer. Please be patient with me over the first few overs. The wifi at the ground is cooked and they are working on a fix. But we’ll muddle through!So they don’t go for the third seamer, Kate Cross, who was brought into the squad.Offspinner Ntozakhe and newcomer Lackay are out in favour of right-hand bat Steyn and experienced right-arm seamer Klaas.England unchanged from the side that won comfortably at Hove on Tuesday. Two changes for South Africa, Klass and Steyn in for Lackay and Ntozakhe.Nat Sciver receives her “50” cap. Nice moment. A bit muggy overhead, I neglected to mention before. At least it felt that way when I was hoofing it from the train station. Maybe a hint of green on the track as well, or so it seems from 100-odd metres away. Welcome to the third and series-deciding ODI between England and South Africa at Canterbury! What a great ground for it. It’s the first time that a women’s ODI has been played here since 2008 but the hosts did lose their last international at the ground, an Ashes Test Match against the Australians in August 2015. It’s a different England team to the one that turned out in that game three years ago. Not in terms of personnel - the bulk of the players are the same - but in mindset. No two players better reflect than than Nat Sciver and Tammy Beaumont. The former is playing her 5oth limted-overs international today, which prompted me to dig up some stats. Until two years ago, Nat Sciver had batted 15 times in her three years in (and out of) the ODI side, never striking a six, believe it or not. In the two years since, she has whacked 15 of them with the best strike rate (105) in the history of women’s ODIs. She has struggled to repeat her heroics of the 2017 World Cup since, and is yet to get out of the blocks so far in this series, but I’ll back her in on a milestone occasion. As for Beaumont, she averaged 17 with the bat at a strike rate of 42 before Mark Robinson took over as coach in 2016. Since, she has averaged 49 with a strike rate of 79, collecting the World Cup player of the tournament gong along the way. On Tuesday, she was integral to England turning it around with the bat after their dreadful collapse on Saturday, scoring her fourth ODI ton. Call it the Robbo Effect (or something like that). As for the visitors, they have the chance to knock England off in an ODI series in this series for the first time. After bowling the house down on Saturday they were smashed all over the park on Tuesday. Looking out the press box window, the track has that straw-coloured look that suggests it will be a road, so they will be relying on Lizelle Lee to continue as she left off with 92 not out and 118 in her two hits in the series to date. Righto. The OBO is always a lot better when we talk, so don’t be shy. Drop a line to my (new address!) inbox or tweet at me with aggression. Back for the toss at 1:30pm.

Fuck!” At which point Woods tries to bury the hosel of his wedge into the turf. Bam! Bat! He’s really not happy with that third shot, viewing families of America. Thing is, the ball bites pin high, 20 feet from the cup. High standards, this dude, but then he has won 14 majors. Two putts, and that’s a bogey, all the fault of the wild drive. Johnson and Thomas get up and down for their pars. Meanwhile Dufner continues to go the wrong way: another problem from over the back of the green, this time at 13, leading to back-to-back bogeys. Just a little bit of separation at the top of the leader board now.Trouble for everyone down the long par-four 14th. Tiger’s in the deep stuff down the right, and can only hack back out onto the fairway. Dustin’s in the first cut on the other side, and was expecting his ball to come out hot, but he didn’t get a flyer and his second stops well short of the green. Thomas was in the middle of the fairway, but dumped his approach into the bunker front right. He’s still in the best nick of the three, though.Jason Dufner drops back to level par for the championship. His tee shot at 12 found the rough to the right, his second flew through the green, and you know how that usually pans out on this course by now. Young Sam Burns has completed the back nine in 36 strokes, improving on his slow start with birdie at 17: he’s back to +2. And Tommy Fleetwood is in credit today: birdie at 10, bogey at 11, and another birdie at 13 sees him nudge up the leader board to +4. Brought up on the links of Royal Birkdale, you’d think this set-up would favour a player with the European number one’s experience he’s nicely placed, six off the lead.Big Dustin is one cool customer. Having hit a terrible wedge in, leaving himself quite the poser, he clips a crisp wedge over the sand to three feet. That’s such a lovely shot in the circumstances. He simply refused to let the initial mistake fluster him. He salvages his par. Meanwhile a two-putt par for Tiger that’s two putts shaved off yesterday’s total on this hole. And finally a brilliant birdie for Thomas, who didn’t play a particularly good bunker shot, but curled in a confident right-to-left breaker from ten feet. He moves back to +4.A big mistake by DJ, whose wedge into 13 only just reaches the green, and topples back off, rolling behind the bunker Thomas is in. That’s an awful miss, and the co-leader’s going to have some work getting up and down for his par. Tiger leaves himself a 15-foot uphill putt for birdie that one wild drive aside, he’s looked very solid today. To be fair, he looked very solid yesterday, if you factor out three rushes of blood that led to two double bogeys and a triple. But that’s golf for you.Some downtime on the 13th tee as the players wait for the green to be cleared. It’s a short par four, and Justin Thomas is going for it. He sends his drive into the bunker guarding the front right of the green that’s the place to miss. Tiger and Dustin decide to take irons instead. Beforehand, up on the dancefloor, Pat Perez stroked in a 30-footer for a birdie that takes him to +2.Tiger wedges delicately to a couple of feet. That’s a wonderful par save. Then Thomas bumps his third up to three feet he’ll escape with a par after a wild tee shot, too. Finally Dustin, who has a fairly straight 30-foot birdie putt. He tugs it a bit, but it’s perfectly judged for speed, so that’s three pars out of three on 12 for this group. Tiger is +7, Thomas +5, Johnson -2.Dustin finds his third green in regulation out of three. The benefit of being on the fairway. By comparison, Thomas flies his second through the back, facing an up and down from thick greenside rough, while Tiger can only hack his way out of the thick fescue and into the first cut on the other side of the fairway. He’s still got 70 yards to the green. Birdie meanwhile for Jason Dufner at 10 he immediately joins Scott Piercy and Ian Poulter, both out later this afternoon, at -1.Oh Sergio. The 2017 Masters champion (it’s nice to type that) wasn’t in the worst position after his opening round of 75, but he’s playing himself out of contention this morning. A bogey at 11 followed a double at 12, his putter letting him down badly. He crashes to +8. Meanwhile a bogey for Henrik Stenson at 2, and the handily placed Swede slips to +2.All change at the top! Russell Henley can’t get up and down from the side of 14, and drops back to -2. Meanwhile joining him in the lead is Big Dustin, who clipped his tee shot at 11 to five feet and then knocked in the birdie putt. He looks calm and controlled this week, coming off the back of victory at last week’s St Jude Classic, a win that returned him to world number one. He’s the only man in his group to crash his drive down the middle of 12, as well: Thomas wangs his right, while Tiger is in fescue on the other side.Oh Justin. Disoriented after playing 10 so badly, Thomas pulls his tee shot at the par-three 11th down the swale to the left of the green. Jordan Spieth took a couple of attempts to chip up the bank from there yesterday, so Thomas elects to play a Scottish-style bump along the ground. The ball still slips 20 feet past the hole ... but oh Justin! He rattles in the putt coming back, and that’s a sensational up and down from a very difficult position. He stays at +5. I have no idea why more players aren’t employing links tactics when they get in trouble round here, the old-school course being what it is, but players insist on getting the lob wedges out regardless, like it’s a regular week on Tour or something. Anyway, Thomas appears to have learned his lesson. That was brilliant course management. He was staring double bogey in the face there.A birdie earlier for Rafa Cabrera Bello, at 10 he moves to +2. An eventful start for Alex Noren, who doubled 10 but birdied the par-three 11th he’s +3. Brian Gay made 73 yesterday, briefly sharing the lead, but bogeys at 10, 12 and 15 see the veteran journeyman drop to +6. The 21-year-old Sam Burns, a hot prospect from Louisiana, shot a fine 71 yesterday but he’s bogeyed 12 and 15 today he’s +3. And the equally promising Xander Schauffele is heading the wrong way, too: he’s dropped shots at 2 and 3, and slips to +4.Thomas is made to pay for that mistake off the tee. His chip up from the back is the best part of 40 feet short, and his par putt isn’t all that either. He’s got a seven-footer for bogey. He does very well to roll it in, and limit the damage. He’s +5. Par for Dustin, who remains at -1. Tiger nearly misses his short birdie putt, the ball skirting all the way round the lip before dropping, but it’s in, and he’s +7. He looks happy and relaxed today here’s to his being one of many to embark on a charge up the leader board.That’s a chance for the overnight co-leader Dustin Johnson to close the gap at the top. Because Russell Henley was out very early, and he’s gone off like a train, arrowing approaches to the pin and 10 and 12 to tear off on his own. Here’s how that’s changed the toppermost of the leader board.Good morning, Southampton! Will today play even tougher than yesterday? With the wind switching around all day, it’s possible. Then again, the hole placements are a little bit more accessible. So it’s swings and roundabouts. Either way, accuracy from the tee is still essential ... as immediately proved by Justin Thomas. The reigning PGA champion let his opening tee shot, an iron from 10, drift off to the left. From the semi-rough, he’s taken a flyer straight through the green and down the back. That’ll be a test coming back up. By comparison, his playing partners Dustin Johnson and Tiger Woods found the fairway, and have set up birdie chances with their approaches. Tiger’s is particularly special, to three or four feet.Welcome to the second round of the 2018 US Open at Shinnecock Hills, where the world’s greatest players are being put through quite the test. The three-time champion Tiger Woods shot 78 yesterday, as did 2015 winner Jordan Spieth the 2011 champ Rory McIlroy couldn’t break 80 the 2014 champ Martin Kaymer, who carded 65 on his opening round at Pinehurst, signed for an 83.But, y’know, winning a US Open shouldn’t be easy. And you shouldn’t necessarily be under par. Only four players posted a red number yesterday the USGA will argue that this is exactly how it should be. That 7th hole still looks like a poser too far, mind. But hey ho. Here’s the very top of the leader board, and remember, for every Tiger, Jordan and Rory, there’s a Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and Louis Oosthuizen placed very handily.The tee times, starting at hole 1 ...... and starting at hole 10..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bca4094c3b58067c83cb92c48c40c67e38e6f810/0_19_4839_2903/master/4839.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c319fca816bc4735f036c4d662c2d8d","title":"brazil panini world cup sticker swaps","story":"Organized meetings known as pontos de troca have helped cash-strapped collectors band together and get round price increaseOn a sunny afternoon outside Sao Paulo’s modern art museum, more than 100 people have gathered to trade football stickers, using paper charts or mobile phone apps to keep record of their collections.Brazil is still reeling from an institutional and political crisis and only just crawling out of a brutal recession, but for one month the World Cup offers some escape from the country’s record unemployment and spiraling violence.And this year, organized swap meetings – known in Portuguese as pontos de troca – “swap points” have sprung up across the country, helping cash-strapped collectors band together, and get around a dramatic surge in sticker prices.Renato Vasconcelos had collected World Cup football stickers since he was a child, but thought he wouldn’t bother this year when Panini announced in March that it was doubling the price of the five-sticker packets.“I never managed to complete an album before and with the increase in prices, I thought it would be impossible,” said the 33-year-old systems analyst.Yet as the tournament begins, Renato is the proud owner of a completed album – and his partner Mariana is just three stickers short.The couple attribute much of their success to the proliferation of pontos de troca.Facilitated by social media, meetups have been held in parks, stadiums, barbershops and even churches from the industrial powerhouses of the south-east to the jungle cities of the Amazon.With the price increase to two reais (about 50 cents or 40p) for a packet of five stickers, the minimum cost to complete this year’s 682-sticker Panini album is 274 reais ($72 or £55).But that would be without any repeated stickers, which is virtually impossible. Economists estimate that to complete an album alone would average about 2,000 reais ($525£395). In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s richest state, the average monthly income was 1,712 reais in 2017, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.Gabriel Tasca, 27, completed his first album by acquiring one of the rarer shiny metallic stickers of the Uruguay aquad from Renato’s partner Mariana at the modern art museum swap point, receiving claps and cheers.“I managed to save a lot of money,” he said, estimating that he had spent 300 reais on stickers, before offering his remaining spares to whoever wanted them.Sticker swap meets organized via social media networks first gained national attention before the 2014 World Cup, which Brazil hosted, but since then have grown in popularity.“With the crisis and price increases, more people are opting for swap points this year,” said Diego Moreira, who runs the site Passion to Collect, which lists swap point times and locations with a Facebook group that has nearly 50,000 members across Brazil.But while collectors say “swap points” have helped out their wallets, many have other complaints. “The problem this year is the bloody shiny ones,” said Francisco Silva, 53, a confectionery shop worker, now on his second album this year, and who has collected every year since 1990.Francisco and other collectors allege that the metallic shiny stickers are in unusually short supply this year and accused Panini of producing fewer to increase profits. Panini denies the allegation.But amid the apparent scarcity, a lucrative black market flourishes. Hardcore collectors disapprove of paying for rarities – instead of swapping them, but at the Sao Paulo modern art museum swap point, some were willing to break the taboo.Collectors at the swap point looked on disapprovingly, muttering darkly about a boy who had recently bought the last sticker he needed for 50 reais.“It’s exploitation,” said Vasconcelos. “I think it shows a lack of character.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31be6df46131a86cad0b2f8d762388f735bb283a/0_359_2986_1792/master/2986.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f10fa1e8d01448dd557871568f04e17c","title":"chinese defend einsteins diaries filthy obtuse","story":"Scientist’s travel diaries from 1920s revealed racist attitudes including describing people who were ‘spiritless’Chinese internet users have defended Albert Einstein’s recently published travel diaries in which the physicist calls the Chinese “industrious, filthy people.” Portions of the diaries from his travels in Asia in the 1920s were posted online this week and their content surprised Einstein fans.“Chinese don’t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods,” he wrote. “All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.” The theoretical physicist, who once said racism was “a disease of white people”, added: “It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.”While some internet users called for a “boycott of Einstein” and said his observations proved “all humans, even Einstein, have a stupid, shallow side,” most said the China Einstein witnessed is nothing like it is today. “Einstein went to China at the wrong time,” said one Weibo user, describing the early years of the Chinese republic, established in 1912, which came after centuries of imperial rule. “Hunger, war, and poverty all pressed on the Chinese. How could Chinese people at the time gain Einstein’s respect?” Many were in strong support of the scientist: “This is called insulting China? That’s ridiculous. Did the Chinese in that era look dirty? When I see the photos from then, they look dirty, Einstein depicted the true state of that era.”Others compared the scientists’s observations to that of Lu Xun, considered the father of modern Chinese literature, who was best known for his scathing satire of Chinese society in the early 20th century. “We praise Lu Xun because he pointed out our disadvantages. Why should we blame Einstein for this?”Historical narratives promoted by the Chinese government often paint the days before China’s communist party took power in 1949 as chaotic. The state-run Global Times published an editorial on Friday praising the level-headed response of Chinese internet users. The author, who goes by the pen name Gengzhige, wrote: “I’m curious what Einstein would write now if he saw the open attitudes most Chinese show today toward his private diary.” The editorial elicited over 2,000 comments. One of the most liked responses said: “Dignity is earned by oneself, not given by others.”But there were some dissenting voices amongst the comments: “This is just racism. We can see that Einstein is strong in physics but he doesn’t understand humans at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5067015df2e26abb579b68e9fd5ec021a62613a/0_0_4724_2836/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=495a9477444a8beceead098b5695a4b7","title":"matteo salvini from far right fringe player to strongman leader","story":"Migrant standoff has bolstered interior minister’s profile, leaving him unofficially playing PM’s roleMatteo Salvini is unofficially assuming the role of prime minister of Italy after a week in which a standoff over stranded migrants and a row with France has bolstered the interior minister’s profile and created the appearance he is setting the country’s agenda.The transformation of Salvini from far-right fringe candidate to popular strongman leader could have vast implications for the future of Italy, its role in Europe and the fragile alliance that now governs the country.His popularity has increased by about 10 percentage points since the 4 March election, which resulted in a hung parliament with his party, the League, placed second in terms of seats. It has also won him admiration from the biggest cheerleader in support of far-right populist movements in Europe. “He stepped up and took some pretty dramatic action. I don’t think it could have turned out better for him,” said Steve Bannon, the former adviser to US president Donald Trump who has spent time in Italy and been a vociferous supporter of the far-right surge.Analysts say Salvini’s rise reflects the fact that he is a skilled politician and is competing for attention against Giuseppe Conte, the law professor who was plucked out of obscurity and named prime minister after Salvini and Di Maio agreed neither of them would assume the role, but who is seen as weak.Salvini, a former talk radio host, has made a career out of demonising migrants. He made good on his campaign promise to crack down on irregular migration this week when, in his first major decision as interior minister, he blocked an NGO ship, the Aquarius, with more than 600 migrants on board from docking in Sicily.While the decision created a humanitarian crisis – Spain ultimately agreed to accept the migrants in Valencia – Salvini celebrated it as a big victory. When Italy’s refusal to accept the migrants elicited a sharp rebuke from Emmanuel Macron, the French president, it was seen among Italians as a deeply hypocritical response, given France’s reluctance to accept migrants and refugees.Stopping the Aquarius migrant vessel, Orsina said, had cost Salvini nothing, and the fight with Macron, even for those Italians who do not support the League, has garnered him even more support given the Italian view that the rest of the EU, and especially France, have left the country to deal with the migrant crisis on its own.“Many Italians will say they are not with Salvini but that against the French they are with him, because they will say that what Macron said is false, hypocritical, unbearable,” Orsina said. It was also possible that Salvini – like Matteo Renzi before him – could ride a wave of popularity that collapses, much like the former centre-left prime minister did, he said. Bannon, speaking to the , said he believed that Salvini had done a “great job” by taking on the issue of migration in the first weeks of the new government.“Particularly since it is the summer and the crisis is only going to continue. And he showed the complete hypocrisy of Macron, and I think it is important for the people of Italy to see that he is willing to stand up,” Bannon said. “It is a central part of why Macron is going to crash and burn, he’s all big talk.”For migrants who were rescued by the Aquarius, the decision led to even more hardship. The boat is not expected to arrive in Valencia until Saturday or Sunday, and there are multiple accounts that those onboard, who include children, are suffering intense seasickness. Their journey to Spain has also been interrupted by poor weather, and legal experts have accused Italy of breaking international humanitarian rules.Flavio Di Giacomo, the spokesman for the UN migration agency, the IOM, said it was not the first time that a boat had been blocked from entering Italy. “What has changed is that this time the public opinion is backing this kind of action, which in part is because the anti-NGO narrative has won in the public opinion,” said Di Giacomo. Salvini, and other Italian politicians, have argued that NGOs who rescue migrants represent a “pull factor”, encouraging African economic migrants to make the journey across the Mediterranean. But many migration experts have argued that poor conditions are forcing migrants to flee, and that the NGOs are saving lives.Within a government that has a share of eclectic personalities, including an undersecretary who believes the moon landing was a hoax, Salvini has stood out in part by setting the agenda in a way that focuses on issues he has control over.“He is making migration the most important issue of the country, and then it follows that the minister who handles migration is the most important leader,” said Sergio Fabbrini at Luiss University. “The Five Star Movement is without an agenda, without a strategy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52845ad01a8fbc1adb551e66345030bb9d41c344/0_181_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f33e8e3dc9f96b8f9188dc2eb8b535ec","title":"trans mountain pipeline first nations offer buy shares","story":"Despite high-profile protests some indigenous Canadians believe only way to mitigate environmental impacts is through ownershipAfter Justin Trudeau’s surprise announcement that the Canadian government would nationalize a contentious pipeline, indigenous protestors have been among the most vocal in their opposition to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, arguing that the project trespasses on their territory and poses a risk to the environment. Protests led by First Nations have amplified public unease of over the mega project – which will triple the flow of bitumen from Alberta to the coastal waters of British Columbia – as the country attempts to balance its fight against climate change with an economy driven largely by the energy industry.But the project may soon find an unlikely group of investors: both the Athabasca Tribal Council and the Athabasca River Métis Council – a consortium of 10 communities – have offered to buy equity in the pipeline.“This is not the indigenous community coming out and saying: ‘We’re pro pipeline.’ We’re pro Trans Mountain. We see the value in it,” said Ron Quintal, president of the Athabasca River Métis. “The only way we’re able to mitigate the environmental impacts is through ownership and having a say in these projects.” The two councils recently met with federal officials, including infrastructure minister Amarjeet Sohi to discuss their proposal. This will not be the first time Canada’s First Nations have invested in the fossil fuel industries which have encroached on their land and disrupted traditional ways of life. A large source of tension around Trans Mountain project centres on the idea of unceded lands: few formal treaties were ever signed between British Columbia’s colonial settlers and the indigenous population – whose descendants argue that they retain the right to control any development. And in a string of previous high-profile legal battles, courts have tended to recognize the broad powers of indigenous land title, giving First Nations a potential veto on development projects.The debate over Trans Mountain has intensified after British Columbia environmental officials recently announced that a spill from the pipeline in late May, which was initially reported to be 100 litres, was in fact 48 times larger.“Despite all this insanity that Justin Trudeau is speaking, the answer is still no, we will never allow a pipeline to come through British Columbia,” Elder Ta’ah Amy George of the costal Tsleil-Waututh said in a statement following the government purchase of the pipeline. The pipeline’s prior owner, Texas-based Kinder Morgan, actively courted indigenous support throughout the process, promising among other incentives, royalties and environmental safeguards.And according to Ernie Crey, chief of the Cheam First Nation, months of high-profile protests obscured the reality of support for the project.“We learn almost daily, as other First Nations speak out about it, that they’re quite comfortable with this pipeline and they’re looking forward to the benefits that will flow from its construction in terms of training, jobs and the opportunity to engage in the construction of it.” He told the  that his community was interested in potentially investing in the pipeline, but required more information on the project before making any commitments. To date, 43 First Nations out of more than 100 have signed agreements in support of the project.“We work very hard to ensure our territories are protected. We’re the stewards of the land,” said Quintal. “But at the same time, I need to make sure my members can put food on the table. I need to make sure they can get quality education and access to quality health care.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3530988.1528998171!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit call ireland s bluff on border rees mogg tells may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJacob Rees-Mogg: Britain should not do anything that risks security or damages the Irish economy. Photograph: PA WireThe European Union could ignore its own rules if it wants to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit and simply agree not to create one in any circumstances, the leading backbench Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has said.Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of pro-Brexit Tory MPs, said Theresa May should call Ireland’s bluff rather than allow the Border issue to hold Brexit to ransom.“Will the Irish put up a border? Will a government that has always believed there should be a single government across the whole island of Ireland suddenly put up a wall? Is it going to be a Trump-like wall built by Mr Varadkar?The British government has repeatedly said it will not impose a border, so it is entirely up to Mr Varadkar, ” he told The .“I think we can easily negotiate a deal on trade across the Border, but I don’t think this issue should hold us to ransom on doing everything else, which is what it’s currently being used for.I think we should simply make it clear that we will not put up a border and that is our position. And what would the Irish do if the EU insisted? I think that is a really interesting question. I think we should call that particular bluff.”Britain and the EU have agreed that there should be no return to a hard Border, and Ms May, the prime minister, has acknowledged that a unilateral British commitment not to create new barriers was not enough to resolve the issue.Mr Rees-Mogg said he disagreed with the prime minister and dismissed the EU’s argument that its rules demanded that it should police its external borders and protect the integrity of the single market and the customs union.“It wasn’t possible for Italy to join the euro. But lo and behold the rules were waived. It was not possible for Greece to join the euro, but lo and behold Goldman Sachs fiddled the figures and Greece joined. The four freedoms are inisible, except when it comes to the association agreement with Ukraine, when lo and behold the freedom of movement of people – oh dear, we are not going to have that,” he said.\u0026nbsp“This is one of those things we must not fall for. The EU says this is EU law. It is holy writ. Moses has brought it down from the Alps, when he was not busy in the Sinai, and therefore it must be obeyed. Whenever it is convenient to the European Union, European law is adjusted. It is political rather than legal.’’Mr Rees-Mogg said that, considering its long history with Ireland, Britain should not do anything that risks security or damages the Irish economy. He noted Britain’s importance as a trading partner for Ireland, particularly in agriculture, and warned of the consequences if the EU made Britain subject to the common external tariff.“There would be up to 70 per cent tariffs on Irish beef ... I cannot believe there is any wish that the Irish Government has any wish for any of this to happen. Therefore I think we have to be very clear and say: we are not going to have a border, we’re going to carry on trading freely with you, what are you going to do?’’Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPATheresa May has spent much of this week struggling to reconcile the two ends of her party over Brexit, shuttling between former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who leads the pro-European rebels, and Brexiteer shop steward Jacob Rees-Mogg. But for Rees-Mogg, the 49-year-old Somerset MP who chairs the European Research Group (ERG) of up to 60 hard Brexiteers, negotiating with the EU couldn’t be simpler.“I think there’s a very straightforward deal actually. I think what we should say to the EU is: here’s £39 billion, and here’s a trade deal,” he says, forming each of his hands into a fist to demonstrate.\u0026nbsp“If you give us one, we’ll give you the other. If you don’t give us the other, we won’t give you one. And then, for 21 months of the multiannual financial framework negotiation, you’re going to have to get more money from other member states.”Once caricatured as a backbench Bertie Wooster on account of his fogeyish style, elongated vowels and reactionary outlook, Rees-Mogg is today one of the most influential MPs at Westminster. A consistent poll-topper in Conservative Home’s surveys of party members on who should be their next leader, he leads a caucus that could hold the prime minister’s fate in its hands.Rees-Mogg, whose father William edited the London Times and went on to become a Conservative peer, made a fortune estimated in the tens of millions of pounds before becoming an MP. This week, it emerged that his investment company\u0026nbspSomerset Capital Management had launched a new investment vehicle in Dublin, which advised investors that a hard Brexit\u0026nbspcould affect it adversely. In any case, he doesn’t believe in the downside economic risks to Brexit, despite a warning from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) that a hard exit from the EU could wipe out entire sectors of the British economy.“The CBI represents incumbents. It doesn’t represent challengers, it doesn’t represent competition and if you represent incumbents, of course you want to maintain the cosy cartel that keeps prices high. But I’m on the side of my voters who are consumers and consumers want lower prices, lower tariffs, less obstructions to trade therefore non-tariff barriers too,” he says.For Rees-Mogg, leaving the EU is about much more than economics or day-to-day politics, it is about democracy itself. He says one of the most important questions every member of parliament faces is whether he can seek redress of grievance for his constituents.“And you can’t once it’s a European competence. Whereas when it’s a British competence you can raise it in the House of Commons, you can introduce a bill if you want to change the law. You have an active way of seeking redress of grievance for your constituents,” he says.The European Parliament is not, he claims, “a serious parliament” or a proper democratic forum because it doesn’t represent a single people.\u0026nbsp“There are the peoples of Europe, there’s not a single European people. If there were a European people, the Germans wouldn’t mind subsidising the Greeks. But they hate it,” he says.So is there a single British people? And is everyone in Northern Ireland part of it?“Yes there is. By a long-established history. Northern Ireland is part of the UK,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Some of them wish to leave. And they have, under the Belfast Agreement, the right to a referendum under certain circumstances”.But the agreement also gives them the right to identify as British or Irish or both, which would suggest that some of them have the right not to be part of the British people?“Well they have a vote in the British election but they don’t have to use it. We don’t have compulsory voting, and I don’t think we should,” he says.“I believe in the concept of nation-state. I think that’s where power validly belongs. And the people who belong to that nation-state have rights and duties within that nation-state, and the democracy applies to them. But I don’t believe that there is a European people that is willing to accept the burdens required for a single state.”“We would be in an association with it, which would not make us subject to the ECJ, the ECJ would have no writ in the UK, it would have a writ in the chemicals agency. And that is different from the current position where if the ECJ ruled on the chemicals agency that would automatically be UK law. Under those circumstances, it would not be UK law and could not affect what happened in the UK unless we decided that it would,” he says.“Voluntary alignment is fine because you can decide not to align if you think the regulation is going wrong,” he says.What Rees-Mogg is describing is similar to Switzerland’s relationship with the EU, which is governed by numerous bilateral treaties that offer the Swiss a measure of sovereignty in theory but leaves them in reality as rule-takers from Brussels.Despite the current chaos in Westminster and the slow progress of negotiations in Brussels, he believes that May will secure a deal from the EU.“My guess is that there will be a deal. I’m in favour of a deal but I’m not frightened of leaving without it,” he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

This year is on track to overtake 2017, when 879 branches closed their doors for good, the research found.Access to banking services is further under threat from the possibility of cash machines being removed from communities as the result of changes to the way banks pay operators.This could lead to an estimated 2.7 million people who are almost totally reliant on cash struggling to access their preferred method of payment.Between the start of 2015 and the end of 2018, 2,868 bank branches will have closed, the research found.The worst hit region is Scotland which will have seen 368 branches close in that period.Elsewhere, banks have closed 361 branches in the Southeast of England, 353 in the Northwest and 327 in the Southwest.

Which? money expert, Gareth Shaw, said: “Bank branch closures are happening at an alarming rate –\u0026nbspwith almost 60 shutting every month – stripping customers and communities of access to the financial services they need.“While the decision is clearly a commercial one for a bank to take, it is also crucial that banks do recognise the needs of their customers and the communities they serve, before simply shutting their doors –\u0026nbspand their customers out.”Standards introduced in 2015 require banks to engage with their customers and communities they serve ahead of planned closures. The consumer group said this means that there should be a “robust consultation” with a bank’s customers before financial services are removed from an area.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelClick to followThe Independent OnlineSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autismStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”Nutritionist reveals truth about health benefits of soya foodsWhen kids run for 15 minutes in school every day, here’s what happens How the military is helping tackle mental health problems Graphic cigarette-style health warnings also effective on sugary drinkPeople without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra.

And that is something that I hear up and down the country.”Charities who work directly with claimants on a day-to-day basis\u0026nbsprepudiated the claims, saying universal credit was having a devastating impact on many vulnerable people and that there was a lack of focus on people with additional needs.It comes after the\u0026nbspNational Audit Office (NAO)\u0026nbspfound the new benefit was failing to deliver value for money and pushing claimants into debt, rent arrears and dependence on food banks as a result of delays.The damning assessment stated that universal credit may cost more than the social security system it replaces – and warned there was no way of measuring whether it will ever meet its economic aim of getting 200,000 more people into work.\u0026nbspThe report followed a High Court ruling\u0026nbspon Thursday which found the rollout had unlawfully discriminated\u0026nbspagainst people with disabilities by taking “essential benefits” from claimants, in the first legal test it has faced.Responding to Ms Sharma’s comments\u0026nbspJames Taylor, head of policy and public affairs at disability charity Scope, said: “In contrary to this, today’s report shows universal credit is having a devastating impact on many disabled people.“It comes just a day after a High Court judge said the system was unlawfully discriminating against disabled people – the government cannot bury its head in the sand.\u0026nbspIt needs to recognise the impact these flaws are having on disabled people’s lives, and take urgent action to fix these problems.”Kayley Hignell, head of\u0026nbspfamilies welfare and work policy at Citizens\u0027 Advice, told The Independent the organisation was\u0026nbspseeing\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspgood proportion of people really struggling after being transferred to universal credit.These are often the people who have additional needs –\u0026nbspfrom carers to those who have a disability to those who have high childcare costs, she said.Universal credit needs to work across the board, from people who have simple needs, to those with more complex needs. The NAO confirmed that one in five are\u0026nbsp not being paid in full or on time, and if you look at the data, it is\u0026nbspquite clear that it\u0027s those who have additional support needs are\u0026nbspthose who\u0026nbspare struggling most.Getting payment on time is really critical for these people.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s unacceptable that it\u0027s not working for so many.Following the NAO report,\u0026nbspLabour MP Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee condemned the DWP’s “constant” assertion that “everything is going well“ and that any criticism comes from those who “wish to make trouble for universal credit”.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesBritish singer Robbie Williams performs during the opening ceremony of the 2018 World Cup at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.Prince Charles uses a power drill during a visit to the Owenkillew Community Centre in Gortin, as part of his tour of Northern Ireland.England manager Gareth Southgate, his players and coaching staff pose for the official England squad photo ahead of traveling to the World Cup in Russia.Play was suspended during the match between Lancashire and Essex as an Air Ambulance landed on the pitch after one of the spectators was taken ill on day three of the Specsavers County Championship, Division One match at Emirates Old Trafford, Manchester.Marchers hold up banners as they gather to mark 100 years since women won the right to vote in the UK.The parade makes its way up The Mall from Horse Guards Parade to Buckingham Palace, central London, following the Trooping the Colour ceremony, as the Queen celebrates her official birthday.

But the EU has said a withdrawal deal needs to be finalised before October this year to give it time to be ratified before the exit date.\u0026nbspTalks are currently floundering on the issue of the Northern Ireland border and how to avoid controls reappearing after the UK leaves. The EU hoped the solve the issue by the next European Council summit due later this month, but this now looks a long way off, in part because of rows in Ms May’s own cabinet and party.\u0026nbspIt is possible to extend Article 50 to allow more time for negotiations to take placeBack in Westminster MPs including Tory rebels, are currently locked in a struggle with the Government over how big a say Parliament will have in the event a no deal.

It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.Click here to play our Love Island games - and win a £10,000 holiday for you and three friendsThere’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

Without that ultimate weapon we are certain to get a poor deal.The Prime Minister cannot accept what a small handful of Remainers determined to stop Brexit are demanding.As she has rightly said, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.The people said leave, not leave when the EU gives us permission.The EU Withdrawal Bill, which MPs voted on this week, is about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure.Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Government on this key bill, cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.If Conservatives do not demonstrate discipline in support of Theresa May on this, then we risk letting him into power.The Government has already said the EU Withdrawal Bill can be framed so as to give Parliament a vote on the final outcome, but without blocking the UK’s departure even without a deal.The Bill will go back to the House of Lords on Monday, and is likely then to return to the House of Commons.We need to get this out of the way, because it is 14 months on from triggering Article 50 and we still have not discussed the vital trade relationship between the UK and the EU.This is because the EU Commission deliberately set out to ensnare the UK in a tortuous bureaucratic process designed to leave us in the weakest position, bound to the EU as some sort of vassal state — as a rule-taker.In this, the EU has been emboldened by the appalling behaviour of the unelected House of Lords, which made it clear they want to reverse the result of the referendum. One peer even spoke arrogantly of now bringing the British people to heel.You only need to have watched as the EU’s negotiators have gratuitously and remorselessly set out not just to be difficult but, it has become clear, to humiliate us.For example, their refusal to agree to our continuing involvement in the Galileo satellite project, despite the fact that we have invested heavily in it, demonstrates how their behaviour has been calculated to offend.Even the UK’s offer of defence intelligence co-operation, which the EU needs, was brushed aside.That the EU is now strutting like the school bully should not surprise us, because of its ideological commitment to the European project at all costs.Yet, for all their bluster, this masks a weakness.The EU is deeply worried the UK will leave the EU and become a serious trade competitor, thus not only damaging the EU’s trading position but encouraging those in the EU who oppose this centralised, protectionist behemoth.We have reached a critical moment in the Brexit process. Because of the EU’s inflexibility, the Government has been forced to make concessions in the hope of discussing that all-important trade relationship.This has left many of us concerned that the process has been too one-sided.The UK has been behaving as a friend who wants an amicable divorce, while the EU has behaved like an opponent who wishes to impose their will and force the UK to repent what they believe is the folly of Brexit.That is why the UK needs now to change its negotiating stance, once the Brexit bill is passed.Too often it seems as though it is the UK which negotiates as a supplicant — despite the reality that, as the EU’s largest trade partner and the fifth largest economy in the world, with the world’s fourth most potent defence forces, the UK is deserving of much more respect from the EU.After all, there is a great deal at stake for the EU if these negotiations go wrong.There are many among the EU 27 who, like us, are growing weary of the EU’s arrogance. After all, it is many of them who stand to lose jobs if we fail to reach a trade arrangement.The EU Council meeting later this month has now become critical. It is there we should say that, notwithstanding any ongoing issues concerning the Irish border, our requirement is we move now to negotiate our post-Brexit trade relationship.If they refuse, and want instead to continue their border demands, then we must have the resolve to leave the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So far all I’ve come up with is Iggle Piggle, from TV’s In The Night Garden.I think negotiating Brexit would be a stretch for the friendly blue woollen creature with the red Mohawk.But maybe I’ve got him wrong, underestimated his abilities. He has a bell in his left foot. Theresa May seems to have a brain in her left foot. Given the choice, maybe I’d take the kid with the bell.We are in chaos. Not because we voted for Brexit, far from it. The economy is doing well. The sky has not fallen in. Investment up, employment hitting record levels, inflation down.No, the problem is solely a consequence of our Government. Right now we don’t know exactly what deals have been done with the rump of Remainers within the Conservative Party.One moment we’re told the Prime Minister has caved in to their demands. Next minute she hasn’t. Nobody knows quite what to believe.She is tip-toeing between the two sides solely to stay in power. And she has to be told: It isn’t working. It sends out a message to the people we are negotiating with that we haven’t a clue what’s going on.That policy is formulated on the hoof. In fact, it’s not policy at all, just inept fire-fighting. Inept because the flames are spreading — and as a result, our negotiating position becomes weaker by the hour.Some will argue May can only play the cards she has been dealt. That she has a minority Government and a split in her own party.Well, sure. But then, to a considerable degree, she dealt the cards herself. She called an election a year ago expecting to get a huge majority.I could have told her she would lose, if she’d asked. But she didn’t ask me, she asked some other numbnuts instead. This holy mess is of her making.Britain voted to leave the EU. Not to stay in bits of it. Not to remain constrained by the EU’s regulations. The Remainers don’t like that?Don’t care. You lost the argument — so shut up for a while. Or work to get us the best deal we can, outside the customs union.We need to be clear to the EU negotiators that we will happily take a no deal Brexit. They don’t want that — and a tough line will make them respond. If it doesn’t — fine, no deal is still much better than a bad deal.The EU is falling apart, largely for the reasons that convinced us to leave. Bullying, dictatorial, corrupt, undemocratic.We need a leader who can exploit their manifest weaknesses. A lot — perhaps a majority — of European people are on our side.That leader isn’t Theresa May. It needs to be someone within the Tories who is A. a Leave voter and B. has a bit of charisma and nous.I don’t really care who, right now, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Michael Gove. But ABM — Anyone But May.It is not the EU that is hampering our exit strategy. It is our own Govern­ment. It’s time for Theresa to say: “That’s it: I’m out.”Now, quiz fans, here’s a question for you. What do Terry and Andraya possess that may have helped them come first and second?Jet-powered roller skates? Performance- enhancing drugs? Nope.They were both born with male bodies. And they both competed as boys until very recently.But according to the growing trend, they are now able to identify as girls without question.

The only tips we actually get are cash.I have just left this company as 70% of the card tips and 10% service charges go directly to the owners and are used to pay the salaried staff their wages.At the end of every night Albert’s take a percentage of our sales off us. Whether we have actually made the tips or not, they take a cut of everything we have sold from us that day. So theoretically we could end up paying out of our own pocket.“Then every fortnight we get a cheque showing us how much money we have made on card tips and then it shows the massive reduction that goes to ‘Albert’s house’ and the disheartening figure that we are actually coming away with.Payslips shared in the post show one example of £517.19 of tips earned in the financial year but £378.48 deducted to House Didsbury and another £75.70 to Kitchen Tip.Another employee, who wished to remain anonymous, provided a slip showing £138.30 of tips and deductions of £334.92 to House Didsbury and Kitchen Tip - resulting in take-home pay of £6.75 from £343.27 of earnings.James Ramsbottom, owner of Elle R Leisure who are behind Albert’s said today: “I cannot comment on specific allegations as that is now a legal matter.“However more than 90% of tips earned, go to staff on site.“Very occasionally, staff have been asked to contribute towards mistakes made but this has only amounted, in total, to £170 in the last 12 months. Again this system is in place to ensure good service.“If a server makes persistent errors, it can massively affect service, not just to the table in question, but the whole restaurant. However this is very rarely used and is at the discretion of the manager.”Tips are given voluntarily by customers to staff as a reward for the service theyve received.These tips can be kept by the employee, although technically they should be declared for income tax.If cash tips are placed into a central collection and distributed equally among staff, this should not be done by the employer.However, tips included in card payments are handled by the restaurant and can be pooled together and shared out among staff.Service charges are compulsory additions to a restaurant bill, typically for serving a large group, which are paid directly to the venue.With card payments and service charges there is no legal obligation for the restaurant to allocate a proportion of the service charge to employees. In August 2015, Elle R Leisure admitted that staff at Albert’s did not get all of their tips.The company said that some larger parties have a 10 per cent service charge added to the bill and part of that is kept by the company.They claimed this is used to pay for ‘staff welfare items’ - such as nights out, food and drinks and training for employees.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nor for that matter will value for money.”Some £1.9 billion has been spent so far on UC.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “While Universal Credit is working well for some, more than a quarter of a million people are expected to wait longer than five weeks for their first full payment.“This puts them at risk of falling behind on bills and getting into debt - a heavy price to pay for a system that isn’t working properly.”Last night a DWP spokesman said: “We are building a benefit system fit for the 21st century, providing flexible, person-centred support, with evidence showing Universal Credit claimants getting into work faster and staying in work longer.“Universal Credit is good value for money and is forecast to realise a return on investment of £34bn over ten years against a cost of £2bn, with 200,000 more people in work.“Furthermore 83 per cent of claimants are satisfied with the service and the majority agree that it ‘financially motivates’ them to work.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Late payments were delayed on average by four weeks.From January to October last year, 40% of those affected by late payments waited around 11 weeks or more, and 20% waited nearly five months.The report authors found the use of foodbanks increased more rapidly after universal credit was rolled out to an area.\"The benefits that it set out to achieve through universal credit, such as increased employment and lower administration costs, are unlikely to be achieved. Yet the Department has little realistic alternative but to continue with the programme and hopefully learn from past mistakes.\"The NAO also found the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) had not shown \"sufficient sensitivity\" towards some claimants and that it does not know how many are having problems with the programme or have suffered hardship.Reacting to the report, Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, said: \"This report blows up the DWP\u0027s constant assertion that everything is going well and that any criticism comes from those who wish to make trouble for universal credit.\"The points that individuals have raised with the select committee are now writ large as systemic faults within the system and the government is caught in a trap of its own making.\"The universal credit we have seen is a shambles, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.

Wilko has a fantastic range of presents perfect for green-fingered dads. And best of all, they won\u0027t break the bank as all come in at under \u0026pound15 each. As well as picking our favourite half dozen, we\u0027ve also detailed how to use each item to its full potential to help your dad transform his garden with ease.  They include everything from beds and pots to award-winning gadgets - now all you have to worry about is getting him a card! 1 - Wilko garden tool handle, \u0026pound4  This amazing gadget is so groundbreaking (excuse the pun) that it actually won a 2017 Red Dot award for design and innovation. It attaches to long-handled gardening tools such as rakes or garden brushes to add an extra handle, making it easier to manoeuver the devices. No wonder the judges praised it as a ‘simple and innovative solution’ to an age-old gardening problem. 2 - Wilko angled raised bed, \u0026pound12    Whether you want to try your hand at creating a vegetable, herb or salad garden, or just add additional flowering space in a small area, wilko’s angled raised bed could be the answer. It’s perfect for those with back and knee problems, eliminating cumbersome crawls on the ground. Whatever your gardening issue, this hack’s got it covered. 3 - Wilko drainpipe pot holders in black, green and aubergine, \u0026pound2.50  Whether you’re trying to turn a tiny back yard into a stunning green garden, or prettify a drab space, these clever drainpipe pot holders can help you do it. The holder attaches to most round drainpipes (68mm), so all you need to add is a matching plant pot (sold separately) and you’re good to grow. With a choice of black, green and aubergine colours to choose from, and no hooks, drills or holes required, this could quite possibly be the easiest way to brighten up your outdoor space. 4 - Wilko hanging plant pots in black, green and aubergine, \u0026pound5  Bring on the Hanging Gardens of Babylon with this innovative solution to creating gardens in limited spaces. Easily attached to most fences and balconies (fits up to 50mm panels), the small reservoir in the bottom of these hanging pots also keeps plants hydrated for longer by providing a water source whenever it’s needed, so you won’t have to water as often. Available in black, green and aubergine, fill with your favourite plants and watch your garden bloom. 5 - Wilko terracotta patio plant pot Camper Bella Misto 25cm, \u0026pound3.50  These pretty pots don’t just look good – they’re actually live savers when it comes to plants. The porous nature of terracotta allows air and water to pass through the walls of the pot, allowing plants to thrive by staving off diseases caused by overwatering. These containers are frost resistant too, adding extra protection during cold spells. As far as we’re concerned, it’s the niftiest plant-saving device on the market. 6 - Wilko PVC cloche greenhouse with two openings, H60 x W120 x D60cm, \u0026pound10  If spring frosts kill off your attempts to grow flowers before they even get off the ground, this frost-resistant mini-greenhouse could be the answer. It offers everything a traditional greenhouse does, just on a smaller scale. So think seed propagation, insect protection, and a bright, warm environment in which plants can grow before graduating to outdoors. All at a fraction of the price (and size) of classic versions.

The softly-spoken, owlish lawyer couldn\u0027t have found a more mismatched sparring partner than the blunt ardent Brexiteer.

The spending watchdog found it has not delivered value for money, its rollout has been slower and costlier than promised, and it\u0027s caused hardship for many people. It\u0027s a devastating blow to the six-in-one benefit that was announced in 2010 as the pet project of former Tory welfare chief Iain Duncan Smith. It has since been taken over by a string of Work and Pension Secretaries and now rests in the hands of Tory Esther McVey. Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Select Committee, today brands the benefit a “shambles, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake”. And campaigners have used the report to call for reform of the benefit, which has already cost the state \u0026pound1.9bn to date.  Here are 5 of the most devastating findings in the report.  Last year along a quarter of new claims were not paid in full on time - a total of 113,000. And from January to October 2017, 40% of those affected by late payments waited for 11 weeks or more. A fifth of those with late payments waited almost five months. But despite improvements, in March this year 21% of new claimants did not receive their full entitlement on time with 13% receiving no payment on time. The DWP does not anticipate that delays will improve this year, the NAO said. And the DWP believes it will never achieve 100% payment on time because of the need to verify claimants\u0027 eligibility, the NAO warned. 2. It\u0027s taking far, far longer than expected  It\u0027s hard to believe it now, but Universal Credit was originally due to be rolled out fully by October 2017. Yet eight years after it was announced, only around 10% of the final expected caseload are currently claiming Universal Credit. There have been a string of delays and it\u0027s now due to end by March 2022. 3. It\u0027s could cost even more than the old system  The NAO said the system\u0027s running costs are currently \u0026pound699 per claim - against an ambition of \u0026pound173 by 2024. And it warned UC may cost more to administer than the system it replaced, which included job seeker\u0027s allowance, tax credit and housing benefit. Universal Credit has not delivered value for money and it is uncertain that it ever will, the NAO said. The project is not value for money now, and that its future value for money is unproven. 4. Its entire selling point could be an empty promise  Universal Credit was sold to the nation on the basis it will encourage people into work. That\u0027s because it is designed to make work pay by ensuring people aren\u0027t accidentally penalised for every extra hour they work.  However, the NAO said we doubt it will ever be possible for the DWP to measure if Universal Credit has increased the number of people in work. 5. It drives people to food banks - and the DWP\u0027s in denial  Since the introduction of UC there have been increases in rent arrears and the use of food banks, the NAO reported. The watchdog added private landlords have become reluctant to rent homes to people on the flahship benefit. In three of the four areas the NAO visited that had proper data, foodbank use increased quicker after Universal Credit was rolled out fully. But the report warned the DWP does not accept that Universal Credit has caused hardship among claimants. The Department has not shown sufficient sensitivity towards some claimants, the NAO said. It does not know how many claimants are having problems with the programme or have suffered hardship. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, warned the DWP has shown a lack of regard in failing to understand the hardship faced by some claimants. But we\u0027re so far down the track, there\u0027s no way it can stop  NAO chief Amyas Morse added: The benefits that it set out to achieve through Universal Credit, such as increased employment and lower administration costs, are unlikely to be achieved. Yet the Department has little realistic alternative but to continue with the programme and hopefully learn from past mistakes.”   How have campaigners reacted?

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) announced last month they would withdraw from a court battle with two chronically ill people, AN and JM, who wanted higher Personal Independence Payments (PIP). One of the pair is severely diabetic and has to be watched at night to avoid slipping into a deadly coma. The pair\u0027s lawyers argued that this need for an observer counted as therapy - which would, in turn, give the claimant higher PIP. Ms McVey today confirmed the DWP had backed down in the case, and the two people involved will be paid extra PIP within days.

Spotted Dick has been a source of amusement for diners for years, but it seems none are finding it more amusing than MPs - so much so that waiters won\u0027t say the name of the dessert in the Houses of Parliament. Staff working in Strangers\u0027 Dining Room in the Commons have taken to calling the pud \u0027Spotted Richard\u0027 to save those dining from their blushes.  Four staff working in the restaurant confirmed the name change, reports The  .  They added that this was to avoid causing a stir among guests.  However regular diners in the restaurant have branded the rename silly on social media. Conservative MP for Morley and Outwood, Andrea Jenkins told The  she had to bite on her lip to stop from laughing when a waiter offered her a slice of Spotted Richard earlier this week. She added: I had to ask twice, just to be sure. They have a traditional desserts selection, which changes daily, so I asked what the dessert was and that\u0027s when they said it. I still have no idea why. Other MPs have not taken the situation so lightly. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage blasted the rebrand, calling it PC baloney.  Social media users have also chimed in on the conversation, with many of the opinion it is a childish move. One Twitter user wrote: If some MPs are giggling at Spotted Dick as a pudding then this is proof that the HoP really are like a primary school playground - absolutely pathetic and embarrassing. Another added: What will be next - not being able to fill tarts with cream? A spokesman for the House of Commons denied that the name had been changed but later added: We are not always able to control how staff may refer to dishes.

CCTV shows how the rival gangs lashed out at each other with a flurry of kicks and punches inside McDonald\u0027s in Penge, south-east London, knocking over an elderly woman during the melee. The teenagers, armed with knives, race into the takeaway, attempting to stab each other, and continue to fight in the doorway and outside on the pavement. One of the participants of the violence was later jailed for his part in the fatal stabbing of 17-year-old Karl Yule in Gillingham, Kent on October.  Tyler Ralph, from Hetfordshire, will now serve a life sentence with a minimum of 16 years for the killing of Mr. Yule Judge Adele Williams drew attention to his history of violence with knives - he was also convicted for possession of a blade in 2014 - when she sentenced him at Maidstone Crown Court on Thursday.  Aged just 16 at the time, he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, affray and possession of a blade for the incident. Judge Adele Williams drew attention to his history of violence with knives - he was also convicted for possession of a blade in 2014 - when she sentenced him at Maidstone Crown Court on Thursday to detention for life with a minimum term of 16 years after the murder of Mr Yule. She told the court how he and his four other co-defendants all regularly carried knives, and videos of Ralph found on his phone showed him with a fearsome array of knives and weapons.  In other footage, which can now be published, he films himself picking up with a gloved hand an array of weapons laid out on a bed, and brandishing a sword.  All of the footage was shown in court to a jury weeks ago as part of the trial but the press were prevented from publishing it until now.  A court order continues to prevent the press fully identifying Ralph and any of his fellow co-defendants who are still under the age of 18.  They can now be named, and the town in which they lived reported, but their faces must be obscured in any images or footage used and their street address must not be published, Judge Williams said.

Victim Nigel Hassall, 36, said Gavin Murphy, 27, led him to believe that they were in love. But their relationship took a violent turn when Murphy kneed Mr Hassall in the face - knocking out his two front teeth - and then punched him and bit him.  The victim was left badly injured and has now bravely spoken out after his attacker was jailed for 12 months, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.  A court heard the pair had a sexual relationship although Murphy denied this was the case.  Mr Hassall said: Gavin beat me up, it was like something you would see on a TV show. It will cost me thousands to repair the damage the assault did because I will have to get my teeth done - it\u0027s horrible. We were in a pretend relationship together, because it turned out he was straight. He had me believe we were in a relationship but now he says he\u0027s not gay. I suppose I will just have to move on. It seems like something you would make a film out of rather than the reality. When I first met him we were neighbours and he was with a lady at the time. We then fell in love, but that turned out to be just a lie. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard Murphy had arranged to stay with his victim in Leek, Staffordshire for a few days on March 5 but decided to leave after 15 minutes. Murphy then launched his attack after Mr Hassall went after him mistakenly thinking he had taken his phone.

Summer Grant passed away in hospital after she was rescued from the inflatable at an Easter Fair in Harlow, Essex, on March 26, 2016. Husband and wife fairground workers William and Shelby Thurston were handed a sentence of three years each today.  Summer\u0027s mum Cara Blackie has told Chelmsford Crown Court today how she screamed when a nurse phoned her while she was in a taxi to tell her that her daughter had died. In a heartbreaking statement, she said: I never thought that my Summer playing and having fun on the bouncy castle would end her young life. Her dad Lee Grant said: When Summer died, I felt as if I died too. I felt as if I had nothing left to live for because she was my beautiful angel. A court heard how the day after her death, younger sister Lily was told that Summer was up in the sky.  That night, her mother saw her staring out the window in their hotel room. She said: “I’m saying goodnight to Summer.” During sentencing remarks, a court was told: It does not bear thinking about what that little girl went through inside that bouncy castle. A trial previously heard the inflatable rolled up to 15 times in the air after it came off the ground. It was said to have blown 15ft in the air and landed 300m away.   William and Shelby Thurston had denied manslaughter by gross negligence and a health and safety offence at a previous hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court.  But after a three-week trial a jury found them both guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence last month. The couple, from Wilburton, near Ely, Cambridgeshire, were also found guilty of failure to discharge a duty under section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. During the sentencing remarks today, a judge told the Thurstons they had put children at real risk of harm. The judge added that it was only good fortune that Summer\u0027s sister Lily was not also inside the bouncy castle, Essex Live reports.  Her mum Cara\u0027s statement in court today said: I was home watching a film when my phone rang. It was Tasha Stephens and she was crying and not making much sense. I could not make sense what was going on. My heart sank. I just wanted to be there for my little girl. We called a taxi to take us to Harlow. All sorts of things were going through my head but not that my daughter would die. After being in the taxi for 15 minutes a nurse called and told me Summer had died. I screamed. Cara described how before Summer\u0027s funeral, she painted her daughter\u0027s nails blue - her favourite colour. She also put her glittery shoes in the coffin - the ones that Summer wanted to wear on her first night out. The court heard that since Summer\u0027s death, Cara has suffered from anxiety and depression which has made everyday life very hard.  The schoolgirl, from Norwich, had been at the fair with her father Lee and other family members. We all have to live with this for the rest of our lives,” a statement on behalf of Lee read out in the courtroom today said. Family members of the Thurstons burst into tears as the sentences were passed. In the sentencing remarks, the fairground workers were told: This was not simple negligence. This was gross negligence. Your breaches of duty were not just serious mistakes. Your conduct was so bad that in the jury’s view, it must be regarded as criminal. At the heart was your failure to have any sensible regard for the weather. High winds had been predicted for days. You knew that or should have known that. You were putting your customers, and by customers I mean children like Summer and Lily, at real risk of harm.”  The judge said the fairground workers had failed to ensure the dome was adequately anchored to the ground and to monitor the weather conditions to ensure they were suitable.  They were told: You were both directly responsible for this. You failed to ensure that the dome was properly secured to the ground. The evidence as to the number of anchorage points out of the available 17 that were in fact used is somewhat opaque. That being so, I cannot conclude that you failed to use all 17 and I proceed on the basis you did. But you did not use the upper four anchorage points with which the dome was fitted.  I find as a fact that that is what those tags were for and I find that you were in breach of your duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act in not doing so. The judge paid tribute to the dignity shown by Summer\u0027s family during the trial.  Shortly before 4.15pm the East of England Ambulance service had received a call and they attended with commendable speed, the court heard.  Summer was taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital by ambulance where tragically, she died from multiple injuries she sustained as the dome careered down the hill.  Dad Lee had run after the inflatable, which was lifted off the ground by wind while Summer was playing on it, jurors have previously been told. Ms Ayling earlier told the court that Mr Grant ran after the SuperDome as it lifted into the air. The prosecution lawyer said: “Lee Grant heard his mother scream ‘No!’. He turned and saw the dome inflatable had lifted into the air, appeared to hit a caravan before flipping over. “He shouted: ‘My daughter is in that’, and ran after it, but it was moving to fast for him to catch it. “Another woman who was at pet’s corner could see the top of the SuperDome as it was lifting in the air. “It was cartwheeling and only stopped when it crashed into a fence at the bottom of the park.” Summer suffered serious injuries during the incident and died just a few hours later.  Speaking after the guilty verdicts, Nicola Rutter from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: William and Shelby Thurston failed to ensure that the bouncy castle was adequately anchored to the ground and failed to monitor the weather conditions to ensure that it was safe to have it in use. They denied their actions were negligent but the CPS and the police built a strong case, together with assistance from the Health and Safety Executive, and demonstrated to the jury that the Thurstons had breached their duty of care to Summer. Our thoughts are with Summer\u0027s family and friends. During the trial, Chelmsford Crown Court heard from witnesses who claimed the bouncy castle was blown to the top of trees. Ben Mansfield was at the funfair with his wife and son on the day that Summer died.

Laura Ashton, 22, was getting ready for the school-run with daughters Millie, five, and Gracie-May, one, when she says she made the shocking discovery. Noticing her toddler needed changing, the mum-of-two rushed into the living room and picked up the next nappy out of the \u0026pound4.98 Asda Little Angels 72-pack. But the support worker from Stafford, Staffordshire, explained how she noticed a small dark mark underneath the topsheet of the disposable nappy. Tearing the nappy open Laura was shocked to pull out a sharp, mysterious object.  She has since called on safer regulations to be put in place in the manufacturing process of babies’ nappies. “I had just finished getting Millie’s bag ready for school before I realised Gracie-May needed changing, she said. “I walked into the living room and picked out the next nappy from the pack. “As I opened it up I noticed something dark in the middle so rubbed my fingers across it.  “It felt quite pointy so I told Millie to film me opening it up. “After a few seconds I managed to tear out a sharp, dark object. It felt quite light but it was really sharp. “At first I thought it was a piece of machinery but God knows what it was. “Millie was shouting ‘chuck it in the fire’. We then started going through a few more to see if anything else dangerous was lurking in there. “I’m just so shocked. If I hadn’t spotted it that could have pierced through and really hurt Gracie-May.” Laura contacted Asda after finding the object on Monday morning. “I phoned up customer services to make a complaint and they just told me to go back to my local store”, she said. “I marched down there and was just handed another 72-pack of nappies. As if I’m going to use them! “It’s outrageous. I’ll never buy them again.” Laura shared her terrifying discovery on Facebook, clocking up 430,000 views and 6,000 shares.

One shopper, who asked not to be named, told Wales Online : It\u0027s terrible what I saw. There was kids in the background and walking past.  The original photo has been shared over 1,400 times and received comments of outrage and concern. One user wrote: I\u0027m too scared to walk around there in the day. Absolutely disgusting.  Another wrote: Shocking and upsetting and the fact Bridgend has already got a bad reputation, how are the good people supposed to make our town better? Clearly these people have their issues. Go on take your last ounce of respect and do it somewhere else. Spice is usually a mix of herbs or shredded plant material with man-made mind-altering chemicals sprayed on to them. It is marketed as an alternative to cannabis by drug dealers but, chemically, the two drugs are very different. Cannabis comes from a plant, but Spice is a “synthetic cannabinoid”, a family of around 700 research chemicals. Although it is sold to look like cannabis, the effects come from the chemicals.  Because there are over 700 types, any of which can be used to create Spice, the effects of the drug can vary massively depending on which compounds have been used in its production. Only last month, Logan Johns-Evans, 11, was left like a zombie after it was claimed that a rolly cigarette he had been smoking was laced with the synthetic drug without his knowledge.

Kyle Yule was murdered after being spotted sat alone in a silver Renault Clio when it was surrounded by the five thugs who smashed the windows and slashed a tyre .  New video which can only be shown for the first time today shows how they chased him down a street - before stabbing him to death. Kyle ran from the car to a friend’s house but as he banged on the door was knifed five times by the gang who ignored his pleas for mercy. A court heard how he was heard pleading with gang leader and pharmaceutical science student Victor Maibvisira, 19, known as Vee: “Vee stop, I’ve had enough. I get the point.” One of the knife blows from Maibvisira pieced his right armpit and severed an artery.  The hooded and masked teenagers then fled on foot or bikes, leaving Kyle bleeding to death in the front garden. He died on the operating table The murder in Gillingham in Kent last October was a culmination of a feud when the gang accused one of Kyle\u0027s friends of stealing a bike. Just five days before the murder CCTV captured Maibvisira, Ephrain Akinwunmi-Streets, 17, and Shezakia Daley, 18, attempted to attack two men outside a pub with machetes, knives and a belt. All five admitted being there but denied stabbing Kyle. Maibvisira and Daleywere were the only two to give evidence, each blaming the other for inflicting the fatal blow. But after a trial at Maidstone Crown Court all five were convicted of murder and sentenced today.  Maibvisira was handed the longest minimum sentence of 24 years while Akinwunmi-Streets, Daley, Tyler Ralph, 17, and Jordan Dania, 16, were given a minimum of 16 years. Kyle\u0027s mother Nikki Yule wept as she read out a moving victim impact statement to the packed court the murder of her eldest child of four was savage She told the five teenagers: The night you took the life of my beautiful loved son has ruined my family\u0027s life forever. Ms Yule said Kyle was looking forward to his 18th birthday in November last year, but never got to celebrate it.  He said “His funeral was two days after his birthday. To those involved in taking his life, how dare you sit there and look forward to your birthday? “He will never get to see another birthday or Christmas again. He will never get married, never have children, never have a chance to see his brothers and sisters grow up. She branded the five “cowards running around with knives” and added: Nobody has the right to take somebody else’s life. That night I have been told my son was screaming, begging you to stop, and you just carried on.  “He would not hurt anyone. He was not in a gang. He would not start a fight. I know my baby was petrified. He never stood a chance. Sentencing Judge Adele Williams said: This case illustrates the problems which occur when young men such as you carry knives and use knives. “You all had a fascination with knives. I have no doubt you all thought it was glamorous and macho to carry a knife. “You, Ephrain Akinwunmi-Streets, said in interview you all sometimes wore masks to scare people. You all though it would make people look up to you and to fear you. “You were all running out of control at this time. You believed the law did not apply to you. During the trial, you all sought to blame each other. “This was a revenge attack upon another group. “It was a senseless, ruthless and calculated killing, for which not one of you has at any stage shown any sign of remorse.” Maibvisira, of Gillingham, Akinwunmi-Streets, from Sittingbourne, Ralph, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Daley, 18, of Gillingham, and Dania, from Croydon, south London, all denied murder and violent disorder but were found guilty last week.

Jen Phanomrat, of the YouTube channel Just Eat Life, shared the happy news with her 81,000 subscribers when her boyfriend of nine years Leo Samanamud finally proposed. After getting engaged, Jen posted a photo of her and Leo on her Instagram account, writing: Nine years later, I said YES to my best friend! While some fans were quick to congratulate the happy couple, Jen said she was shocked by the number of negative comments criticising the size and style of Jen\u0027s ring.  It just seems like he went into the store like show me the smallest ring ever made,\u0027 one wrote. I understand simplicity, but this is beyond my understanding why anyone would buy something that small. Another mocked Jen by asking: Where\u0027s the ring? while another added: So are we all just going to pretend like that ring isn\u0027t microscopically small? Another even went as far as to suggest that Leo hadn\u0027t bothered to find out her ring size and suggested the ring wasn\u0027t big enough for Jen\u0027s finger. It must suck to wait nine years for a ring that looks like that, one wrote.  However Jen refused to let the nasty comments dampen her engagement joy and told Yahoo News the ring was exactly what she would have chosen for herself. He knew exactly what type of ring I\u0027d love, she said. A delicate, hammered gold ring with a tiny pearl. I don\u0027t usually wear any jewellery, but when I do, it\u0027s simple and minimal.

She explained that she had deleted many of the hateful comments but has since seen a meme using their photo which was shared on Instagram with the caption: Ladies, would you accept the ring and say yes? However the couple also received lots of positive comments congratulating them on their engagement.  Many were keen to point out how happy they looked and that it is love what matters - not the size or value of the ring.

However she believes her late pooch wasn’t far away, as she saw his ‘ghost’ on the living room curtains one evening.

Elizabeth Parker, 30, tipped the scales at 139kg after turning to food for comfort as she used it to manage her emotions. She\u0027d be out of breath after walking 10 steps and had disrupted sleep at her heaviest, a size 24.  The social worker also became more reclusive and isolated after she gave birth to her son.  She said the challenges with first-time parenthood made her suffer with depression, anxiety and social anxiety and so she turned to food to cope. But at the age of 28, sick of being consumed by food, she became determined to finally solve her weight problems. Amazingly, her weight has dropped to 65kg after having a weight loss procedure and making changes to her lifestyle and she now wears a size 10 or 12.   Speaking to the Daily Mail , Elizabeth said: I would eat large amounts and wouldn\u0027t stop until I felt physically ill, it was a continuous cycle of self-loathing and self-destruction.  I would binge eat to manage emotional distress then I would feel terrible about myself it was a continuous cycle that caused me a great deal of mental anguish. I avoided mirrors because it was distressing looking at myself and I felt so much guilt and shame.  The mum, who has struggled with her weight for most of her life, also said she felt undeserving of love and happiness. But she reached the stage where she just wanted something different for herself, and to live a healthy life. Elizabeth tried several diets before turning to bariatric surgery, weight loss surgery, to shed the pounds.

However, a few guys like Alan Gordon would travel through from Edinburgh.“It may be difficult, now, to get experienced players to relocate with the commitments they have like young kids and houses – that could cause an issue for Csaba.“That’s before you even get to the problem of fighting other teams financially.”Jackie left the club to re-join the Buddies for a successful period in their history from 1976-1983 before moving into various administration roles at the club.Of the move back, Jackie added: “Initially it worked at United but then it became a bit difficult.“The manager understood that and he was really good about it before I moved to St Mirren.“I always lived locally and followed the team so it felt right to move back at that time.“It’s funny how you get an association with a club and have an affinity with it.“I enjoyed my time at Tannadice as much as I did my spell at St Mirren.“Obviously, I finished my career at St Mirren and became a bit of a club legend but I still miss the Dundee days. I’m coming up in November for a reunion with the 1973/74 Scottish Cup Final team so it will be nice to catch up with everyone.”Of his former sides’ recent history, Jackie has watched United flounder from afar as St Mirren won promotion to the Premiership last season under the now-Sunderland boss Jack Ross.“Dundee United is a great club and I hope it can be restored in the top league because the fans deserve it.“St Mirren were going good. It was nice to see them get back up to the top flight.“Jack did really well and getting an offer like that (to boss Sunderland) nobody could begrudge him taking it.“Hopefully, Alan Stubbs continues the work and does well next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united set to win race for defender frans","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are expected to make their sixth signing of the summer in the shape of centre-back Frederic Frans.The former Partick Thistle defender has been the subject of a three-way bid between the Tangerines, the Jags and Ross County.However, United are expected to win that race.The 29-year-old left Firhill in 2016 to return to his native Belgium as captain of his former youth team Lierse SK.This summer he’s a free agent, however, after the Belgian club went bankrupt.And he is expected to arrive at Tannadice over the coming days to try to help the Tangerines to promotion back to the Premiership next season.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/1187299-e1525270567183-940x564.jpg ","title":"new dundee united coach burger turned down offers in germany for tannadice","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United boss Csaba Laszlo has appointed his long-time assistant Werner Burger as first-team coach at Tannadice.The Tele exclusively revealed at the start of May Burger would be joining the Tangerines backroom staff and the club confirmed it yesterday.Burger worked under Csaba for three years at Hearts between 2008 and 2011 as well as at MTK Budapest and Slovak side DAC Dunajska Streda.Laurie Ellis will continue in his role of assistant manager.The 60-year-old German said: “I am delighted to join Dundee United.“Csaba and I have very similar ideas about football and I think you need that as a base to develop a team that is capable of meeting your targets.”Meanwhile, Csaba added that Burger had turned down opportunities in Germany to make the switch to Scotland once more.The United gaffer said: “I am very pleased Werner has turned down other options in Germany to link up with me here.“I feel that, together with Laurie, Craig and Scott, we now have a very strong backroom team to foster the right mentality and team spirit in the squad.”Burger made regular appearances at Dundee United matches last season as well as watching training sessions before finally being appointed as first-team coach.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"spfl fixtures dundee united kick off 2018 19 at tannadice","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United will kick off their third attempt at getting back to Scotland\u0026#8217s top-flight at home against Dunfermline.Fixtures released today by the SPFL reveal that Csaba Laszlo\u0026#8217s men will take on The Pars at Tannadice on August 4.The Tangerines are then on the long road to face Queen of the South on August 11, before facing relegated Partick Thistle on August 25 \u0026#8211 after the league break for the BetFred Cup.Should United be there or abouts near the end of the season they face a tough final run-in.Games against Ross County (away), Ayr (home), Inverness (away) and Falkik (home) all lie ahead before a final day trip to take on Morton \u0026#8211 managed by former United man Ray McKinnon.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/SOCCER-Champions-League-232236.jpg-287x180.jpg ","title":"the teles world cup preview group as local links","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYet again Scotland won’t be there but the big kick-off is today and all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.The action starts at 4pm when the hosts take on Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.The Tele’s build-up starts as, group by group, we give you the lowdown on the 32 teams that’ll be doing battle.Trying not to leave you feeling too left out by the Tartan Army’s absence, we’ll also provide a local link, tenuous or otherwise, to each participating nation.\u0026nbspGROUP ARussiaThey are attempting to become the seventh host nation to lift the trophy but, if they do, it would be one of the biggest shocks in the game’s history.Head coach Stanislav Cherchesov’s team simply lack the necessary quality and while they should safely negotiate their group, are unlikely to go much further in the business end of the competition.Star players: Denis Cheryshev, Aleksandr Golovin.Local Link: Dundee United’s last competitive European game was a 5-0 defeat to Dynamo Moscow on the outskirts of the Russian capital back in August 2012.It’s the only time either United or Dundee have faced up to Russian opposition in Europe.Saudi ArabiaIf this was the old Fifa you might suspect Saudi Arabia being in Russia’s group was not by chance. Their presence should help the hosts get through to the next stage.The Saudis, while a decent side, will do well to avoid defeat in all three of their games.Star player: Salem Al-Dawsari.Local link: Back in 1989, Saudi Arabia were based at Dens Park for the group stage of the U/15 World Cup. They went on to win the tournament by beating Scotland in the final at Hampden – amid, it should be said, accusations of them fielding over-age players.EgyptThey could be the surprise packages of Group A, though with Liverpool’s Mo Salah battling for fitness after dislocating a shoulder in the Champions League Final, goals could be a problem.With the likes of Mohamed Elneny of Arsenal and Aston Villa’s Ahmed Elmohamady in their line-up, they are not quite a one-man team.Star player: Mo Salah.Local link: United legend Maurice Malpas made remarkable comeback from a serious knee injury to face the Egyptians in a 3-1 Pittodrie defeat for Scotland as they warmed up for the 1990 World Cup.And Dundee goalie Elliott Parish played for England in an U/20s World Cup in Egypt back in 2009.UruguayTwice winners of the World Cup, a third triumph is highly unlikely, but the Uruguayans are a side most of the big guns would like to avoid.With Barcelona striker Luis Suarez in their ranks they will always carry a big goal threat, though having finished the last two World Cups in disgrace, just getting through these finals without mishap might be his biggest achievement.Star player: Luis Suarez.Local link: Dundee United have signed three Uruguayans, though between them Juan Ferreri, Carlos Marcora and Edison Machin managed just two appearances.One-time national team skipper Machin did look quality but passport problems led to his stay being a brief one.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/dundee2-257x180.jpg ","title":"the teles world cup preview group bs local links","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYet again Scotland aren\u0026#8217t there but all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia after yesterday\u0026#8217s big kick-off.The action got under way in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium with a bang as the hosts smashed Saudi Arabia 5-0.Today sees Egypt take on Uruguay in Group A as well as Group B kicking off.Now, the Tele takes it\u0026#8217s own special preview of Group B with Morocco, Iran battling it out with giants Portugal and Spain.Trying not to leave you feeling too left out by the Tartan Army’s absence, we’ll also provide a local link, tenuous or otherwise, to each participating nation.\u0026nbspGroup BMoroccoThe Moroccans will want to put up a good showing in Russia after the disappointment of missing out in their bid to host the 2026 World Cup.It’s their first appearance in the finals since France 98 – more of that below – and they boast enough players playing at a decent level in the European leagues to be able to give a good account of themselves.Star player: Medhi Benatia.Local link: Although he was born in St Tropez in the south of France, Dundee striker Faissal El Bakhtaoui also qualifies for Morocco through family links.More painfully, Dundonian and former Dundee United favourite Christian Dailly was part of the side that lost 3-0 to Morocco in 1998 – Scotland’s last game in a finals.\u0026nbspIranThey’ll be regarded by many as among the minnows of these finals but Iran actually head for Russia boasting a Fifa ranking of 36.That’s just two behind Scotland.Star player: Ashkan Dejagah.Local link: Danny McLennan.If the name on its own doesn’t bring it all flooding back, we can reveal the man who briefly joined Dundee from East Fife in 1957 and played in four League Cup ties before disappearing again, went on to manage Iran for a year between 1973 and 1974. How\u0026#8217s that for tenuous?Of course, the Iranians also broke Scotland hearts with a 1-1 draw in Argentina during our  disastrous finals appearance way back in 1978.\u0026nbspPortugalThe European champions have to stand a reasonable chance of winning the competition –  almost any side that boasts Cristiano Ronaldo in their ranks can never be dismissed too lightly.If they do go all the way, it’s to be hoped they deliver a more attractive brand of football than the often bland stuff they produced en route to that Euro title two years ago.Star player: Cristiano Ronaldo.Local link: Portuguese striker Joaquim Ferraz was a big-money signing from Belenenses by Paul Sturrock during his time in charge of Dundee United, though a derby winner apart, made little impact.Ex-Tangerines superkid Ryan Gauld is now at Sporting Lisbon, having been in Portugal for four years and has spent time on loan at Vitoria de Setubal and Aves.Last but not least, Dundee’s league championship-winning side thrashed Sporting on their way to the European Cup semi-finals in 1963.\u0026nbspSpainThe 2012 winners are fancied by many to repeat that success this time round \u0026#8211 though, the sacking of manager Julen Lopetegui two days before their opening clash with Portugal won\u0026#8217t have made for a smooth start to the tournament.Spain, Real Madrid and Bolton legend Fernando Hierro is in the hotseat now and is straight into action tonight at 7pm.Andres Iniesta will be making his last appearance in the finals and remains a player to be reckoned with. Younger stars like Isco of Real Madrid could also make their mark.Star player: David Silva.Local link: Although they doesn’t like to be referred to as a Spaniard, Basque defenders Julen Etxabeguren and Jon Aurtenetxe – who left Dundee at the end of the season – are technically Spanish.Other ex-Dens Spaniards, who don’t mind being called so, include fans’ favourites in wing-back Javier Artero and striker Nacho Novo.Dundee United’s big Spanish link is, of course, beating Barcelona home and away in European competition, not once but twice.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":" Human snake  reveals he sheds his skin every TWO DAYS","story":"                          A hospital worker has told how his painful psoriasis has turned him into a \"human snake\" after the condition means he sheds his skin every TWO DAYS."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7923466.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Nursery first in Scotland to offer flexi-schooling scheme","story":"                          PARENTS of children starting school this year will be given the option of combining nursery and primary lessons, under the first scheme of its kind in Scotland."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7567520.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Low Emission Zone to cover all vehicles in Glasgow","story":"                          A LOW emissions zone in Glasgow city centre will be extended to all vehicles by December 2022."},{"url":null,"title":"Woman woke from operation to find she d been given BREAST implants- without her consent","story":"                          A woman has sued a hospital trust after she woke from an operation to discover she had been given breast implants -

A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from

Funds raised in memory of local schoolboy Hamish Hey (8) will contribute to the process of shaping the links.The Team Hamish charity, established in memory of the young cancer victim, has raised more than \u0026pound50,000. Relatives want residents to share their thoughts at the charity\u0027 own consultation event next Wednesday (7.30-9pm) in the town\u0027 community and arts centre.It is working with the council and the Nairn Improvement Community Enterprise to create a disabled-friendly links recreation area.The council wants to promote use of the links to \"build on the special nature of the area and add to the historic value of the links as a visitor destination\".Consultation already carried out showed strong support for replacing the paddling pool with \"an alternative form of water play\". People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Friday 15 Jun 2018 2:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114012.jpg","title":"The street has no name six years on","story":"\u0026nbspTHE hunt is on for a name for an Inverness street \u0026ndash after a six-year wait.The road that runs through Milton of Leys has never been named.Highland Council said it was agreed as far back as 2012 that naming the street \"would not be beneficial as it was not providing access to a particular address\".But the council has changed tack after a complaint from the ward\u0027\u0026nbspNon-Aligned Highland councillor Ken Gowans.He said residents were experiencing difficulties directing delivery drivers and added: \"If you had a bad accident on that road how would you identify your position? \"That road is a main thoroughfare that goes right the way down Milton of Leys.

football regularly because at one point there was the possibility he would never do it again.The midfielder has penned a new contract with Peterhead to keep him at Balmoor for next season.After joining the Blue Toon last summer, Leitch enjoyed a fine campaign with the Buchan side.The 22-year-old made 42 appearances and scored six goals.Leitch admits he appreciates playing regularly, after having to battle back from a severe knee injury earlier in his career.In October 2014 he ruptured his posterior cruciate ligament in an Under-20s game while with Motherwell.Leitch returned at the end of that season and after leaving the Steelmen in 2016, he has featured regularly for Airdrieonians and now Peterhead.He said: “I definitely appreciate being able to play regular.“It’s something I’ve enjoyed and I enjoyed it before, at Airdrieonians.“Having two full seasons under my belt has been great. I’ve had a couple of niggles in that time but you always get them during a season – but, touch wood, I haven’t had anything serious since the knee.“I think it’s the confidence of playing every week and getting games that gives you belief that you are fine and that everything is all right.“It (the injury) is always in the back of your mind when you first come back, but you need to work on that over time.“You need to concentrate on what you’re doing on the park and concentrate on doing the good things on the pitch and not worrying about that.“If you start worrying about that mentally then something will eventually happen. You need to stay positive and keep playing football.”For Leitch it was an easy decision to stay with Peterhead and he feels he has rediscovered the form he showed as a promising youngster at Fir Park.He added: “I’ve really enjoyed my time up at Peterhead. I loved playing last season.“We were a bit disappointed with the way things ended.“We won nine of the last 10 games, finished with 76 points, but didn’t win the league or go up through the play-offs.“But I’m looking forward to trying to right a few wrongs from last year and make sure we win the league next season.“I feel I improved at Peterhead. I thought I got stronger as the season went on.“I felt I finished the season really strongly and I felt I was starting to get back to the player I was at 17 or 18 at Motherwell, when people were talking about me a lot.“It was good to have that confidence and play without any fear.

It’s great to be partnering up with RGU for the festival.Festival director Sally Reaper added: “We have an even bigger and better festival lined up for this year and are excited to be working with a host of local, national and international artists to really bring the city to life over the course of four days in June.” One particular piece which has grabbed the attention of a number of people is James Rigler’s A House in the Woods in the centre of Marischal College’s quadrangle.The pink house has been inspired by elements of the college’s architecture.James said: “There are a few different interpretations of the house – it could be a witch’s house, or a home on the prairie as well as having these Gothic elements.“It’s very bright and cheery but it’s also a little bit sinister – sort of like a mashup of the Wizard of Oz and Psycho.“There’s a real juxtaposition in the piece.”Members of the public will also get a sweet treat from the “witch’s house”, with gingerbread ice cream being handed at noon each day to visitors.Libby Curtis, head of RGU’s Gray’s School of Art, added: “We’re thrilled to be celebrating the Year of Young People by joining forces with Look Again and reflecting its theme of Serious Play to spotlight great visual art and design across the city.“As a city of culture and invention, a city with a unique and distinctive identity, we are growing again through a renewed sense of purpose backed by the new Cultural Aberdeen strategy, which both Gray’s and Look Again have played a pivotal part in forming.”Other works on display during the festival include Positive Geographies – an exhibition of new work by 2017 graduates from Gray’s.There will also be performances by Emily Speed tomorrow.This will feature 13 dancers all based in the north-east, dressed as buildings and performing at the Castlegate, Marischal Quad and Broad Street.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cadets flag up lochgilpheads big day","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/06/18, 1:03 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAfter weeks of brilliant sunshine, the weather took a turn for the damp just in time for the flag raising ceremony.This annual midweek event marks the beginning of Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations, and cadets from D (Argyll) Company ignored the rain to perform the flag raising with their usual efficiency.\u0026nbspThe flag was saluted as it was raised accompanied by tunes from piper John Hunt, before Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day chairman Geordie Rhodick inspected the assembled cadets and thanked them for their attendance.Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day will take place on Saturday June 16, starting at midday with a march down Argyll Street from the Drill Hall, followed by a parade on the front green and an afternoon of fun activities for all the family.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"council perform u turn over","story":"NewsCouncil perform U-turn over car park feesThe astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:41, 13 JUN 2018NewsSouth Beach car park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParking charges WON’T be introduced at two Troon car parks, we can reveal. The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it. She said: “The veil is 25 years old which was worn by my aunt on her wedding day.” The groom and best men wore Grey Spirit kilts from Slaters, Ayr. The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother). The newly married Mr and Mrs jetted off for a fortnight in the sun after the big day.  The couple said: “We flew to St Lucia for 2 weeks and stayed at The Royalton. “It was amazing - so relaxed, exactly what we needed after the wedding.” Adore Weddings captured the couple’s big day, with both photography and videography, leaving them with lovely memories to look back on. Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.  Mhari said: “The cake was made by my aunt. “It was baked in Norwich then driven all the way to Scotland and built. “All the flowers are made of icing to match the flowers in my bouquet.” Linzi of Linzi Smith Hair at Distinction styled the hair for the day while Elaine Sawyer of Lookz Mobile Makeup Artist created the makeup looks. The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who travelled the distance to make our special day - some all the way from Texas. “Also a massive thank you to Ryan and Stacey of The Waterside - our day ran perfectly all thanks to them.” For more photos of this week\u0027s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Lowood Bridge closure  SBC release update","story":"GOOD news for motorists - council bosses have confirmed that works to Lowood Bridge are set to be complete in time for Melrose Festival Week.\nThe project is in its final stages and remains on schedule to be completed by Monday, June 18, the day of the Melrosian Rideout.\nSo far, the temporary scaffolding has been removed, which means works on the bridge deck area can start.\nRepairs to the bridge\u0027s stonework are now complete, as well as resurfacing of the Waverley Road/Lowood Road junction.

shouldn’t read this. It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

For services to the Scottish seafood industry.\u0026#8217Mr MacMillan, from Carradale, East Kintyre, has already been invited to the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party on Wednesday July 4.During more than half a century in the industry, Mr MacMillan, 72, has moved from working on a fishing boat, ring netting herring, to fine tuning a computer-controlled smoker to create smoked products for worldwide export.Mr MacMillan, has six employees, one of whom said: \u0026#8216Archie was awarded an MBE for being the best boss.\u0026#8217He took control of the artisan business in 1988 and has incrementally improved it ever since, eventually buying a £60,000 computer controlled smoker which it took him three months to fine tune.Mr MacMillan\u0026#8217s life in the seafood business started at the sharp end. Aged 15,  in 1961 he went to sea in the Amy Harris with an uncle.Mr MacMillan, who eats fish most days, said: \u0026#8216Sometimes in the mid-1960s we were earning between £9 and £11 a week which was a good wage.\u0026#8216It was spring 1962 when we started fishing for scallops and the price of a dozen sold to London was 12/6.\u0026#8217It was a brother of his mother, Mary MacMillan, née Paterson, Archie Paterson, who taught him all he knew, in a decade aboard Harvest Queen.By 1972 some Clyde boats were gearing up for pair trawling, where a net is trawled between two boats.Mr MacMillan, helped with a £12,000 loan from the Highlands and Islands Development Board, bought his own boat, Remembrance, from Finlay Cunningham.For pair trawling Mr MacMillan worked with a partner James Rennie on Monarch and in the 1980s they began exporting scallops to markets, including Belgium, Barcelona and Johannesburg.At the same time as fishing from a boat Mr MacMillan was learning about smoking products.\u0026#8216I used to come to the smokehouse when the weather was too bad to go out on the boat,\u0026#8217 said Mr MacMillan, \u0026#8216That is how I learned to smoke fish \u0026#8211 such as kippers.\u0026#8216It was different days there were not environmental health officers coming chapping at the door,\u0026#8217 added the man who has a prized certificate from SALSA \u0026#8211 Safe and Local Supplier Approval for hot and cold smoking of salmon. Cold smoking of haddock, herring, scallops, mussels and cheese.MacMillan Food\u0026#8217s environmental efforts have also been recognised by the Carbon Trust.That certificate states: \u0026#8216Cutting carbon emissions.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICTURES  Aberlady Gala","story":"              There was great fun at Aberlady Gala today - as these pictures show!

This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.

On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.  She added: \u0026ldquoI would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs McGillivray for her service and leadership of King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School and more recently Haddington Infant School.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7440191.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Plans for 1 500 homes and new school on edge of Musselburgh","story":"              A PLANNING application has been lodged for 1,500 new houses, a primary school and employment land at Craighall, by Musselburgh.  Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7868119.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"12 new rules the council is making over selfish parking in Musselburgh","story":"              A RAFT of traffic restrictions are to be introduced in Musselburgh to control inconsiderate parking.

President Donald Trump has vowed to clamp down on what he calls China\u0026rsquos unfair trade practices.  China has said that it will retaliate with 50 billion dollars in tariffs in response, rattling financial markets.  It comes in the aftermath of Mr Trump\u0026rsquos nuclear summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his push for China to maintain economic pressure on the North.  Mr Trump has already slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan, drawing a rebuke from US allies.  In a statement, the president said: \u0026ldquoThe United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices.  The Office of the US Trade Representative said the tariffs will start to be collected on July 6.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that China\u0026rsquos response would be immediate and that Beijing would \u0026ldquotake necessary measures to defend our legitimate rights and interests.  Beijing earlier drew up a list of 50 billion dollars in US products that would face retaliatory tariffs, including beef and soybeans, a shot at Mr Trump\u0026rsquos supporters in rural America.  Mr Trump\u0026rsquos decision on the Chinese tariffs comes in the aftermath of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  The president has co-ordinated closely with China on efforts to get Pyongyang to eliminate its nuclear arsenal.  But he signalled that whatever the implications, \u0026ldquoI have to do what I have to do to address the trade imbalance.  Administration officials have signalled support for imposing the tariffs in a dispute over allegations that Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology, according to officials briefed on the plans.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2018  Wall Street has viewed the escalating trade tensions with wariness, fearful they could strangle US economic growth and undermine the benefits of the tax cuts Mr Trump signed into law last year.  \u0026ldquoIf you end up with a tariff battle, you will end up with price inflation, and you could end up with consumer debt. Those are all historic ingredients for an economic slowdown, Gary Cohn, Mr Trump\u0026rsquos former top economic adviser, said at an event sponsored by The Washington Post.  The Chinese have threatened to counterpunch.  For example, officials have said they would drop agreements reached last month to buy more US soybeans, natural gas and other products.  The US and China have been holding negotiations over the trade dispute.  The United States has criticised China for the aggressive tactics it uses to develop advanced technologies, including robots and electric cars, under its Made in China 2025 programme.  The US tariffs are designed specifically to punish China for forcing American companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

The decline of traditional nine-to-five jobs and the rise of flexible working and 24-hour shift patterns has led to calls for businesses to provide more services outside of the \u0027normal\u0027 working day.\u0026nbsp  The changing way people spent their leisure time was reflected in a study by Barclays which found that they want services to be available round-the-clock.  Calls were made for museums to stay open late into the evening and for cinemas to show films into the early hours of the morning.  People also want to see takeaway hours extended through the night so they can pick up a meal until 5am.  But while habits are changing, the report found that only a quarter of UK hospitality and leisure businesses recognise this growing demand, and said that opening hours are not keeping up with changes to modern working lives.    Jamie Grant, Head of Corporate Banking for Barclays in Scotland, believes that businesses were losing out by not responding to the dawning of 24-hour culture.  He said: \u0026ldquoAdapting to the changing consumer demand presents a substantial opportunity for Scottish businesses.\u0026nbsp  \"Our research has shown that leisure operators across the country could access a staggering \u0026pound6.75bn per annum by accommodating their customers\u0026rsquo evolving needs which have been brought on by changing working patterns.\u0026nbsp  \"While that may be a challenge for some providers, understanding the value of the opportunity makes the prize more tangible.\"\u0026nbsp  The new Barclays Corporate Banking Hospitality and Leisure report, Open All Hours? found that only a quarter of Scots now work traditional 9-5 hours, with nearly a one-in-five saying they need different opening hours.\u0026nbsp  More than one in ten Scots now expect hospitality services to be available 24-hours, and may be disappointed if they aren\u0027t.\u0026nbsp  The study concluded that by responding to this demand, Scotland\u0026rsquos restaurants could benefit by \u0026pound126m each year, takeaways by \u0026pound144m, and pubs, bars and clubs could benefit the most by accessing a market worth almost \u0026pound100 million each.  One sector identified to be rising to the challenge of changing work patterns the country\u0027s gyms, with some allowing PIN-controlled access systems, smart lighting, temperature controls and extensive video monitoring to overcome the staffing issues that deter some businesses from after-hours opening.\u0026nbsp    Mr Grant added: \u0026ldquoThe current leisure environment does present a number of challenges for the sector\u0026rsquos businesses the labour supply is challenged by Brexit, rent increases and food inflation are all set within the context of an incredibly competitive market which is already heavily discounting. \u0026nbsp  \"However, those that don\u0026rsquot adapt to this type of newly developing consumer demand risk being left behind and in this ever-competitive environment, businesses need to weigh up the value of the long-term opportunity over the cost of the short-term investment.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Parents and teachers blamed for  obsession  with university education","story":"              PARENTS and teachers pressurise pupils to go to university without knowing whether it is the best option for them, a leading industrialist has claimed.  Sir Ian Wood, the former Wood Group chief executive and philanthropist, said the pervasive culture that higher education was \"the be all and end all\" was damaging to the large proportion of pupils who were not academically minded.  And he called for a greater focus on the importance of vocational qualifications - as well as a campaign to highlight successful and lucrative careers outside the traditional professions.  Sir Ian was giving evidence to the Scottish Parliament\u0027s education committee, which is looking at the options available to pupils when they leave school.  He said: \"There is a real cultural thing about university being the be all and end all and therefore anything that is not university frankly tends to get secondary consideration. Parents are at fault, teachers are at fault, some schools are at fault.  \"We are trying to change a long embedded view that somehow the really worthwhile thing in life is to go to university and so many parents have got that as the aspiration for the youngster.  \"Parents are the root of the problem, but teachers are the next stage up because a lot of teachers believe that their success is based on how many Highers their children get.\"  Sir Ian told the committee apprenticeships and trades occupations should be made more respectable and highlighted the fact many pupils who had a technical education earned higher salaries than those who went to university.  He added: \"Because of the culture issue a lot of people go to university because their parents want them to go to university ... but they come out and they are still not sure what they want to do and the qualification hasn\u0027t really helped them an awful lot.\"  Joanna Murphy, chairwoman of the National Parent Forum of Scotland, said pupils could be \"negatively influenced\" by parents, but this was often due to a lack of understanding of the alternative opportunities.  She said: \"Although career opportunities are being highlighted more frequently in schools, particularly the promotion of apprenticeships, this tends to be focused in fifth and sixth year which is far too late for parents.\"  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect Scotland, said many parents got the message \"loud and clear\" from schools that university was the desirable next step.  She said: \"Since it is well recognised that most parents receive their information about education from their child\u0026rsquos school we can\u0026rsquot be surprised at the result.  \"Parents tell us that they feel they receive little information about diverse routes both in and after school, and they often feel frustrated that their child is being ignored in a system which focusses on higher education if their child is not academically minded.  \"Some parents have a clear vision of what they want for their child based on their experience and often family tradition and it is up to schools to help families and young people see the value of wider approaches.\"  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, said it was not teachers, but the Scottish Government and schools quango Education Scotland who \"obsessed\" about the number of Higher passes. And he also argued business had \"raised the stakes\" by making more jobs degree level entry only.  He said: \"I think teachers will bridle at his dismissal of their efforts to encourage vocational pathways. We have been arguing constantly that senior school has been overly focused on qualifications for the past four years.\"  A spokesman for Universities Scotland said: \"We have been absolutely clear that we need to a conversation about getting parents and schools to recognise that the best outcome for young people is the outcome that allows the young person to fulfil their potential.  \"We are also clear that for many people university is the right option for them later in life and we need diverse routes to success for diverse individuals.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow  is clogged with roads  traffic and pollution ","story":"              It is universally known as the Dear Green Place due to the number of parks and open spaces where the residents could enjoy some leisure time.  But a new report has revealed that Glasgow has more space given up to roads than any other major UK city and is suffering amongst the worst congestion as a result.  The report claims the city is in danger  of being strangled by too many roads clogged with slow-moving vehicles, choked by high levels of pollution and bereft of  city-centre residents.  As a result, it warns Glasgow is in danger of sliding behind rival cities in its ability to compete for jobs, investment and visitors.  Early findings from the Glasgow Connectivity Commission says there is a need to drastically \u0026ldquorewire the city\u0026rsquos transport system which sees city-centre buses crawl at an average of just 4.5mph and fails to meet the needs of destinations such as Glasgow Airport and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.  The report, which has been looking at how to support economic growth by enabling more people to live, work and visit the city, claims Glasgow is already straggling behind its rivals with too many commuters travelling from the suburbs adding to congestion and pollution, and too few people living in the city\u0026rsquos centre.  It warns other cities which have boosted the number of inner city residents had gone on to see economic investment and jobs increase. A key problem, according to the report, is Glasgow\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquogrid system layout which it says hands significantly more space over to roads than other UK cities, despite it having one of the lowest car ownership levels.  Some 25 per cent of land in the city centre is covered by roads, while pavements take up just eight per cent.  In Edinburgh, however, there is a more equal balance, with roads using just 12% of space, while pavements have 10%.  The commission\u0026rsquos report also points to a rise in goods vehicles \u0026ndash such as home delivery services \u0026ndash and private-hire taxis which could be adding to congestion problems.  The independent commission was established by Glasgow Council leader Susan Aitken with a remit to rethink the city centre as a business, retail and leisure destination.  It is spearheaded by former government transport adviser Professor David Begg.  He said: \u0026ldquoA generation ago Glasgow  led the way across the UK towards  what was seen as a modernised transport system built for the car.  \u0026ldquoNow, with rapidly changing demands and a trend towards low-carbon infrastructure, the priorities of people have changed quite dramatically.  \u0026ldquoThe dominance of the road is being questioned not only in social terms  with its negative impact on air quality and road safety, but also economically as its rival European cities transform their environments in favour of pedestrians, cyclists and integrated public transport.  It pointed to a dramatic decline in bus use which has seen passenger numbers slump by 40% in the past decade. In the past four years, First Bus has lost 27 million passengers \u0026ndash a markedly worse decline than any other UK city.  Despite the introduction of cycle lanes and better walkways, evidence to the commission from SPT had shown  journeys by bike had increased by 3%  in the decade to 2016, and the proportion of journeys on foot had fallen from  15% to 11%.  The findings pointed to research that showed large increases in city-centre employment in Manchester and Leeds occurring at the same time as a population boom. Many new residents were young professionals attracted by job prospects and amenities.  Ms Aitken said: \u0026ldquoDavid Begg\u0026rsquos expertise and knowledge speaks for itself. I gave him and his commissioners a very broad remit \u0026ndash linked to improving the city centre experience supporting the local economy, and ensuring all of Glasgow\u0026rsquos people can share in the prosperity it creates.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom pleased to see them really take that challenge on and it is clear the commission has already gathered some very significant and sometimes uncomfortable evidence.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to try to second-guess what their final recommendations are going to be, but I\u0026rsquom convinced they will present a healthy challenge to the city and to members of all parties on the council.  The commission will produce its final report and recommendations in November."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7922625.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Get into the summer spirit with these great Scottish gins","story":"              SCOTLAND\u0027S\u0026nbsplove of gin continues to evolve in new and interesting ways.

The still was made locally in Elgin by highly skilled craftsmen who carefully shaped copper sheets into a traditional 250l copper still making the micro-distillery one of the smallest in the region.    Gin enthusiasts will be given a rare insight into this Elgin based distillery as they open their doors with an upcoming special two day event. On Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 July, you will have the chance to join a small group for an intimate tour of the facility. During the open days you can taste their popular range of Avva Scottish Gins, along with their sister brand Berry Good Liqueurs.  Avva Scottish Gin was launched in 2016, with strong links to surrounding Elgin. The ethos behind the company is history, provenance and family, made evident through the personal details all intrinsically linked to the name, the design, the still, botanical selection, the Speyside region and the distillers\u0026rsquo family.    Jill Brown, the founder and owner of Moray Distillery, said: \u0026ldquoThe distillery is not normally open to the public, so we\u0026rsquore excited to host another open day. It\u0026rsquos a great activity for people to experience around the area, and something a little different, especially for anyone looking to have a day out and explore Elgin.  \u0026ldquoIt was important for us to create a product with links to our history and culture. Our still is called Jessie Jean- named after both my grandmothers, and Avva actually means respected grandmother. The \u0026lsquorose window\u0026rsquo design on each bottle was created to represent what it was thought the Elgin Cathedral window looked like.  \u0026ldquoThe feedback we\u0026rsquove had since the launch has been immense\u0026hellip I\u0026rsquom really proud of our gin.

As trains pass overhead on their way south from Glasgow Central station, Darran is busy distilling Illicit Gin using traditional methods. Botanicals infuse in a\u0026nbsp copper pot still over a naked flame, the process is truly small batch and each bottle is hand-filled and labelled on site.    With their first product launching in April this year Illicit Gin aims to take gin back to its roots, the way gin should be \u0026ndash with juniper firmly at the forefront. Other botanicals including liquorice, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg \u0026ndash which contribute a sweet, earthy flavour \u0026ndash along with perfumed notes from the likes of cardamom and orange and lemon peels provide citrus freshness.  The short, squat nature of the still used at Illicit Spirits helps produce spirits which are full-bodied, flavourful in character, and rich in texture. A spirit of this kind deserves to be enjoyed simply, neat over ice, or served with a premium tonic, slice of orange peel and a bruised cardamom pod.    \u0026nbspIllicit Gin is currently stocked in a small selection of independent bars and off-licences throughout Glasgow and beyond, and will be moving into UK-wide distribution later in the year.  en-gb.facebook/illicitspiritsco  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Isle of Skye Distillers  Isle of Skye Distillers\u0026rsquo story began in 2016, when brothers Alistair and Thomas Wilson combined their experience in the hospitality and construction industries and completed their vision: to build the first gin distillery on the Isle of Skye.    At Isle of Skye Distillers, provenance is everything. The distillery is proud to use locally foraged juniper berries and clear spring water from the Storr Lochs to create their small-batch spirits: Misty Isle Gin, and Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin, both infused with a true taste of Skye. Every part of the production process is carried out at the distillery in Portree, right down to hand-numbering and signing each bottle.  Alongside these locally grown juniper berries, Misty Isle Gin is distilled with a precise balance of botanicals, including coriander, grains of paradise, orris root, liquorice root, black cubebs, angelica root, lemon peel, lemon verbena, cassia bark, and another secret ingredient, which can only be found at high altitude on the Isle of Skye. Still crafted according to the original recipe first developed by Thomas and Alistair during the distillery\u0026rsquos creation, Misty Isle Gin is juniper-heavy with earthy undertones, a hint of spice, and best enjoyed with a Scottish tonic water and a twist of orange peel.  Distilled alongside Misty Isle Gin is Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin, which was created in memory of Alistair and Thomas\u0026rsquo late father, Tommy Wilson, who served in the Suez invasion. \u0026lsquoTommy\u0026rsquo is also a generic name and term of endearment for a soldier. For every bottle of Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin sold, a donation is made to local military charities.

In the work they do (and have done!), Dale and Vicky have always focused on creating the purest, best possible standard of end product. The precision of an engineer and the taste of perfection from a master baker and chef made the perfect blend for the development of this award winning gin brand.    McQueen Gin is a true craft spirit gin brand, which shares Dale and Vicky\u0026rsquos taste of adventure. They are fulfilling their dream by creating a product made using the purest and most authentic of methods and sharing it with the increasing population of gin lovers. The McQueen gins are infused with natural notes of hand-selected botanicals during distillation, with no flavour elements added after it leaves their much-loved still named \u0026lsquoLittle Maggie\u0026rsquo. This trademark distillation method means that each unique flavour is pure and perfectly balanced, allowing the adventurous gin drinker an experience that is absolutely unrivalled.    Based at their much-loved distillery in Callander, Scotland they introduced true craft spirits with flavour profiles such as smokey chilli, mocha, mint chocolate and sweet citrus, with something for every occasion and flavour profiles that true craft gin drinkers can\u0026rsquot wait to try. The strong belief in their philosophy of bringing customers a taste of adventure and discovery, married with their unique distillation method, is what makes the product so unique. Craft gin drinkers increasingly want provenance and true hand-crafted products, something McQueen ensures. When developing the product, the team spent 6 months working on over 100 iterations to develop the initial product range which was a world first at the time.  At McQueen Gin, they continue to explore new innovative methods to ensure that their pure and exciting products deliver on all levels. This includes the imminent introduction of a stylish new glass version of their award-winning ceramic bottle and the build of a new and improved distillery on their land in Callander, which has recently got underway.

Each of our spirits is characterised by our use of locally grown botanicals, including a variety of Norse Angelica brought to the islands by seafarers centuries ago. We grow these botanicals in partnership with the Orkney Agronomy Institute in Kirkwall, ensuring consistent quality throughout the harvest.  If you\u0026rsquove not already experienced our gins, please allow us to share the highlights.  Firstly, we have our acclaimed Norse inspired signature gin, Kirkjuvagr, evoking the freshness of the Orkney seas and the purity of our island environment.  For the bold, we offer a 57% ABV, Storm Strength Arkh-Angell gin, which adds new depths to the renowned flavour profile of its elder spirit.  And, finally, we have our newest release, Harpa, a light and fruity gin that takes Kirkjuvagr\u0026rsquos character in a new direction for the long days of summer.  It\u0026rsquos a range that offers something for all occasions and every season.  This summer sees Orkney Distilling move to a permanent new home on the shores of Kirkwall Bay, representing the latest chapter in our saga.                         .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default .vjs-tech { position: static !important }                       .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default { height: auto !important width: 100% !important}                       .vjs-playlist-description { display: none }                       .vjs-big-play-button { top: 0pxleft: 0pxright: 0pxbottom: 0pxmargin: auto }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist { background-color: #f7f4f1color: #000min-width: auto }                       .vjs-playlist cite { overflow: initialtext-overflow: initialwhite-space: initialfont-weight: 600font-size: 16px }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time { color: #fff }                       cite.vjs-playlist-name { text-align: left }                       .story-credits { margin-top: 20px }                       #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description { display: none }                       .vjs-playlist-thumbnail { margin-right: 10px !IMPORTANT }                        /* Style the overlay */                        /* Hide the overlay */                        .hide-countdown {                            display: none                        }                        .hide-overlay {                            display: none                        }                        /* Style the overlay */                        .vjs-overlay,                        .vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top {                            position: absolute                            top: 0px                            left: 0px                        }                        .vjs-overlay p {                            width: 100px                            background-color: #000000                            color: #fff                            padding: 10px                            margin: 0                            margin-bottom: 0                            border-radius: 0px                            text-align: left                        }                                               width=\"100%\"                            data-account=\"64298557001\"                            data-player=\"rkgvgWjWCG\"                            data-embed=\"default\"                            data-video-id=\"5797498382001\"                            class=\"video-js\"                            playsinline                            data-random-id=\"217889176\"                            controls  We\u0026rsquove approached the creation of our new distillery and visitor centre with the same attention to detail that we apply to our gin production.

As our guest you can join us for a guided tour to discover the secrets behind our handcrafted gins, before relaxing and sampling our range in the tasting room overlooking beautiful Kirkwall Bay. Or, you can simply enjoy a cocktail or coffee in our distillery gin bar.

One of the few craft distilleries to be awarded brown sign status, it has been publicly recognised as a star-rated destination on the Scottish tourist map.  The stables-turned-distillery \u0026ndash which was voted Most Promising New Business at the Perthshire Chamber of Commerce Star Awards \u0026ndash is where Persie gin is hand-crafted in small batches. There are three richly aromatic expressions: Zesty Citrus Herby and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty Old Tom.    The three expressions were developed by the man behind Scotland\u0026rsquos first touring gin enterprise. Founded in 2013, Gin Club Scotland was launched with the sole purpose of hearing the voice of the customer and using these insights to make a home-grown Scottish gin that hit the spot. It worked like a charm: in under a year, Simon Fairclough had visited every Scottish region and heard from over 2,000 gin-lovers about what appealed to their taste buds, pocket and sense of style. He harvested this feedback and found out two things. Firstly, for cracking gin, you need more than a nice taste: you need aroma. With over 75% of flavour down to smell, the perfect interplay of aroma and taste is the single biggest influence among Scots for liking each gin. And, secondly, three profiles proved most popular at tastings by a wide margin \u0026ndash fruity, savoury and sweet.    The result is that Persie Gin taps right into that \u0026ndash with a family of three distinct styles of aromatic gin. Each gin is made with carefully chosen botanicals to evoke an emotive and comforting scent: Zesty Citrus is sharply fruity, chock-full of limes and oranges Herby \u0026amp Aromatic is dry and savoury, with fragrant rosemary and basil and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty is full-bodied and creamy,\u0026nbspwith fresh\u0026nbspvanilla pods, almonds and a hint of root ginger.  All three gins scooped awards in the first year of trading. Zesty Citrus was voted Best Gin in Scotland Under \u0026pound35 by Scottish Field magazine Herby \u0026amp Aromatic was awarded a Silver Outstanding for Gin \u0026amp Tonic by the International Wine \u0026amp Spirits Competition and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty Old Tom was awarded a Silver Medal in the Speciality Gin category at the Scottish Gin Awards.  The distillery is open to the public for drop-ins, tours and tastings.  www.persiedistillery  snifter@persiedistillery  @persiegin  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Porter\u0027s Gin  Founders Ben, Josh and Alex turned the basement of their award winning Aberdeen cocktail bar, Orchid, into a micro-distillery. They focus on modern gin recipes that pay respect to tradition.\u0026nbsp      The result is a modern classic gin with a punchy juniper and a unique citrus flavour profile. The fresh, light and clean flavour from the cold-distilled botanicals make this a perfect gin for long refreshing summer drinks.

The expansive ocean surrounding the beautiful Isle of Barra has inspired the island-born couple\u0026rsquos adventure into the world of distilling.    With many goals set for the future of the Isle of Barra Distillers, it is the deep sense of duty that drives the team on. With a firm belief of giving something back to the community and at the same time building something that will one day outlive anyone that walks through the doors.  Michael feels that \u0026ldquoabove everything else that we can achieve from this journey, it is the thought of both giving something back to this beautiful island and also putting the Isle of Barra on the \u0026lsquogin map\u0026rsquo that drives us forward. We feel we owe it to the island and its people - we have the opportunity to do something great and something great is what we are going to do.    The key botanical in Barra gin is sourced naturally from the crystal clear, pure shallows that surround the remotre isle of Barra.  Every piece of edible carrageen seaweed is meticulously selected and handpicked by us on Barra\u0027s beautiful beaches to provide the distinctive flavour of our unique gin.  The carrageen, also known by its scientific name Chondrus Crispus, is a species of red algae native to the cool Atlantic waters skirting Europe\u0026rsquos rocky coastlines, including our beautiful Isle of Barra. Like many of the other seaweed varieties found on the Scottish coast, carrageen is harvested after the spring tides, when the water is furthest from the shore.  It\u0026rsquos this passion and belief that must surely make the story of the Isle of Barra Distillers one to remember.  www.isleofbarradistillers\u0026nbsp  www.facebook/barradistillers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Teasmith Gin  The Teasmith Gin creators Nick and Emma Smalley have created something truly special - the first Scottish Gin distilled with hand-picked tea. \u0026nbspWhy? Because Scotland has many historical links with the tea trade with several stemming from Aberdeenshire which is where the Founders are based. \u0026nbsp    When they discovered the story of James Taylor \u0026ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.\u0026nbsp It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled \u0026ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches 150 years ago on the island. \u0026nbsp  When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. \u0026nbspThese flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness\u0026nbsp  Finalists in three categories at the 2017 Scottish Gin Awards and racking up 5 awards for brand design already, this gin doesn\u0026rsquot disappoint. A truly smooth gin packaged in a beautifully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes \u0026ndash it ticks all the boxes.    Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing G\u0026ampT. \u0026nbspOr as a cocktail suggestion, The Teasmith Southside is a really simple drink that you can make at home.  The Teasmith Gin is available through The Teasmith Gin\u0026rsquos website for \u0026pound38.95 or through the Master of Malt. \u0026nbspAvailable in store at Valhalla\u0026rsquos Goat (Glasgow) and The Gin Company (Edinburgh) and many other stockists listed on their website.

You get jaded. You get cynical. You get used to being hosed in nonsense for 45 minutes each week. And then along comes a moment so unexpected it reminds you it\u0026rsquos not like that at all. It\u0026rsquos actually so much worse.  There was a sombre start, with a minute\u0026rsquos silence in memory of Grenfell. Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh then nodded to the VIP gallery to welcome the latest visiting hardman.  \u0026ldquoAndriy Parubiy, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, the Parliament of the Ukraine, he said.  MSPs looked up cursorily at the delegation in headphones next to the translator\u0026rsquos box.  Tory leader Ruth Davidson started moaning ritually about lags with tags. The SNP was planning \u0026ldquoto release more criminals back into communities, she said, and didn\u0026rsquot care if the blighters cut off their curfew anklets.  \u0026ldquoI certainly hope that the parliamentary authorities allow more than 15 minutes debate for those important issues, she quipped.  So far, so standard. The next 40 minutes stretched agonisingly over the horizon.  And then Richard Leonard showed us just what he\u0026rsquos made of. It was extraordinary. It was a revelation. It was truly the Scottish Labour leader at the peak of his powers  \u0026ldquoCan the First Minister give us another word for a hummingbird\u0026rsquos beak? he asked.  Now, you\u0026rsquore probably thinking I just made that up. But no. I\u0026rsquom a journalist not a surrealist.  \u0026ldquoEh, not immediately, no, replied the First Minister warily, groping for the security alarm under her desk.  The chamber fell silent. The tension crackled. The Ukrainian delegation stirred nervously. Hearts went out to the bloke in the translator\u0026rsquos box tasked with conveying that one to the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.  \u0026lsquoComrade Sturgeon, please to describe the mouth of a tiny chicken,\u0026rsquo he whimpered.  Mr Leonard said the FM\u0026rsquos reply was \u0026ldquounfortunate as the fabled \u0026ldquohummingbird\u0026rsquos beak question was one of the government\u0026rsquos standardised test posers for five-year-olds.  \u0026ldquoLittle wonder that Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers have told me how young and confident children are crushed by these tests, he said, miming the crushing of a five-year-old in a car compactor.  \u0026ldquoThere have been reports of children being driven to tears! he went on. \u0026ldquoTears!  One educational charity had even likened the tests to a traumatic \u0026ldquoadverse childhood experience, he said, conjuring up the image of a hummingbird silhouette slashing at a shower curtain with its hooter.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know what Richard Leonard was doing yesterday, sneered Ms Sturgeon in a tone strongly suggesting she thought it involved concussion.  \u0026ldquoBut I talked to a range of primary school children, including some five-year-olds. I did not meet any who were in tears or see any who looked crushed. I saw confident, bright and enthusiastic young people.  Beaky Leonard reckoned that sounded thoroughly improbable. Standardised tests were flawed and had to stop, he said.  \u0026ldquoFM, will you stop standardised testing for five-year-olds now and put pupils first?  Ms Sturgeon said she would always listen to feedback from teachers - but not Labour.  As for the answer to Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos question? He managed to cock even that up.  It later emerged the test is actually a multiple choice that runs: \u0026ldquoThe hummingbird has a thin beak. What is another word for beak?  Kids, crushed and otherwise, are then asked to choose between skin, bill and body.  Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos choices, meanwhile, appear destined to stay ridicule, failure and obscurity."},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands join SNP after party  39 s dramatic Westminster walk-out","story":"              THOUSANDS of new members have signed up to the SNP in the wake of the party\u0026rsquos dramatic Westminster walk-out.  Nationalist MPs stormed out of the Commons after their Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, was ordered to leave the chamber following a row with the Speaker.  Since then, the SNP said its membership has surged by 5,085 in just 24 hours \u0026ndash putting it on the cusp of being the second largest party in the UK, ahead of the Conservatives.  Deputy leader Keith Brown said the SNP was \u0026ldquothe only party standing up for Scotland and doing all we can to defend the powers of our Parliament.  Mr Blackford was ordered to leave during Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions after clashing with Commons Speaker John Bercow.  The SNP Westminster leader had accused the UK Government of plunging Scotland into a \u0026ldquoconstitutional crisis over its decision to push on with its Brexit Bill despite Holyrood withholding consent.  He attempted to use a parliamentary device by calling for an immediate vote on turning PMQs into a private session. But after repeatedly refusing to sit down, Mr Blackford was ordered to leave the Commons \u0026ndash with the rest of his party\u0026rsquos MPs quickly following suit.  Mr Brown said: \u0026ldquoThe Tories think they can do what they want to Scotland and get away with it, but Scotland has told the Tories loudly and clearly \u0026ndash hands off our parliament.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no wonder people are joining the SNP in their droves \u0026ndash we are the only party standing up for Scotland and doing all we can to defend the powers of our Parliament. That is why 5,085 people have joined the party in the last 24 hours.  \u0026ldquoAs the SNP made clear at PMQs yesterday, this Tory power grab will not be tolerated and we will fight tooth and nail to defend the powers that are rightly held by Holyrood.  It is understood around 50-100 normally join or rejoin the SNP on any given day.  It comes as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned the Tories will pay \"a very, very heavy political price\" for their handling of the Brexit Bill.  Ms Sturgeon said Theresa May\u0027s party had effectively \"ripped up\" the convention underpinning devolution, and \"hoped that nobody would notice\".  Speaking at First Minister\u0027s Questions, she said events at Westminster this week were \"the most clear and powerful evidence so far\" that the system does not work for Scotland.  She addressed MSPs shortly after crowds gathered outside Holyrood to protest against what the SNP claims is a \"Westminster power grab\".  The party\u0027s MPs were left outraged on Tuesday evening when amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate, with the only speech being from Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.  Mr Blackford has warned the SNP will now take \"whatever action is necessary\" to press its case, and will work to \"frustrate\" Theresa May\u0027s administration."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/5072730.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Honeybees deployed to  sniff out  landmines","story":"              THEY are usually found bumbling around from flower to flower, their concerns chiefly revolving around the collecting of pollen and the making of honey.  But now the humble honeybee is being hailed as a potential warzone life-saver after Scottish scientists managed to train them to sniff out landmines.  Researchers at St Andrews University let slip the bees of war in a former Yugoslavian warzone, teaching them to find unexploded ordnance by sniffing out the smell of bombs.  The buzzing insects were released and tracked across what was once a battlefield in Croatia, and then examined when they returned to the hive for tiny traces of explosives.  Once confirmed, footage from drones was used to pinpoint the spot where the bees had been, allowing recover teams to go in and disarm any landmines they found.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspConservationists put out feelers to save Scotland\u0027s bees    Dr Ross Gillander, a research fellow in the department of physics at St Andrews, helped design the equipment which allows the bees to be examined when they come back to their hive.  The project borrows standard Apismellisera Carnica honeybees which are trained over two days by placing sugar syrup on top of some TNT.  \"Basically we teach them by a version of reward like you do with dogs,\" said Dr Gillander.  \"The bees fly out of their hive to go about their normal day to day job of finding pollen but instead of finding pollen they find explosives. It\u0027s the sugar syrup, which draws them out.  \"The training takes two days and is much faster and more efficient than training a dog. However, after three days the bees realise that they aren\u0027t getting reward from the TNT and as a result are disinterested in it and look for other things.  \"After three days we have to re-train the honeybees to detect the explosives.\"  Remarkable video shot from a drone shows how the movement of the mine-hunting bees can be detected by infra red cameras.    READ MORE:\u0026nbspSave our bees - why one Scottish estate is supporting bee keeping and why we should do the same  The footage followed the fluffy pollinators around in the test site, and when the bees stay in the same place, it indicates to researchers they have made a discovery.  Dr Gillander explained this was a first as the flying bugs \"are very small and very fast, which makes them difficult to track\".  Honeybees have an advantage over sniffer dogs when it comes to finding explosives as dogs only work for 15 minutes at a time. Dogs, which are more expensive to train, see it as a \"game\" and quickly get bored.  Bees will work tirelessly and are not affected by the chemical compounds found in explosives. They can get to areas that that are more difficult to get to than dogs.  Dr Gillander, a physicist, designed the equipment that tests the bees for explosives when they return to the hive.  The bees go through a special canvas-type material which is then exposed to light.  \"A drop in light emission (like a light dimmer switch) confirms the presence of explosives,\" said Dr Gillander.  Real-world tests started in Croatia in November last year, funded by NATO Science for Peace and Security, and using bees from local hives.  The types of landmines the insects are being trained to detect are Yugoslavian PMA-2 and PMA-3 mines, along with some Russian or Soviet anti-personnel devices.    READ MORE:\u0026nbspUniversity library in quite a buzz after colony of bees is found in the walls\u0026nbsp  The bees do have drawbacks, however. Rain and darkness will normally deter them from going out on their life-saving missions.  Precise details of the tests are being kept under wraps for now, but Dr Gillander said the use of bees looked \"promising\".  The academic revealed there had so far been just one casualty from the testing - PhD student James Glackin, who was strung three times while driving 6,000 bees to the test site.  The early results of the ongoing trials in Croatia hold out hope that more of the millions of abandoned mines around the world could be cleared up more quickly, sparing thousands of people from being killed or injured.  There are an estimated 110 million land mines lost across the world which kill or injure between 15,000 to 20,000 people annually."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7926358.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Comradeship can never be underestimated","story":"              Scotland\u0026rsquos largest membership charity for veterans is seeking more volunteers to help tackle isolation and loneliness among the Armed Forces community.

One teacher in Edinburgh said they had spent around 70 hours administering the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos standardised tests on their school\u0026rsquos 54 primary one pupils.  It comes as ministers came under increasing pressure to scrap the assessments amid claims some children have been reduced to tears.  In an email sent to Scottish Labour MSP Iain Gray, the Edinburgh primary teacher said they had overseen 30 hours of testing for numeracy and 40 for literacy.  They added: \u0026ldquoThe amount of progress that could have been delivered if those hours were used for effective teaching is significant and instead we were required to use that time to run testing which\u0026hellipis problematic in almost every regard.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the new tests last year as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  But critics insist testing pupils in the first year of primary \u0026ndash as well as in P4, P7 and S3 \u0026ndash piles too much pressure on children and teachers.  Raising the issue at First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers had told him that young, confident children had been \u0026ldquocrushed by the assessments.  Calling for them to be scrapped, he said: \u0026ldquoAt SNP conference John Swinney claimed that we are seeing the start of a renaissance in Scottish education. This \u0026lsquorenaissance\u0026rsquo is driving primary school children to tears.  \u0026ldquoThese tests have been flawed from the very start. Delivered late, \u0026pound2 million over budget and have led to weeks of valuable teaching time lost.  In their email, the Edinburgh teacher \u0026ndash whose identity has been kept anonymous to protect their job \u0026ndash also raised a number of issues with the design and wording of the tests.  They wrote: \u0026ldquoMany of the questions in the tests are very poorly phrased \u0026ndash often at best they are ambiguous and at worst they are so badly written that they are actually misleading.  In one example, children were presented with the problem: \u0026ldquoJane had six grapes on her plate, she ate three of them, choose Jane\u0026rsquos plate.  The teacher said the phrasing of the question made it unclear whether pupils should choose the half-eaten plate, or the original.  They also noted that out of the 54 pupils tested, \u0026ldquonot one child came out as low on the numeracy test, even though some of them only gave a handful of correct answers.  They added: \u0026ldquoThe only conclusion I can reach having watched this process from beginning to end is that these tests have been set up to give a deliberately vague picture which broadly supports the idea that the attainment gap is closing.  \u0026ldquoI cannot use the data from these tests to support my teaching in any way. It does not provide reliable information on any aspect of my children\u0026rsquos learning or development.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, said many of the concerns raised by the teacher had also been brought up by other members.  He said primary teachers faced a logistical challenge as they administered the tests, which require pupils to have access to computers.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe had people at the [latest] conference talking about children being distressed.  Responding to Mr Leonard at FMQs, Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoWe are determined, as I have said on so many occasions, to continue to raise standards in our schools, and to close the attainment gap.  \u0026ldquoAnd being able to assess, in an age-appropriate way, how our young people are doing in school is an important part of that. We will continue to work hard to make sure we do that."},{"url":null,"title":"Nicola Sturgeon hints at law change to crack down on electronic tagging breaches","story":"              NICOLA Sturgeon has hinted she will support changing upcoming legislation to make it an automatic offence for criminals to breach an electronic tagging order.  The First Minister was quizzed by Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who called on her to \"show victims their rights come before criminals for once\".  Ms Davidson said proposals contained in the new Management of Offenders Bill meant it would not be an immediate offence for a criminal to cut off their tag if they have been released on home detention curfew.  She said: \"The First Minister is proposing to release more criminals back to communities, and under those plans a serious offender could be released from prison, could be given a tag, cut it off, breach the terms of their release and incredibly that wouldn\u0027t automatically be considered an offence.

Responding during First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Ms Sturgeon pledged the Scottish Government would \"properly consider any amendment\" to the Bill, which is currently going through Holyrood.

One pro-EU Conservative branded the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos strategy \"sneaky\" while another claimed the wording of a new UK Government amendment was changed to deny MPs the chance of blocking a \"no-deal\" Brexit and sending UK ministers back to the negotiating table should Westminster reject the final agreement.  Earlier this week, Mrs May avoided an almost certain Commons defeat by inviting potential rebels into her private office and assuring them that their concerns about having a \"meaningful vote\" on the final Brexit deal would be addressed.  Yet the PM\u0026rsquos new amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, tabled Thursday evening, leaves Parliament facing a stark \"deal or no deal\" choice.  It says if MPs rejected the final agreement, then Parliament would be offered the opportunity only to vote on a \"neutral motion,\" saying MPs had considered a minister\u0027s statement on the matter.  Crucially, this motion would be unamendable, so MPs could not order Mrs May to go back to the negotiating table, extend the Brexit transition or revoke the UK\u0027s withdrawal under Article 50.  Leading pro-EU Conservative Dominic Grieve said he believed, after a very sensible negotiation with the PM, there had been an agreement, but \u0026ldquoat the last moment part of the text was changed to make the final motion unamendable\u0026hellipIt is unacceptable.  Mr Grieve tabled his own amendment, enabling MPs to dictate the next steps the Government should take in the event of a no deal.  It has now been re-tabled in the Lords, setting the scene for a fresh Government defeat when the Bill returns there on Monday another Commons showdown will occur when it goes back before MPs on Wednesday.  Labour\u0026rsquos Keir Starmer said: \"Theresa May has gone back on her word and offered an amendment that takes the meaning out of the meaningful vote. Parliament cannot - and should not - accept it.\"  Tom Brake for the Liberal Democrats said the PM had been \u0026ldquocaught red-handed making conflicting offers. \u0026ldquoWe are now finding out which lie she was telling.

In a highly critical judgement on the arts funding crisis which engulfed Creative Scotland in January, the MSPs of the Scottish Parliament\u0027s Culture Committee say that its actions has damaged the arts world\u0027s trust in the body.  Creative Scotland must urgently address its strategic failings, the Culture Committee has written, in a 12-page letter to its chief executive, Janet Archer.  In a particularly damaging comment, the cross-party committee says that its handling of the decision making processes for long-term funding of touring theatre and dance \"fell well below the standard that is expected from a non-departmental public body.\"  READ MORE: Inside the Creative Scotland crisis  Creative Scotland now has until the end of August to answer a series of further questions that the committee raise.  The committee has, in particular, criticised the way that Creative Scotland withdrew stable long-term funding from theatre companies, telling them they could apply to a new Touring Fund instead.  The Touring Fund, a source of much of the confusion and anger over the funding decisions, has yet to be officially launched.  The letter says: \"Creative Scotland should have made a decision about touring companies\u0026rsquo eligibility for regular funding before applications were opened and communicated its decision clearly to the sector.  \"The failure to do so has meant that artists and organisations have committed staff and financial resources unnecessarily to complete regular funding applications.  \"This approach has hampered the sector\u0026rsquos trust in Creative Scotland and added to ongoing uncertainty for the sector at a time when the funding pressures on the sector are already high.\"  Read more: The Herald publishes Creative Scotland FOI documents  Creative Scotland, and its funding-decision making process, was plunged into the crisis earlier this year, when it made a series of cuts to theatre companies as part of its crucial Regular Funded Organisation (RFO) spending round.  The uproar over cuts to companies such as Catherine Wheels and Birds of Paradise, as well as other companies such as NVA and the Dunedin Consort, led two board members to resign.  After an emergency board meeting, a U-turn on some, but not all, of the cuts was announced.  MSPs of the committee, which is led by convener Joan McAlpine, heard evidence from Ms Archer and the then-interim chair of the Creative Scotland board, Ben Thomson, on February 22.  It has also gathered evidence, more than 50 responses, from artists and organisations - some of which is scathing.  Ms McAlpine said: \"We received unprecedented levels of representations from within the sector following Creative Scotland\u0026rsquos handling of regular funding for 2018-21.  \"With more than 50 responses from artists and arts organisations, it is clear to us that the confidence of a significant element of the cultural sector in Creative Scotland\u0026rsquos regular funding process has been badly damaged.  \"In particular we felt that the handling of the process in relation to touring theatre and dance companies fell well below the standard that is expected from a non-departmental public body.\"  The deputy convener, Claire Baker, said: \"The committee has expressed serious concern over Creative Scotland\u0026rsquos Regular Funding for the 2018-21 period.  \"We keenly await its written response to the issues we have raised and have set a deadline of 31 August.  \"We will also invite representatives of Creative Scotland to appear before the committee again when Parliament returns from summer recess.\"  Other findings include that the Committee considers it a \"a serious matter that Creative Scotland\u0026rsquos evidence about whether the Board was aware of factual inaccuracies contained in assessment reports before its emergency meeting on 2 February has been challenged by the written evidence received.\"  It also adds: \"The Committee is disappointed that the strategic issues identified by Creative Scotland were not recognised at an earlier stage so that they could be addressed before applications for regular funding were opened.  \"The failure to do so left the sector in a very challenging position and has ultimately had an impact on a significant element of the cultural sector\u0026rsquos confidence in the regular funding process.\"  The Committee also expresses doubts over the decision to award long term funding to \"network organisations\" - bodies which represent or lobby for certain art forms.  It says: \"The cultural sector is concerned that too much regular funding is being directed away from artists towards network organisations.  \"The Committee therefore invites Creative Scotland to consider an alternative model for the funding of network organisations going forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Obstructionist tactics of Parnell  39 s Irish Nationalists should be SNP   39 template   39  say party insiders","story":"              THE obstructionist tactics of the Irish Nationalists under Charles Stewart Parnell in the 19th century should become the \u0026ldquotemplate for the SNP at Westminster in its threat to frustrate UK Government business, party insiders have suggested.  Taking a leaf out of the Irish Parliamentary Party\u0026rsquos book could mean Scottish Nationalist MPs making lengthy speeches, creating innumerable amendments to bills and calling for unnecessary votes tactics designed to \u0026ldquogum up the Westminster system.  In Commons exchanges, SNP MP Stewart McDonald invoked the spirit of Mr Parnell, who led the campaign for Irish Home Rule in the 1880s his bronze bust sits outside party leader Ian Blackford\u0026rsquos Commons office.  Mr McDonald told MPs: \u0026ldquoParnell, of course, along with his colleagues at the time, successfully used the standing orders of the House to frustrate Government business - which is an entirely legitimate tactic - to force them to take Irish issues seriously, including in a 45-hour sitting on the 1877 South Africa Bill.  \u0026ldquoGiven the way that Ireland has this Government over a barrel at the minute, it might just be that those tactics are of interest to honourable members at the present time, said the Glasgow South MP.  In his Herald column today, Kenny Macaskill, the former Scottish Government Justice Secretary, says that Parnell\u0026rsquos Irish Parliamentary Party should now be the \u0026ldquomodel for the SNP at Westminster.  \u0026ldquoUnder the great Charles Stewart Parnell they flourished in the chamber when it suited them but never forgot that their purpose was to leave it, he explains, adding: \u0026ldquoHopefully, that will now be the template for the modern SNP\u0026hellip  Asked about the Nationalist leadership\u0026rsquos threat to frustrate Government business in the Commons, Theresa May\u0026rsquos spokesman stressed how UK ministers had sought to \u0026ldquowork constructively with the Scottish Government and the SNP leadership throughout the Brexit process and would continue to do so.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a matter for the SNP what they choose to do in Parliament.  As reported by The Herald yesterday, the constitutional row over the EU Withdrawal Bill and Holyrood withholding consent looks set to be repeated this autumn over the Government\u0026rsquos Trade Bill as Edinburgh has similar \u0026ldquopower-grab concerns about it.  This means when Whitehall seeks the consent of MSPs on the important legislation, they will almost certainly refuse to give it.  Back in the Commons after his eviction from Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, Mr Blackford claimed the Tory Government had \"totally shafted\" the people of Scotland over Brexit and repeated his call for David Mundell to resign.  The party leader accused the Scottish Secretary of having \"downgraded devolution\" and urged him to apologise for ignoring Holyrood by supporting the Withdrawal Bill.  But Mr Mundell countered by insisting the so-called Sewel Convention was not absolute, explaining how the UK Government would seek consent from Holyrood unless there were \"not normal circumstances applying\". Leaving the EU, he contended, was \u0026ldquonot normal circumstances\".  The Secretary of State claimed the SNP Government had adopted an \u0026ldquounreasonable position from the outset ie \u0026ldquoit would be content with nothing less than a veto on UK matters. This, he said, was unacceptable as it would undermine the integrity of the country\u0027s internal market.  \u0026ldquoWe reached out to Michael Russell to see whether he was willing to engage with that process, explained the Scottish Secretary. \u0026ldquoBut I am afraid the clear message was that the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos position is as it was\u0026hellipand that there is no scope for compromise.

The benefit for job-seekers, which incorporates housing costs and five other benefits into one payment, is also taking far longer to roll out than intended.  \"Universal Credit (UC) has not delivered value for money and it is uncertain that it ever will\", the public spending watchdog said.  The Department for Work and Pensions has admitted itself that it cannot measure whether managing the programme but has itself admitted that it cannot measure whether UC is achieving its policy goal of getting an additional 200,000 people into work.  The roll-out was initially intended to be complete by October 2017, but at present only around one in ten of those eventually expected to be on UC are claiming it.  The NAO also queried claims by the department that people were not suffering difficulties and hardship and satisfaction rates among claimants are high.  It said the DWP had not shown sufficient sensitivity towards some claimants and that it does not know how many claimants are having problems with the programme.  Its report concludes that there is no practical alternative to continuing with rollout of UC but said ministers should make sure the programme does not expand before it has learned from insights it has gained from the roll-out so far.  Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said \u0026ldquoThe Department has kept pushing the Universal Credit rollout forward through a series of problems. We recognise both its determination and commitment, and that there is really no practical choice but to keep on keeping on with the rollout.  \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot think DWP has shown the same commitment to listening and responding to the hardship faced by claimants.  \"We think the larger claims for Universal Credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future. Nor for that matter will value for money.  Critics of the Government\u0027s Universal Credit have seized the report to call for changes to the flagship benefit.  Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"While Universal Credit is working well for some, more than a quarter of a million people are expected to wait longer than five weeks for their first full payment. This puts them at risk of falling behind on bills and getting into debt - a heavy price to pay for a system that isn\u0027t working properly.\"  Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: \"The picture the NAO presents is justifiably bleak.  \"On the ground, new claimants can\u0027t even be sure they will be paid in full and on time, and how many people will be helped into work by the benefit is far from clear.\"  Margaret Greenwood, shadow DWP secretary, said: \"The Government has shamelessly ignored warning after warning about the devastating impact their flagship welfare reform has had on people\u0027s lives.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Ian McConnell  Britain seems like such a funny little country when the Brexiters bluster","story":"              BRITAIN sometimes seems like a funny little country these days.  True, it still ranks as one of the world\u0026rsquos big economies. But Chancellor Philip Hammond conceded in November that it had fallen from fifth to sixth-biggest, having been overtaken by France. And the UK\u0026rsquos own woeful performance and policy errors, and the rise of other countries, such as India, look set to ensure the drift down the rankings continues.  It is important to recognise that a country\u0026rsquos standing on the international stage is about much more than just size. It is also about influence, and attitude, and behaviour. Unfortunately for the UK, there is surely no arguing with the assertion that, in the strange days since the Brexit vote, the description of \u0026ldquofunny little could be applied to the mindset of so many Brexiters when it comes to the wider world.  It has been another most curious, though unfortunately no less lamentable, week on the Brexit front.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Taiwan strives for regional cooperation as UK turns back on partners with Brexit  We have had blustering Tory Brexiters in the House of Commons declaim (to summarise) that the people voted for Brexit and they must not be denied it.  In the same week, we have had a further raft of dismal economic figures which show the UK, weighed down by Brexit uncertainty, is in grim shape even before we get to the horrors of the actual breakaway from the huge free-trade bloc.  Yet, we are told, the Brexiters will jolly well have what they voted for. They will not be swayed by the realities of the situation, which they seem to regard as propaganda by people they oh-so-tiresomely refer to as \u0026ldquoRemoaners. Albeit the schoolboyish \u0026ldquoRemoaner jibe is certainly preferable to the \u0026ldquotraitor comments you sometimes hear bandied around when it comes to Brexit. \u0026ldquoTraitor is an extreme word, and its use by some Leave voters underlines the divisive and intolerant nature of Brexit.  Fears over the state of the UK economy intensified this week when official data revealed the sharpest monthly drop in manufacturing output since October 2012. The 1.4 per cent month-on-month plunge will surely be a disappointment to some in the Brexit camp (even if they will not admit it). It highlights not only the domestic economic malaise but also the fact that sterling weakness arising from the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit vote does not appear to have been the catalyst for a lasting export boom.  Read More: Fears over UK economy intensify as manufacturing output plunges  Not than anyone should have expected it to be such a catalyst. After all, you would imagine all the uncertainty around trade arrangements after Blighty quits the European Union would not be trumped by a pricing advantage for UK exporters arising from sterling weakness. Especially given the pound\u0026rsquos troubles have sent UK companies\u0026rsquo import costs rocketing.  Also this week, we have had figures from the Office for National Statistics signalling underlying weakness in the UK construction sector. The data showed construction output rose by just 0.5% in April, having tumbled by 2.3% in March as freezing weather disrupted activity. Economists had forecast construction output would have bounced back by 2% in April.  Meanwhile, trade figures this week from the ONS were dire.  The UK\u0026rsquos global goods trade deficit widened from \u0026pound12 billion in March to \u0026pound14.04bn in April, much worse than the \u0026pound11.35bn forecast by economists, as exports fell sharply and imports rose. The deterioration was driven by a widening of the UK\u0026rsquos deficit on trade in goods with countries outwith the EU, from \u0026pound3.79bn to \u0026pound5.37bn.

The Brexiters\u0026rsquo head-in-the-British-sand attitude has meant the absence of any catalyst for their imagined boom in UK trade with countries outside the EU has not dampened their bizarre enthusiasm.  At the end of the day, Brexit is a fool\u0026rsquos errand driven by ideology and not by considerations of people\u0026rsquos standards of living, which are dictated in large part by economic success or otherwise. Xenophobia and opposition to immigration look to have been key factors in the Brexit vote.  You still hear the Brexiters bang on about the benefits of leaving the EU. These remain entirely elusive but that, it seems, does not matter one whit to the Brexiters. All the while, some of them harp on about the fabulous bounties which Blighty is going to reap from a raft of new free-trade deals.

Read More: Ian McConnell: Fears for economy grow as millions hit by Brexit cost of living crisis  And what about the growing protectionism when it comes to world trade? One of those countries at the forefront of this is the US, which some in the UK Government seem to believe is going to be falling over itself to do one of the fastest-arranged trade deals of modern times with Britain, even though nothing of substance has happened on this front in the two years since the Brexit vote.  Meanwhile, there is no sign that the other countries which the UK Government has had its sights on, in its desperate lobbying mission to try to make Brexit look like a good idea, will be putting Britain ahead of the massive and powerful EU bloc in the queue for trade deals. Why would these countries prioritise foolishly by putting an isolated UK ahead of the huge EU bloc?  And this brings us back to the essence of the problem.  The UK is a sizeable economy. However, its influence is dwindling as other countries rise. Faced with such challenges, being part of a powerful bloc such as the EU has been hugely important.  Many in the Brexit camp seem to believe the UK is the most important country in the world. They need to wake up to the fact the UK Government\u0026rsquos ridiculously over-elevated sense of the country\u0026rsquos importance does not chime at all with the reality of today\u0026rsquos world.

Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing. We continuously hear incredible stories including a mentee who went from a homeless unit to medical school and another who had to contend with family addiction issues and was four years behind in their education to graduating university and becoming a building surveyor.\u0026ldquoTheir stories, among countless other, have spurred us to roll out this project nationwide and we look forward to hearing of the successes of North-east youngsters in the years to come.The first information event for individuals and businesses keen to support the programme in the North-east will be held at The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos office in Aberdeen on Monday, June 18.To register, or for more information on future events, please contact Alison.maclachlan@thewoodfoundation.org.uk.

The issue was raised with Mr Clark by a constituent at a recent surgery, Alfred Middleton from Inverurie, who is a shareholder in RBS.                                                    The claimants secured a £200million settlement from RBS last summer.        However, solicitors for the claimants have not yet received all the money from RBS and only about £25million has been paid to investors so far. A legal battle is ongoing between the Action Group Company and Manx Capital, the investment vehicle and major claimant that took control of the mass legal claim and secured the settlement on behalf of the claimants..In his letter, Mr Clark said that investigations by a Sunday newspaper had raised serious questions about the credibility of the Action Group Company.He has joined parliamentary colleagues including Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP and co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking in calling for an inquiry.Mr Clark said: \u0026ldquoThis is an issue that was raised with me by a constituent that is directly affected by issues with the settlement agreed with RBS last summer.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoMany RBS shareholders believe that the rights issue undertaken by RBS in 2008 was promoted on a misleading basis.\u0026ldquoThey believe there were serious omissions of information which should have been brought to the attention of investors.\u0026ldquoThe RBS Shareholders Action Group Company was set up in 2009 purportedly to represent the interests of those investors.\u0026ldquoHowever, since the £200million settlement was agreed, a very small fraction of that sum has been paid out.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoThere are serious concerns about the Action Group Company and the lack of regulation in place to protect shareholders.\u0026ldquoI have now written to the Justice Secretary to join calls for an investigation into the RBS Shareholders Action Group Company, which should happen as a matter of urgency.
