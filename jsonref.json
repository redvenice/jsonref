His lawyers have written to the government outlining his appeal.They said: \u0027The notice says that the use of the property for short-term visitor stays \u0027is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity\u0027.          Mr Cameron says that he has welcomed hen parties to the property for at least 10 years without incident \u0027Mr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed that if he addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.\u0027They added: \u0027He was therefore surprised to receive the notice when he knew that he was already actively engaging with the council and taking all reasonable measures to deal with the issues raised by those who were complaining.\u0027Mr Cameron said he had made plans to remove two hot tubs from the rear of the house and move a barbecue area in a bid to combat disturbance.He also said he would install a night \u0027duty officer\u0027 to help monitor noise levels and provide concerned neighbours with a direct contact line to voice complaints. The house website features several reviews from guests.One said: \u0027We booked Linton Lodge for its location to Edinburgh and the fact it slept so many.

This house made a hen party into a trip I will never forget. It was just perfect.\u0027The council had written to Mr Cameron outlining their position. They said: \u0027The regular turnover of visitors, combined with guests having access to outside entertainment areas is having a detrimental impact on neighbouring residential amenity.\u0027In terms of the character of the property, the house while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate 15-30 guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.\u0027The characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.\u0027As stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to various council departments, including Environmental health and the Anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.\u0027Taking cognisance of the above, a material change of use of the property from a dwelling house providing residential accommodation to a short stay commercial visitor accommodation has occurred.\u0027Police Scotland confirmed they had been called to the property in the summer.

I think New York City got to him a little bit.\u0027You need to have great constraint to have a disciplined life there. All of that leads to getting too much drugs or bad drugs and overdosing.\u0027 Last night, Scott Rogowsky, the primary host of live game show Trivia HQ, paid tribute to Kroll - with a video message on the app. Rogowsky praised Kroll for changing \u0027the game twice, first with Vine and then with this very app that you\u0027re hearing and seeing me through right now.\u0027 \u0027HQ Trivia, the game show that you love so much, would not exist without him,\u0027 he added. Rogowsky called Kroll a \u0027good friend and colleague\u0027 and said he was a person of \u0027compassion and generosity\u0027. \u0027His sudden loss leaves all of us here at HQ shocked and deeply saddened,\u0027 the host continued. \u0027Colin was also a loving son and brother and our thoughts and sympathies are with his family at this time.\u0027 \u0027Out of respect there will be no show tonight, but we will resume our regularly scheduled programming with HQ Trivia tomorrow night.\u0027           Police found Kroll dead in his apartment in Manhattan (pictured) shortly after midnight Sunday morning with drugs believed to be cocaine and heroin nearby          HQ and Vine co-founder Rus Yusupov (pictured with Kroll) later tweeted his condolences            \u0027I found a good deal of negative sentiment about Colin and the Vine team and some discomfort with his behavior, but I did not find evidence that warrants his removal from the company,\u0027 Liew said in a statement. Kroll later told Axios that the experience was \u0027eye-opening\u0027 and a \u0027catalyst for professional development and greater awareness in the office\u0027. \u0027I now realize that there are things I said and did that made some feel unappreciated or uncomfortable.

You need to have great constraint to have a disciplined life there.\u0027 \u0027All of that leads to getting too much drugs or bad drugs and overdosing.\u0027 Alan, who was aware that his son used drugs recreationally, said that Kroll recently had talked about moving away from New York. \u0027He had so much talent and had accomplished so much at such a young age. It truly is a waste,\u0027 he added. \u0027At 34, imagine the things he\u0027d done and the skills he had.

Founder of Berlin-based project management software company Planio, Jan Schulz-Hofen (pictured), introduced the four-day week to his staff earlier this yearBut many are exceeding 40 hours a week anyway - with the United States leading the way, where 49 percent said they worked overtime.\u0027There has been work creep. Because you always have the technology, you are always working, so people are getting burned out,\u0027 said Dan Schawbel, director of executive development firm Future Workplace, which conducted the survey.Schulz-Hofen, a 36-year-old software engineer, tested the four-day week on himself after realising he needed to slow down following a decade of intense work launching Planio, whose tools allowed him to track his time in detail.\u0027I didn\u0027t get less work done in four days than in five because in five days, you think you have more time, you take longer, you allow yourself to have more interruptions, you have your coffee a bit longer or chat with colleagues,\u0027 Schulz-Hofen said.\u0027I realized with four days, I have to be quick, I have to be focused if I want to have my free Friday.\u0027Schulz-Hofen and his team discussed various options before settling on everybody working Monday to Thursday. They rejected the idea of flexible hours because it adds administrative complexity, and were against a five-day week with shorter hours as it is too easy for overwork to creep back in.Clients who call on a Friday hear a recorded message explaining why nobody is at the office.\u0027We got an unexpected reaction from customers. Most of our clients did not complain. They were just jealous,\u0027 Schulz-Hofen said.Grey New York, an ad agency owned by WPP, launched a program in April to allow staff to work a four-day week for 85 percent of their full-time salary.Schawbel expects the idea to catch on in more companies and countries, but probably not his own: \u0027I think America will be the last country to give us Monday mornings off because we\u0027re so used to this way of working.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/17/5171196-6291509-image-a-83_1539881672295.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles father reveals texts day never replies","story":"    Thomas Markle (pictured today) used an unpaid interview with GMB to again beg his daughter Meghan to stop ignoring his texts and letters and \u0027reach out\u0027          Meghan\u0027s father hopes that the Queen might intervene to heal his fractured relationship with his daughter and son in law (pictured at the The Royal Variety Performance in November)Meghan\u0027s supposedly banned Harry from a traditional Boxing...Academics accuse Meghan Markle of dropping her feminist...The Queen is set to hand the Duchess of Sussex her first...Kensington Palace confirms William and Kate WILL spend...Share this articleIn an extraordinary and wide-ranging interview, the retired Hollywood lighting engineer told GMB:          Meghan, pictured a week ago at The Fashion Awards 2018, is pregnant with her first child but has cut off contact with her fatherThomas Markle describes his youngest child as \u0027very controlling\u0027 and \u0027always in charge\u0027Meghan has \u0027ghosted\u0027 her own father since she married Prince Harry in MayMr Markle texts every day and has sent letters to Kensington Palace but has heard \u0027nothing\u0027Reclusive 74-year-old hopes that the Queen will now intervene at Sandringham over Christmas to repair the fissure in the Markle familyMr Markle believes his daughter\u0027s first child - due next April - could \u0027soften\u0027 rift and still hopes to meet his grandchildMeghan cut off contact with her father after he failed to walk her down the aisle and has rebuffed all his attempts to make contact with her since then.  But Mr Markle hopes the birth of her child will break down that \u0027barrier\u0027, adding: \u0027I think she will make a great mum and maybe things will soften a bit and we will get back in contact\u0027.He added: \u0027I\u0027m certainly hoping that everything goes well that they produce a beautiful baby.

French plain clothes policemen block a \u0027yellow vest\u0027 protester during a riot in Nantes over the weekend          Lamenting the \u0027sad\u0027 situation in the country, Czaputowicz (pictured) told Polish television channel Polsat News: \u0027France is the sick man of Europe, it is a drag on Europe while Poland is a bright spot    The father of Strasbourg terrorist Cherif Chekatt (pictured) has said his son believed ISIS \u0027fought for a good cause\u0027He is suspected of helping to provide the pistol used by Cherif Chekatt, a career criminal who shot dead five people and wounded 11 at the market last Tuesday night, judicial sources said.Chekatt, who was on a list of possible extremist security risks, was shot and killed by police after a two-day manhunt in the city.The alleged associate will be brought before a judge in Paris on Monday, the prosecutors\u0027 office in the capital said.Six other people detained in the wake of Tuesday\u0027s attack, including Chekatt\u0027s parents and two of his brothers, have been released without charge.Four of the five people killed in Tuesday\u0027s attack were foreigners or born abroad.One was a 45-year-old Thai tourist, and another a 45-year-old Franco-Afghan garage owner who fled his country 20 years ago.A 28-year-old Italian journalist, in town to cover the European parliament, was also shot and killed, as was a 36-year-old former Pole who had lived in Strasbourg for the past 20 years.The dead also included a 61-year-old Frenchman who had just retired and was shot in the head as he stepped out of a restaurant.                                                     A source at the Paris police prefecture said: \u0027If a large crowd forced barriers through the security perimeter, then the powder would be used as a last resort in order to stop them.\u0027But it is sure to raise concerned questions among civic rights groups, as well as monitoring organisations, including the Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, of which France is a member.Colonel Richard Carminache, of the Gendarmerie, confirmed that the controversial devices had \u0027never been used in cities to my knowledge.\u0027Each distribution would result in \u0027a highly concentrated teargas cloud, the equivalent of 200 grenades in one go,\u0027 said Col. Carminache, who added: \u0027It\u0027s best to run to get out\u0027.Teargas is classed as a chemical weapon, and is actually banned from warzones, in line with international agreements.Yet French gendarmes and police – who have been criticised during the latest law and order crisis for acts of extreme violence against civilians – use it constantly.In Britain, teargas use is heavily restricted, and never used indiscriminately against large crowds containing men, women and children, as happens in France."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/17/09/1A843FB200000514-0-image-m-16_1545038354987.jpg","title":"Beefeaters strike picket Tower London","story":"    Beefeaters at the Tower of London will picket the gates of the ancient castle on January 8.

Mr Cameron says that he has welcomed hen parties to the property for at least 10 years without incident \u0027Mr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed that if he addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.\u0027They added: \u0027He was therefore surprised to receive the notice when he knew that he was already actively engaging with the council and taking all reasonable measures to deal with the issues raised by those who were complaining.\u0027Mr Cameron said he had made plans to remove two hot tubs from the rear of the house and move a barbecue area in a bid to combat disturbance.He also said he would install a night \u0027duty officer\u0027 to help monitor noise levels and provide concerned neighbours with a direct contact line to voice complaints. The house website features several reviews from guests.One said: \u0027We booked Linton Lodge for its location to Edinburgh and the fact it slept so many.

This house made a hen party into a trip I will never forget. It was just perfect.\u0027The council had written to Mr Cameron outlining their position. They said: \u0027The regular turnover of visitors, combined with guests having access to outside entertainment areas is having a detrimental impact on neighbouring residential amenity.\u0027In terms of the character of the property, the house while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate 15-30 guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.\u0027The characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.\u0027As stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to various council departments, including Environmental health and the Anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.\u0027Taking cognisance of the above, a material change of use of the property from a dwelling house providing residential accommodation to a short stay commercial visitor accommodation has occurred.\u0027Police Scotland confirmed they had been called to the property in the summer.

It was the one time of the year for him to really shine and I guess if my dad had one favorite day of the year, it would be Christmas.\u0027He goes really upbeat and Santa Claus-y. His favorite holiday of the year is Christmas.\u0027But the 52-year-old fears his ailing 74-year-old father might spend this Christmas alone at his Rosarito, Mexico, home without so much as a card from Meghan for company.Thomas Jr, who was reconciled with his father in a California meeting that was exclusively revealed by DailyMail.com earlier this year, says he hopes Meghan will put any animosity aside and contact him.The 52-year-old cannot join his father himself because he has already agreed to join his fiancée Darlene Blount, 38, and her son for the festivities but says Markle Sr would be welcome if he wanted to come to their home in Grants Pass.He said: \u0027I hope he doesn\u0027t spend Christmas by himself in Mexico and at least goes to Samantha but I think he\u0027ll probably be a little hurt if he doesn\u0027t get a Christmas card.

This family rift has been going on for quite some time now and I think Christmas is the one time of year when you do need to get together with your family - good, bad or indifferent, put everything aside and at least enjoy the holidays.\u0027For himself, he says he doesn\u0027t believe he\u0027ll be contacted by his famous half-sister but hopes that might change in the New Year.He told DailyMail.com: \u0027I\u0027d be really surprised if I got a call from Meghan at Christmas or a Christmas card but that would be really nice.\u0027With everything that\u0027s gone on for the last two years, I think the New Year is the perfect time for a new beginning for her, for the family.\u0027Just to start over, start fresh and make some sort of contact. Definitely to let my father see his grandchild when it\u0027s born.\u0027I would feel pretty honored if she opened up her door and invited the Markles in to see their new relative, the new baby. It would mean a lot.\u0027To the rest of the clan, he added: \u0027Let\u0027s forget the rifts of the past, the bad things of the past and go on and be friendly to each other again.

Don’t panic – our guide will help you get organised, giving you more time to relax and enjoy the festive season. Find out how to be a savvy Christmas shopper with our expert tips.Start earlyIt’s never too soon in December to think about Christmas purchases, says Amanda McCall, director at Gifts International. “The chronic procrastinators among us may not like to admit it, but the only way to do a good job on your Christmas shopping is to start early. We’ve all left buying an important gift until the last minute at some point, but you’re simply not going to find the perfect present if you’re dashing around the shops in a panic on Christmas Eve. So, this year, leave yourself plenty of time.”Be online shopping savvyBe organised about your online shopping and you’ll save time and money. “Decide on some themes from what you know about your family and friends,” says Lena Gore, co-owner of online retail company Find Me A Gift.Simon Exton from AO agrees: “I have lots of young nieces and nephews, so I decided that I was going to buy gaming stuff for them.”Put key dates in your diaryGet familiar with the last posting dates - this year, it’s 18 December for second class, 20 December for first class, 21 December for Royal Mail Tracked 24, and 22 December for Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed.Ask for suggestionsWe all want to give presents that our loved ones actually want. So rather than stressing about finding the perfect surprise, just ask them, says Lucy Ward, creative brand director at online marketplace Trouva. “More often than not, surprises can be a bit of a disappointment, and, in a world that’s thinking more sustainably, we want to be giving less and giving better gifts. I’m an advocate of just straight up asking people what they want. That way, you can guarantee your gift isn’t going to waste.”Stick to your budgetAgain, starting early is key to making sure you don’t spend too much. Make sure you know exactly how much you want to spend – Gore recommends working out an overall budget first, then inidual gift budgets. And she suggests subscribing to the newsletters of the websites you’re thinking of using, to keep an eye on their offers. “Buy as soon as you see an offer you like. If you leave it until the last minute, you’re more likely to impulse buy, which may mean breaking your budget.”Check your delivery datesMcCall recommends going for nominated day delivery options whenever possible. This means you can pick a time and day convenient for you, which is particularly helpful during the busy festive season. “You can also arrange for gifts to arrive while your family are out, so it won’t spoil the surprise before Christmas morning.” Check the delivery options available before you buy: electricals specialist AO offers free delivery on all items, including its Christmas gift ideas and stocking fillers, and provides both click and collect and next-day delivery.Be preparedAvoid the stress of unexpected visitors by stockpiling extra gifts, says McCall. “It’s always lovely to see family and friends during the festive season, but it can be quite embarrassing if you receive a gift and have nothing to offer in return.” She recommends keeping a few festive gifts wrapped up with the tags blank, so you can fill them out at a moment’s notice. “Chances are they’ll never even realise it was a last-minute gift.”Visit AO for great ideas for Christmas gifts and stocking fillers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccf1d1aa9648925db063971e9e31f639b1a7624/0_47_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37ed961b78c3803744b4319f9eda9eaa","title":"practical makes perfect why the best gifts are the useful ones","story":"We’ve either got gadgets coming out of our ears or we’re jammed into city flatshares too cramped for tat. Is it any wonder many gift recipients simply want something whose function will enhance their lives?Christmas present buyers generally fall into two camps. There are those who believe a present should be thoughtful and sentimental and whimsical, a touch of decadent luxury you would never buy for yourself – think champagne truffles, sparkly gloves or fancy underwear. Then there are the practical gift-givers, the functional Father Christmases, who want to buy a present they know will actually be useful – even if that means wrapping up a microwave oven. But is it possible to find that sweet spot between the two?“With a rising awareness of sustainability, and a general sense of “peak stuff”, we’re seeing people increasingly lean towards either experiences, as opposed to a physical gift, or presents that are more meaningful and useful,” says Lucie Greene, trend forecaster at JWT Innovation. “The era of frivolous novelty junk is almost over. It’s a tax on the planet, and adds nothing to our lives, especially when many live in cities, where space is at a premium.”So those £1 flashing reindeer socks are out, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have a dose of sentimentality in our stocking fillers. “I think the movement in gifting is towards more considered and thoughtful presents,” says Greene. “This ties in with the growing influence of Nordic philosophy, which is to focus on quality over quantity.” Whether it’s food, furniture, electrical items or clothing, buying gifts that are seasonless, of high quality and well-designed is always appreciated. “We might be buying less and spending less, but we’re putting more thought in.”Interestingly, being too thoughtful might actually be making us worse present-givers. According to a 2014 study from the Journal of Consumer Research, we imagine our loved ones will want a gift that is impressive, expensive, and sentimental. And yet gift receivers actually report being happier when they get exactly what they asked for. For coffee aficionados, that might mean getting a top-notch, luxury coffee maker, although your average Joe might be happier with a simpler machine.“Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful” was designer and poet William Morris’s golden rule, and it’s a pretty good rule of thumb for presents too. But, of course, the definition of useful is pretty subjective one person’s deeply practical, everyday item is another’s frivolous folly.“Try to think about a person’s interests and what they like to do on a daily basis, and then elevate it so that you make it a bit special,” says Polly Hadden-Paton, a professional gift-buyer tasked with buying last-minute gifts for many famous or busy clients.As with many trends that have become mainstream, millennials were early adopters of what’s been called “stealth luxury”. David Burstein, author of Fast Future: How the Millennial Generation Is Shaping Our World, explains: “The younger generation came of age at a time when spending lots of money on flash things had a negative connotation, thanks to the 2008 financial crisis. While a few decades ago Yuppies splashed their cash on expensive gadgets for their significant others, such as watches and jewellery, now Muppies (that’s millennial yuppies, FYI) are more likely to want to receive high-value items that serve a purpose and add real value to their lives, such as iPhones or Nutribullets.”Veer too far towards utility, of course, and you’ll find yourself in the doghouse. “I had a friend whose mother-in-law bought her a drying rack for Christmas,” recalls Hadden-Paton. “That’s probably a bit too practical.”Visit AO for great ideas for Christmas gifts and stocking fillers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfd7c1ec0e7dd10eada046f5e340928c26ddfa96/0_0_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5cc37abf797038b5aa571db9b03d29e","title":"top toys for 2018 and the 500 extra youll spend five facts about christmas shopping","story":"Expect to see slime and the Boxer robot topping children’s gift lists, plenty of online shopping, and more socks under the treeWe spend the equivalent of two working weeks preparing for ChristmasChristmas is time-consuming.

Ministers placed an export bar on the item to allow a UK gallery time to raise the necessary funds.It was announced on Monday that NGS had done just that and the phone will go on display this week at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh.Simon Groom, NSG’s director of modern and contemporary art, said the item filled an important gap. “This major acquisition cements our position as one of the world’s greatest collections of surrealist art … Before this acquisition we had nothing of this kind.”The lobster phone was made in 1938, one of 11 commissioned by Edward James, the eccentric and wealthy patron of surrealist artists. The lobsters were made to fit bakelite telephones at his house in Wimpole Street, central London, and his country house Monkton in West Sussex. Four are red and the others white.Almost all of them are in museum collections around the world, including a red one owned by Tate Modern and a white one in the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.The phone was put up for sale by the Edward James Foundation, which had two. It had initially been  expected to fetch between £150,000 and £250,000. The funds for the NGS acquisition came from the Art Fund, which provided £100,000, and the Henry and Sula Walton Fund, which gave £753,000.Henry Walton was a professor of psychiatry at the University of Edinburgh and Sula Wolff was a renowned child psychiatrist. They left their collection to NGS and set up the fund to help the galleries acquire major works.Groom said works such as the lobster telephone had a huge impact on artists such as Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst.Stephen Deuchar, the director of the Art Fund, said it was proud to have helped to buy such an important work. “Dalí’s lobster telephone is amongst the most famous of all surrealist objects, typifying the spirit of the movement in its witty, subversive eccentricity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04e11b5dd32f0132cdb61715e60e0ff6303c7edb/290_8_4494_2696/master/4494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95260783a945ffd98655271743089926","title":"meps to scrutinise exxonmobil alleged role in climate change misinformation","story":"Campaigners welcome move over claims firm knew of global warming dangers for decadesExxonMobil’s alleged role in spreading misinformation about climate change will be scrutinised by the European Union for the first time, in a move welcomed by campaigners.The world’s biggest international oil company has been investigated in the US over allegations that it knew about the dangers of global warming for decades but deceived the public over the risks, a charge the firm has rejected.EU politicians will now turn their attention to the role the company has played in Europe, where it has a sizeable presence from the huge Groningen gas field in the Netherlands to oil and gas fields in the North Sea.MEPs on the environment, public health and food safety committee will quiz a series of speakers on misinformation campaigns on climate change, which could include representatives of the company.The hearing on 21 March, jointly held by the petitions committee, comes after a petition by fossil fuel campaigners calling for a closer look at the information the company “wants to withhold from us now”.“ExxonMobil has misled the public on climate change for over 40 years. Now it’s time to correct the record and hold them accountable,” said Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of Food \u0026amp Water Europe, which organised the petition.She called on the the new US Congress to follow the European parliament’s lead.“The weak outcome of the climate negotiations in Poland show that we can’t wait – leaders everywhere must take climate denial and climate action seriously,” she said, in reference to the UN climate talks which concluded on Saturday.The group would like to see lobbyists for the company barred from Brussels because of the firm’s alleged past behaviour.Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP for South West England and Gibraltar, agreed that lobbying of EU institutions by companies that had been linked to climate denial should not be permitted.She said: “Exxon has a shameful history of funding climate change denial – paying for fake science and dangerous lies that have prevented us from taking timely action on climate change and forcing the world into the current climate crisis.”An ExxonMobil spokesperson said: “We unequivocally reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research contained in media reports that are inaccurate distortions of ExxonMobil’s nearly 40-year history of climate research. We understand that climate risks are real.”In recent years the company has softened its stance on climate change, urging the US to stay in the Paris climate agreement and agreeing to join an industry alliance on climate change.The company has recently been targeted by shareholders calling on it to set carbon targets at ExxonMobil’s AGM next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46c096203b396a3e75c6c396b8550b57406910c1/0_0_1023_614/master/1023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93946568d24d590286bbe6f5daa4345f","title":"blair may brexit spat prime minister","story":"The former prime minister has been accused by the incumbent of attempting to subvert Brexit. Is there no respite? In the latest instalment of can you absolutely not, we have brand new beef to digest. Tony Blair in the red corner, blood still oozing years later from his forays into the Middle East and in the blue, Theresa May, covered in indigo bruising inflicted by her own colleagues. Truly, this is a ringside seat nobody wanted, like the stained front pew of a night bus.Blair – who looks increasingly like a waxwork of himself – re-entered political life with the establishment of an institute to tackle the rise of populism. This past weekend he was in Brussels, and has talked of reversing Brexit as his new “mission”. Given that Blair holds no actual political post, this has the vibe of a kid with a toy steering wheel convinced he’s driving (see also: Paul Gascoigne, Raoul Moat John Terry changing into full kit after a Champions League final he did not play in).On Blair’s intervention and support for a second referendum, May has come out swinging, as though somebody lit a fire under her usual woodenness. May called Blair’s Brussels trip “irresponsible” and his comments “an insult to the office he once held”, which is weird, given she was fine with his controversial dealings in South Sudan, his advisory work in Kazakhstan (big fan of torture) and him taking £9m from the Saudis for “consultancy”. Then again, May is pretty cosy with the crown prince herself. Which is sort of hypocritical, but this is the woman who calls herself a feminist but last week reinstated the whip to two men with allegations of sexual impropriety hanging over them, so.Blair hit back, saying in response to her charge of a second referendum being “undemocratic” that: “Far from being anti-democratic it would be the opposite, as indeed many senior figures in her party from past and present have been saying.”Whatever one thinks about Blair, and it is impossible really not to think many different things, the stability he offered over three terms (even throughout his constant bickering with Gordon Brown, whom he described working with as “having dental work with no anaesthetic”) does now seem luxurious. The positive social changes he implemented (minimum wage, action against poverty, help for parents) have since been threatened by a Tory government now dangerously dicing with his other signature achievement, the Good Friday agreement.But it’s, well, a bit rich of rich Blair, the man who took the UK into a war based on phoney evidence – very much against the will of the people (1 million marched against the war) – to point out that a significant portion of the population does not want Brexit, and that the campaign was based on lies. It’s unclear whether the lies take 45 minutes each to reach us. But at least he achieved things. Unlike another former prime minister who just isn’t taking the hint.Enter David Cameron. Up until now he has been either ensconced in his £25,000 shed or, as Danny Dyer memorably put it, “in Nice with his trotters up”. Not any more, now he is apparently being asked by May for advice. Given that she went full scorched earth post-Cameron, this seems strange, but perhaps is a reflection of him telling hacks last week that the PM has his support and wants to “let her get on with the job”. Even though her current competence in the job is akin to an intern stapling their tie repeatedly to the desk.Cameron insists he is busy “doing some work” on his book, progress on which so far seems to be along the lines of buying an entire new set of stationery and a pencil case before the start of term in the hope of a miraculous productivity boost. But he is apparently “bored shitless” away from Westminster, which is nice for him, with the rest of us all up shit creek in the middle of a shitstorm absolutely shitting ourselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffadfa9c29f360a0d110e71940fc1226d8ca77fe/0_0_4510_2706/master/4510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e696ca014c95870f8aad86797dabebb","title":"rightwing cult brexit britain cliff edge","story":"Happy Brexit Christmas, everyone. This is not taking back control this is no one in control, as bad economic news batters in day after day. Storm warnings of a global Trump trade war threaten, but the Brexit limbo is causing our own made-in-Britain slump. We are not yet at the cliff edge, just slipping down a mudslide of decline.Those gap-toothed shopping parades, emptiest in the poorest places, sap public confidence. Vanishing landmark department stores look like emblems of national decline, amid distant Westminster warfare over backstops and WTO rules. Bad news takes on a Brexit inflection that makes the merry insouciance of Brexiteers look even more delusional. Leadership hopefuls shamelessly playing fast and loose with the future of the economy, in pursuit of crazed ambition, add to the mood of chaos. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, an erstwhile remainer, pretends to think the country will “flourish and prosper” with no deal, as “we’ve faced bigger challenges in our history”. (Yes, but never through acts of random self-destruction such as this.) Professed enthusiasm to lead Britain into a no-deal Brexit ought to be a disqualification on the grounds of diminished mental capacity.But Hunt was duly saluted by the Sun’s Trevor Kavanagh as “the first senior minister to publicly back a Full British Brexit – precisely what 17.4m voters ordered”. Did they, precisely? How does anyone know? That’s the heart of the argument for a final-say referendum. No one could know last time with what deal, on what terms, we might leave the EU. There was no tick-box available to express an option on the ballot papers.All those Tory MPs who engineered this political crisis, elected on a manifesto promising a nation-splitting referendum, had no idea what the deal would be. They don’t even agree now on what the referendum meant, or what the outcome should be. Obliged to face the consequences of their foolhardy action, they keep changing their minds, just as voters do. Only months ago Hunt said: “No deal would be a mistake we would regret for generations” – and he is only one of myriad swivellers, currently moving in all directions.So when Theresa May told the Commons that she still hoped to get a legally binding time limit to her backstop, no one knew what her final draft would be. Yet she still claimed a public vote on this unknowable deal would “break faith with the British people”. She knows, we know, everyone knows that’s hokum on stilts. Despite delaying the “meaningful” vote to within a hair’s breadth of the 21 January deadline, the possibility of a referendum grows a little closer every day, as every other option fails to win support. May’s adamantine refusal to consider a vote can join all her other dead red lines. What else can she do but change her mind, as people must when faced with no alternative?Riots! Blood on the streets! MPs of the traditional law-and-order party can already be heard justifying a future pro-Brexit rampage if the referendum happens. Against what? Against the electorate being given a democratic choice on how or whether to leave the EU on the terms on offer. Riots against democracy would be a British first. The vehemence of Brexiteer opposition shows they fear they would lose, so Charles Moore in the  calls for a boycott. A low turnout lets them reject the result – and that’s low politics.This is the ferocious politics of the last ditch, and ultimately it’s not about trade or even about protecting the economy. This is the most profound political dispute of our lifetimes, with EU membership only a flimsy cover story. A revolutionary cult has captured the Conservative party, whose crystal-clear agenda they never dare reveal when broadcasting. You have to read their outriders to understand their project.In the  and the Spectator, writers openly advocate Trumpian policies. Take the last Sunday  comment section: the leader calls for “massive tax cuts” and “unilateral free trade”, at a stroke killing off farming and manufacturing with cheap, unregulated imports “radical deregulation” is advocated by arch-Brexiteer Daniel Hannan an author from the rightwing thinktank Civitas suggests abolishing the NHS and BBC as currently financed. You don’t hear Brexiteer ministers confess this vision of wild west, tax-haven capitalism on the Andrew Marr Show. But that’s what drives them on. The EU is just one brake on their heart’s desire – but the greater obstacle by far is the British people: that’s why they never dare test their dreams on the ordinary public.The EU sprang from a social democratic spirit. It is imperfect, often disappointing, but binds us to laudable rights and responsibilities. Forget this week’s government offer of better rights for workers: Brexiteers know they can rip it up if we leave, along with detested health and safety and environmental protection. Any final-say referendum has to expose the Brexiteers’ true intent, to plant the fight where it belongs – for social justice, welfare, working and human rights.That’s why it was so mightily depressing that yet again today Corbyn failed to call a real vote of no confidence in the government, to avoid backing an EU referendum. How bizarre that this most leftwing of leaders ducks the EU confrontation that is the ideological battle of our time. Instead he still echoes May in “respecting” a will of the people that neither he nor anyone else can pretend to know until they are asked. If the Conservative cultists are to be seen off, the true nature of this apparently arcane EU dispute needs to be fought out in the open."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d71f263331546eff4216e5b9c867018a5eb0237/0_119_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22cafa40474ac5b4fb27b418d230c362","title":"the guardian view on the may deal sinking not waving","story":"Theresa May has three objectives. The first is to remain prime minister. The second is to get a parliamentary majority for her withdrawal agreement made with the European Union. The third is to fulfil the first two objectives without splitting the Conservative party. She is unlikely to succeed. The reason rests with the principal opponents in her own party: those Tory MPs who want a second referendum and those who want a hard Brexit. Mrs May wanted both to act in their narrow self-interest rather than cooperating with each other by simultaneously rejecting her agreement. Her line had been that they must choose from among her deal, no deal, or no Brexit. However, the hardline Brexiters did not think her deal was enough to stop another referendum, while the supporters of another referendum in the Tory party did not see her deal as a way to stop the rightwing absolutists getting a no-deal outcome. Significantly, both wings of the Tory party condemned it as “vassalage”. Mrs May’s failure to win either of these factions to her side has been at the root of her parliamentary troubles.Things will not improve with her procrastinations. Instead of peeling off internal opponents, she has hardened opposition. Despite claims to the contrary, Brussels has no reason to throw Mrs May a lifeline. Neither will the Labour party. Mrs May yearns for an opposition that would split in the way Labour did in the fractious politics of the early 1970s when Europe ided the left. If only, the prime minister and her allies thought, there were sizable numbers of Labour rebels – 69 rebelled in 1971 – who would back her on the principle of leaving the EU as the referendum of 2016 mandated. It is a sign of how deluded Mrs May’s team were that they seriously weighed such a rebellion.This country needs to have the vote on the Brexit deal to crystallise where the Commons stands. Late January seems to leave MPs hardly enough time to demonstrate which policy commands the majority or largest minority in parliament. This represents a test for the way the cabinet views the Commons. The riddle of Brexit will not be solved by a series of cabinet leaks which are job applications for prime minister dressed up as serious policy interventions. If the “safety valve” of a parliamentary vote is not opened then Britain’s political system will move inexorably towards an unmanageable level of polarisation, which will render it impossible for the country to manage many basic tasks, let alone implement fresh policies to address emerging social and economic realities. There is a good reason that a no-deal will win very little parliamentary support – it represents too high a price to pay in terms of economic loss for leaving the EU.For much of her time as PM, Mrs May has hidden behind a mask acceptable to the hard Brexiters. It was not until this summer that the mask was removed, allowing the party to see through the disguise: that the trade-offs and compromises would see Britain knocked about by the EU, a global heavyweight that smaller countries or old rivals such as Ireland or France could, in the words of the UK’s former top diplomat in Brussels, Sir Ivan Rogers, “take back control of things you would rather they didn’t” that Britain outside the EU might be a bystander in the setting of policies that would affect voters’ lives that we had not intended to vote in June 2016 to make ourselves poorer, but that is what we are going to be. The penny has dropped. Brexit has been to the Tory party less of a mask that hid – or even subverted – a reality. Instead Brexit is more akin to a political shirt of Nessus, burning anyone who puts it on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dd92eb7d909954634060e20faa4d384c65d10e6/0_315_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2937de9b8a29c42f8cf8387cb724808c","title":"daily mile 15m pounds boost fitness english primary schools","story":"Sport England funding to pay for major expansion of back-to-basics child exercise schemeThe Daily Mile, the back-to-basics fitness initiative for schoolchildren, has received a £1.5m cash injection from Sport England, which hopes to spread the word about it to every primary school in England.The national lottery money represents the biggest expansion of the scheme which began six years ago with children at a primary school in Stirling running five laps round the playing field. It is now a regular fixture at 3,500 schools in England and for 1.25 million children worldwide.The funding will pay for 11 local and two national co-ordinators to bring more of England’s 20,000 primary schools on board, with the aim of helping to improve child fitness and reduce obesity.Elaine Wyllie, the former headteacher of St Ninians in Stirling where the Daily Mile originated, was at Ladypool primary school in Birmingham on Monday to celebrate the new investment by Sport England. “This will put rocket boosters under it,” she said.“It’s absolutely incredible. I can hardly take it in. To have the big tick from Sport England is amazing. They are going to help us roll it out and try and reach every child in England. I’m kind of overwhelmed.”Wyllie, who retired after 40 years as a teacher, began the fitness drive after noticing that children in a year-five class were exhausted after being asked to do a moderate warm up. “I had often thought, why don’t children just run round the field to get fit?”So she started her pupils on a 15-minute run every day – no change of clothes was necessary, no expensive equipment. “Very quickly it became evident they loved it. They were more focused in class, more content, more settled, and looking better. After a month they were keen to keep going.”Sport England became involved after its survey earlier this month revealed that a third of children in England are doing less than 30 minutes of physical activity a day. Children from the poorest families are more likely to be less active.Sport England’s chief executive, Tim Hollingsworth, said: “It’s the strongest evidence yet that not enough is being done to support our youngsters, and change is needed if we’re to increase activity levels.“Through getting schoolchildren to walk or run for 15 minutes every day, the Daily Mile has been proven to significantly improve fitness levels. We want to take the initiative to even more primary schools across the county to improve the health of thousands more children.”The coordinators will sign up schools and help get the scheme up and running, revisiting from time to time to make sure it’s still fresh and fun for the children. The hope is that the return on the £1.5m investment will be children who develop positive attitudes to exercise, so they are more likely to develop healthy active lives into adulthood.Wyllie said she was delighted that more children were going to get the chance to join in and enjoy the benefits. “It’s free – all day and every day. There’s no cost. It’s inclusive of all – girls and boys, children with special educational needs. There are no under-represented groups,” she said.“On that day back in 2012 we stumbled on a partial solution to help children’s physical and mental health and well-being. This is just about children and childhood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48567f43748bf77c17be715319b5a92bc2da7ebe/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07a15f05959d579fb6e5dfa917e5f0f0","title":"carol vorderman and liam gallagher back campaign against trophy hunting","story":"Range of public figures from Jeremy Corbyn to Sue Perkins call for ban on importsA group of public figures including Jeremy Corbyn, Zac Goldsmith, Sue Perkins and Carol Vorderman have joined forces to call for an urgent halt to imports from trophy hunters.In a letter to the , the group, which also includes Piers Morgan, Liam Gallagher, Ed Sheeran and Joanna Lumley, condemns trophy hunting as “cruel, immoral, archaic and unjustifiable”.The letter was written in response to a  report highlighting how hunters are willing to pay thousands of pounds to kill wildlife.  has also reported on how big-game hunters have freely brought almost two tonnes of elephant tusks to the UK from Africa over the past decade.The letter, organised by the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, says: “Unsustainable rates of trophy hunting have caused some populations of Africa’s big cats to decline, while hunting and poaching is outpacing the rate of reproduction of elephants.“We believe that a global end to trophy hunting is desirable, and that nature tourism is a humane and more effective means of conserving wildlife and supporting local communities.

It also reflected the harder miles and tougher battles to come over the next two years if the planet is to remain habitable.Scientist after scientist told the conference that the decisions made by 2020 will determine whether global heating can be kept to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, after which the already apparent dangers of climate instability become far worse.The toughest decisions, however, were pushed into the future, to a special climate summit next September called by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the next two COP conferences – in Chile in December 2019, and then to the country chosen to host in 2020.Katowice showed that the multilateral system of global decision-making is still alive, but under growing threat from fossil fuel interests and the nationalist politicians they fund.Decision-making at the UN is painstakingly difficult at the best of times, because it requires a consensus among 195 nations. In Poland, 14,000 delegates took two weeks to debate the latest science and proposed policy instruments as they whittled down more than 2,800 areas of disagreement.The result was a new global rulebook on emissions that requires nations to report every two years on their progress towardParis agreement commitments to keep temperature rises to between 1.5C and 2C.Several past obstacles were overcome. China accepted standards on transparency, and richer nations – particularly Germany and Norway – put their hands deeper into their pockets to provide more than $100bn (£80bn) to help poorer nations adapt. A renewed ision between the developed and developing world did not materialise as feared.But more fundamental obstructions also came more sharply into focus. The malign role of fossil fuel interests has often been hidden in bureaucratic language or lost in the distractions of diplomatic spats, but in Katowice there were several moments of blinding clarity. Chief among them was the alignment of the world’s top three oil-producing nations – the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia – to downplay scientific warnings about temperature rises beyond 1.5C. Soon after, an ambassador from Australia – a major coal exporter – joined Trump administration officials in a panel that promoted carbon fuels. Brazil also held up talks with a highly contested carbon-accounting proposal that could have reshaped how emissions from the Amazon are calculated.There was also more clarity as a result of the recent protests in France, which prompted policymakers to think twice about the social implications of higher fuel prices. The leading energy economists Nicholas Stern and Ottmar Edenhofer said carbon taxes were still an important instrument to nudge economies away from fossil fuels, but that the transition has to be fair as well as fast, which means using the extra tax revenue for green infrastructure or redistributing it among poorer members of society who are often hardest hit by fuel tax rises.Tensions will grow along with the stakes, as will frustration at the widening gap between the science and politics. More protests and lawsuits can be expected from climate litigation groups, financial estment activists and a growing number of direct action campaigners, including 350.org, Extinction Rebellion and striking students such as Greta Thunberg. They, along with many scientists, say it is not enough to agree on rulebooks. After delaying action for so long, they argue the world now needs leaps rather than steps.It would be fitting if the UK won the right to host the crucial climate summit in 2020. Done well, it would showcase how the world’s first industrialised nation is shifting away from carbon faster than almost any other.

Sales rose at the main Victoria Beckham ready-to-wear range, which this year celebrated its 10th anniversary with its first show at London fashion week, as well as accessories and eyewear.The company raised £30m a year ago from NEO Investment Partners, which has also backed the British designer Tom Dixon, the French bakery Paul and the Italian leather goods firm Valextra.Against a difficult trading environment this year, VBL said it had been “investing for future growth and building its senior leadership team”.A statement said shareholders were committed to helping the brand break even in the medium term by cutting costs as well as driving growth.Since NEO came on board the company has appointed Paolo Riva, a former boss of Diane von Furstenberg, as chief executive alongside the chairman, Ralph Toledano, a fashion industry veteran who brought the designer Phoebe Philo to Chloé.Riva, who joined in September, said: “We will continue to invest in growth markets such as the US and Asia whilst also ensuring we have the right strategy to ensure profitability over the medium term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1654120df56832ea8725eaa846470ebccc4935c1/0_9_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4b680d13347c5ca14e1e96170208249","title":"vice review christian bale dick cheney biopic","story":"Bale brilliantly captures the former vice-president’s bland magnificence in Adam McKay’s entertainingly nihilist biopicThe former US vice-president, big oil nabob and waterboarding enthusiast Dick Cheney squats like a latex, inflated toad at the ear of power in this flashy political comedy from Adam McKay. Or perhaps it’s truer to say that it’s at Cheney’s massive ear where notional power squats in the form of former president George W Bush. This is due to a terrifically and in fact rather scarily plausible impersonation from Christian Bale, whose head has been enlarged to the size of a pale-pink bespectacled beach ball atop a shapeless, conservatively suited fleshmound.Vice is always entertaining and nihilist, especially when it comes to Cheney’s relationship with his beloved daughter Mary Cheney (Alison Pill), an out gay woman and same-sex marriage campaigner. Cheney’s final treatment of her in this movie made me think of Citizen Kane setting fire to his childhood sled and saying he never liked winter-sports equipment named after flowers anyway. This film has had a surge of awards season love. Could it be that there is a surge of liberal nostalgia for a time when Republican bad guys, however horrible, were at least smart and rational people who had the good taste to stay out of the limelight personally, and you sort of knew where you stood with them?Vice is a kind of PowerPoint biopic, a Ted talk of a comedy, with fourth-wall breaks and voiceover routines borrowed from Michael Moore. But the stylised inserts reminded me a bit more worryingly of his previous film, the bafflingly overrated The Big Short from 2015, a pseudo-satire of the financial world that tried to confer underdog-hero status on those money men who’d done well out of the crash.McKay’s wacky structural alienation-effects and meta gags are more pertinent here, and the dialogue is far more smoothly managed: there is a nice fantasy scene in which Cheney and his formidable wife Lynne (played by Amy Adams) switch into Shakespearean dialogue, as a comment on the laconic, tongue-tied nature of real life. (If Aaron Sorkin had been writing this, Dick, Lynne and everyone would else would be jabbering away non-stop in smart alec-speak.) There is also a neat twist involving the voiceover narrator.Basically, it’s a better film than The Big Short because of a big, enjoyable, intelligent central performance in which Bale has the sense to do more with less. His Cheney is often slumped, immobile, round-shouldered, animated only when reaching for a confidential document or sugary pastry. But he’s a quick mover, politically.Bale shows his man’s simple personal evolution. As a young boozer and Yale dropout from Wyoming, Dick gets an almighty, blazing-eyed telling-off from Lynne, and he resolves to straighten up and fly right. Quitting booze entirely isn’t what happens, but his passions are transferred to food and power, and he graduates to a paunch-plus-combover in his days in the Nixon White House, working for Donald Rumsfeld, who is played by Steve Carell as a grinning, self-congratulatory reactionary – but interestingly far less powerful and important than we thought him at the time.And then Cheney becomes the great big plutocrat blob that America came to not particularly know or love. He was secretary for defense under the late George HW Bush. Then, during the exile years of the Clinton presidency, he was CEO of energy giant Halliburton, before the naive young Dubya called him back as vice-president – a job he effectively reconfigured as power behind the throne, and in front of it.Bale’s bland self-possession is very funny, especially when he suffers a heart attack in the middle of a speech as a young, would-be congressman – and he has been so mumbling, sweaty and incoherent that it isn’t obvious he has gone into cardiac arrest until he comes off stage and says he needs an ambulance. Later he will stand, shrug, frown and announce that once again he needs to go to hospital.And how does it all relate to the New Trump Order? Well, McKay puts in a post-credits sting on this topic, and it is possible that the cynicism and rapaciousness of the Cheney era paved the way to what America has now. The film shows Cheney telling Senator Patrick Leahy to go fuck himself – considered a watershed for vulgarity at the time.But Cheney was a quiet man. As he says when he brings Rumsfeld back into the Bush Jr White House, it is a quiet place: “We have conservative TV and radio to do our yelling for us.” Now the yelling has been brought back into politics it is politics. Cheney can hardly be surprised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03f74610a9c9452d13a2979ef7496a72cf3a35b2/0_81_4484_2690/master/4484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44ae61a1729fcb451ef525cd5b24db11","title":"the quest for a perfect panettone","story":"The thrice-risen Italian favourite is now a seasonal staple in the UK. But can new fanciful flavours beat the golden, fruit-studded classic?Once an exotic Christmas treat found only in Italian delis, panettone is now a seasonal staple – so hardly a fad. In Italy, it is a time-honoured Christmas favourite. Panettone – possibly derived from pane di Tonio (Tony’s bread) – is said to be the result of panic when a medieval court chef (the eponymous Tony) had nothing to serve for dessert, so he invented this deceptively light, thrice-risen dough laced with abundant egg yolk, even more butter, marsala-soaked sultanas and peel.To this day, no Italian home is complete without a golden crown of panettone on the go throughout the festive period, usually enjoyed au naturelle – with coffee, maybe something stronger – or perhaps as the key ingredient in an indulgent bread pudding, or Antonio Carluccio’s pasticchio di Babbo Natale (Santa Claus’s pudding), a simple but delicious concoction of panettone, vin santo, peel and cream.In the UK, panettone sales have never been healthier, with supermarkets reporting a rise year-on-year, while Selfridges says it outsold Christmas pudding by two to one in 2017. And so, Christmas being an annual orgy of gluttony and commercial opportunity, it follows that anyone who is anyone in retail has remixed the classic panettone into a probably-wrong-but-somehow-alluring duet with another, unnecessary flavour profile. Witness Heston for Waitrose’s black forest panettone, Sainsbury’s prosecco panettone, Tesco’s orange liqueur and chocolate panettone … all of which make me feel as I did when Blue covered Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word: yes, I sang along, probably quite enthusiastically, but was it Elton?Having spent three days last winter in Turin – the very heart of panettone-land, and in the season for it, too – I have little time for anything hinting at a dry crumb. The inside of a panettone should be like a moist, golden, fruit-studded pillow, rippable from the round in elegant strands resembling angels’ wings. It seems to me that texture is panettone’s most vital quality, more important even than flavour. Style over substance here is a glaring error.

Although City’s director of football said all the right things about Schalke representing a difficult hurdle to his side’s prospects of progressing to the last eight in the competition they covet most, a meeting with the team who are currently 13th in the Bundesliga is unlikely to raise much concern in the corridors of power at the Etihad Stadium. Domenico Tedesco’s side finished five points behind Porto in a weak group and have lost eight times in the league this season, although Pep Guardiola will not underestimate their threat even if he did not lose to them in six meetings as Bayern Munich manager. The former Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentaleb and Switzerland striker Breel Embolo are potential danger men as Leroy Sané returns to his former club for the first time since joining City in 2016.Players to watch: Breel Embolo (Schalke) David Silva (Manchester City)Juventus finished ahead of Manchester United in their group but will be wary of facing Diego Simeone’s side as Cristiano Ronaldo makes his first return to Madrid since leaving their bitter rivals in the summer. Atlético’s Wanda politano will host the final on 1 June, perhaps making them an even tougher nut to crack than usual in a competition in which they have finished as runners-up three times. In nine home matches this season, Atlético have conceded only five goals but showed a new vulnerability on the road in the 4-0 thrashing by Borussia Dortmund during the group stage that denied them top spot. Juventus remain one of the favourites and with Ronaldo in their ranks should have just enough firepower to find a way through Simeone’s miserly defence, led by Jan Oblak and Diego Godín.Players to watch: Antoine Griezmann (Atlético) Cristiano Ronaldo (Juventus)Less than 24 hours after a costly defeat at Anfield, this was the draw José Mourinho was probably expecting. Thomas Tuchel’s PSG racked up 17 goals during the group stages after a slow start and are already approaching half a century in Ligue 1 having played 16 matches, meaning Manchester United’s manager will need to call on his vast Champions League experience to get through this tie against Neymar, Kylian Mbappé and co. November’s dramatic victory against Juventus in Turin could give him a glimmer of hope of emulating David Moyes in 2014 by reaching the last eight while struggling in the Premier League, although you have to fear for United’s defence given recent displays. The question is whether Mourinho will still be in charge for the first leg at Old Trafford on 12 February.Players to watch: Anthony Martial (Manchester United) Neymar (PSG)Mauricio Pochettino’s side beat Dortmund twice in the group stages in 2017 but Lucien Favre’s side are a different prospect these days. Nine points clear in the Bundesliga and yet to taste defeat in 15 matches, they will be formidable opponents as they attempt to put last season’s disappointing defeat by Juventus at this stage behind them. The England forward Jadon Sancho has emerged as a major talent in Dortmund’s vibrant young team, with the 18-year-old having contributed five goals and seven assists this campaign in the league. The German side are led by a resurgent Marco Reus, have the super-sub Paco Alcácer and boast a defence which has conceded only 15 goals in the league. Spurs will need to show more of the fighting spirit they summoned in squeezing through their group if they are to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 2011.Players to watch: Christian Eriksen (Tottenham) Marco Reus (Borussia Dortmund)The French side have reached this stage for the first time since 2012 and showed they are not here to make up the numbers by winning at Manchester City in the group stage before the 2-2 draw last month. The captain Nabil Fekir has excelled after his transfer to Liverpool collapsed, although they are 13 points behind a rampant PSG in Ligue 1 and have proved inconsistent. Barcelona are still smarting from their quarter-final embarrassment at the hands of Roma last season and Ernesto Valverde’s side will be expected to progress without too much fuss. Two goals from Thierry Henry in a 5-2 thrashing at the Camp Nou at this stage set Pep Guardiola’s side on course for their third title in 2009 and they will fancy their chances of going all the way again this year.Players to watch: Nabil Fekir (Lyon) Lionel Messi (Barcelona)Last year’s semi-finalists finished behind Real Madrid in the group stages, with Roma’s young side struggling down in sixth place in Serie A. Eusebio Di Francesco has been under pressure in recent weeks but will hope that he can survive the winter months to lead his side into what looks a great opportunity to reach the last eight. Porto dropped only two points on their way to topping an admittedly weak Group D and have a narrow lead in the Portuguese league under manager Sérgio Conceição, perhaps making them slight favourites to progress in a competition they have won on two previous occasions. But Roma’s experience at this level could tip the balance in their favour if they can resolve their domestic issues.Players to watch: Cengiz Ünder (Roma) Moussa Marega (Porto)A repeat of the semi-final in 1973 that saw Johan Cruyff’s side win 3-1 on aggregate on their way to the second of three European Cups in succession, the next meeting of these two famous clubs will be a mouthwatering prospect that pits Erik ten Hag’s exciting young side against the reigning champions. Real Madrid have not lost a knockout tie in the Champions League since their defeat by Juventus at the semi-final stage in 2015 but have struggled in the wake of Zinedine Zidane’s departure in the summer and were embarrassed at home by CSKA Moscow last week. They remain favourites but the energy and pace of Ajax’s midfield and attack led by the new generation of homegrown talent will provide a stiff test for the 13-time winners.Players to watch: Frenkie De Jong (Ajax) Marco Asensio (Real Madrid)A meeting with the perennial German champions may not be the daunting prospect it used to be but Bayern will nonetheless provide a tough obstacle to Liverpool’s hopes of progressing. Ajax were the latest opponents to expose their defensive frailties under manager Niko Kovac in the thrilling 3-3 draw last week, with several of their established stars struggling to find the consistency they have become known for over the years. Jürgen Klopp won only nine of his 29 matches against Bayern as manager of Mainz and Borussia Dortmund and will be keen to make up for the latter’s defeat in the 2013 final. He will be without the suspended Virgil van Dijk for the first leg at Anfield on 19 February yet should be confident that the Premier League leaders can repeat their feat of beating Bayern in the 1981 semi-final.Players to watch: Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) Arjen Robben (Bayern Munich)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b612d0fc67138b5dfd4c73819e9c9649a19bfe7b/0_143_3404_2042/master/3404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0525c8ecd69f7f89057ab9e350e640e9","title":"finally got real life title race manchester city liverpool","story":"There was something telling about the roar around Anfield at the end of Sunday’s expertly enacted strangulation of Manchester United. As the referee blew his whistle the players caught their breath or wandered across to shake hands. The noise from the stands was warm and sustained – but also unintentionally damning.Liverpool had just played Manchester United off the park, all the way down Anfield Road, past Knotty Ash and back on to the M62. But this wasn’t a moment of triumphalism, or of glorying in the moment. It was applause with half an eye on something else, already looking towards the door, pleasure in another staging point ticked off.Nothing chills quite like indifference and this was the real lesson of the weekend. Beating this Manchester United, while clearly fun and pointed and storied with historic grudge material, is simply a means to an end for Jürgen Klopp’s team.Which is good news for the rest of us. With the festive fixture glut approaching we can now say it for certain. Welcome, Premier League watchers, to an actual, real-life title race.Yes, we’ve finally got there, five years on from the last one. The league has, of course, produced wonderful teams in that time, and at least one startling story. But an actual, down-to-the-wire, adrenaline-powered title race has been lacking. And the product cannot be seen to be lacking, to appear a little oversold or reliant on noise and subplots and star names.If this seems overly hopeful given there are still 21 games to play, then consider where the league has been at the same stage in recent years. Last season Manchester City were 11 points clear of second-placed Manchester United with 17 games gone. The year before Chelsea were six points clear of Liverpool. Three seasons ago Leicester were only two points clear but then struck out in January and cruised clear for the final 15 games.Whereas this time around the season has finally thrown up two teams hitting their stride at the same moment, both with points tallies that would have them out on their own in almost any other year. Even Spurs, third on 39 points, would have been top at this stage the year Leicester won the league and top the season before too, the year of we-don’t-let-this-slip and all that.Where to from here? For Tottenham a serious run at the top will require a sustained winning streak and a stumble from both of the hares. Unlikely, perhaps, but there is hope. After the trip to Everton next weekend Mauricio Pochettino’s men have a run of nine winnable games before Chelsea and Arsenal loom into view.Teams such as Wolves, Watford, Bournemouth and Manchester United are not to be underestimated. But the fact is there are 27 quite gettable points available in that period through to spring. During which Liverpool face a tougher run, with trips to the Etihad, Old Trafford and Goodison.City’s run to the start of March is also a little harder, with Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea to play at home. At the end of which, viewing through the most flattering neutral’s filter, it is possible we could have something close to a three-way jam leading into the final third of the season.Distractions and noises-off look evenly spread out. All three chasing clubs are in the Champions League last 16. The shifting of the Africa Cup of Nations to June has removed another point of friction.City have more to benefit in terms of players returning from injury, with the best midfielder in the country, Kevin De Bruyne, only now brushing off the cobwebs. Spurs have the thinnest squad of the three and will be vulnerable to the ravages of the season. On Sunday Liverpool could afford to save Xherdan Shaqiri for the final 20 minutes, the perfect change of texture as the game became ever more clogged in tight spaces, ideal for the fine-point explosive skills of Anfield’s own Power Cube.But it is Liverpool’s defensive muscle that really marks out their title challenge, not to mention a point of agreeable contrast between the league’s top two. Virgil van Dijk is clearly the best one-on-one defender in the league, a player so calm at times you can feel both teams taking directions from him, the game’s designated head prefect.Klopp will also take defensive comfort from the immense performance at Anfield of Fabinho, who covered brilliantly but was also able to provide that delicate lofted pass for the opening goal, the kind of pass that reminds you, even when the word has lost its lustre, that even a grizzled Brazilian midfield shield is still a Brazilian.That resilience and defensive physicality are a slight departure from last season. But it is also a counterpoint to City’s more chancy, feather-footed movements, football that seems almost pigheadedly light and airy, a style that is relentlessly luminous on a point of dogged principle.It is a contrast that will present itself in the flesh two and half weeks from now when the champions entertain the current league leaders. If the cheers at Anfield on Sunday sounded standard issue, ungripped by obvious hysteria, it seems certain both sides will see the Etihad on 3 January as a far more urgent date.There have already been signs of a little interesting evolution towards that date. It will, for example be fascinating to see how City respond to Liverpool’s fondness for rapid diagonal transitions down both flanks, the same kind of move that saw Chelsea expose the City full-backs’ vertiginous wanderlust at Stamford Bridge.For now we can simply be happy with that rare thing something that even in the most violently stratified league looks like old-fashioned robust sporting competition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90157fec648ecaa3746320f8918b2f8615a3973b/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b6b3f1b0d4b80484e92adfe626b5ff3","title":"how the guardian ranked the 100 best male footballers in the world 2018","story":"Mario Kempes, Zico and Nuno Gomes were part of a 225-strong voting panel as we compiled our list of the best male footballers on the planetFor our seventh male top 100 list we have assembled a voting panel of 225 judges from 69 countries, led by legendary players such as Zico, Mario Kempes and Nuno Gomes.They are backed up by a global selection of coaches, broadcasters, reporters, correspondents and editors, as well as other former players such as Javier Zanetti, Tugay Kerimoglu and Eyal Berkovic.The 34 current and former professionals have won a combined total of 1,909 international caps.Our 225 judges are drawn from around the world as follows: Africa 19, Asia 20, Europe 140, North and Central America 11, South America 35.The countdown begins on Tuesday 18 December with Nos 100-71.

How do you give someone a maid-a-milking? And what are mince pies?The short answer is that it’s a Christian festival that celebrates the birth of Jesus.According to the nativity story, Mary and Joseph travelled from their home in Nazareth (in what is now Israel) to Bethlehem (in what is now the West Bank) to take part in a census. Months earlier, Mary had been visited by the Angel Gabriel and told she would give birth to a boy who she would name Jesus, and who would be the son of God. The child was delivered in a stable. Shepherds and wise men brought birthday gifts.The bible does not specify the date of Jesus’s birth. Some people have suggested it was in the spring because of the custom of sending sheep into the fields at that time of year. “And in the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields, and keeping watch over their flock by night.” (Luke 2:8)In the fourth century, Pope Julius I chose 25 December as the date of the Feast of the Nativity. It took a while to catch on: Christmas wasn’t celebrated in England until the end of the sixth century, didn’t reach northern Europe until the end of the eighth century, and Christmas Day didn’t become a federal holiday in the US until 1870.25 December is the day that the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches celebrate Christmas, but many Orthodox Christians use the Julian calendar, which runs 13 days behind the standard international Gregorian calendar, for religious festivals. Christmas is celebrated by Orthodox Christians on 7 January in Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, Belarus, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Moldova and Montenegro.Not as a festival to celebrate the nativity, obviously. But the reason why Pope Julius I picked 25 December was to appropriate pagan midwinter festivals and transform them into a Christian occasion.In Scandinavia, the Norse celebrated ‘Jul’ (Yule) from the winter solstice (21 December) for as long as it took for large logs to burn out, usually about 12 days. There was plenty of meat as animals were slaughtered so they wouldn’t need feeding over the winter, and home-brewed wine and beer was ready for drinking at Yuletide.In Rome, Saturnalia – honouring Saturn, the god of agriculture – began just before the winter solstice and continued for seven days. Men dressed as women, masters dressed as servants, and there was much feasting and rowdy behaviour.In the British Isles, druids cut and blessed mistletoe to mark the winter solstice.Not quite. When Oliver Cromwell and his Puritan forces took over England, Christmas was banned. Noting that the date of Jesus’s birth is not in the Bible, the Puritans decided it was all a just a pseudo-Christian gloss for the earlier pagan festivals. In 1644, Christmas was outlawed – no decorations, no mince pies and definitely no decadence. An “Ordinance for Abolishing of Festivals” was passed by parliament in June 1647 banning Christmas, Easter and Whitsun. In the US, where the Puritans were even more, well, puritan, anyone showing a bit of Christmas spirit in Boston faced a hefty fine of five shillings. Some referred to Christmas as “Foolstide”.Along with the monarchy, the festival was soon restored, and it was the Victorians who really shaped Christmas as we know it today. They instituted carol singing, decorated trees and the exchange of cards. The first Christmas tree was brought from Germany by Prince Albert to the royal household in the 1840s. These days, about 7m real trees are sold in the UK each year, and as many as 30m in the US.One in six people say it takes up to a whole year to pay off the cost of their Christmas splurge, and then the pressure to spend begins piling up again from about mid-October onwards.Perhaps, but Christmas is also a boom time for churches, with many people attending a service over the holiday even if they don’t consider themselves to be believers. Even some hardened atheists find candle-lit midnight mass on Christmas Eve or a children’s nativity service hard to resist.This year the C of E has launched a digital campaign, #FollowTheStar, inviting people to visit their local church over Christmas.Rather then being resentful of a Christian festival, Muslims often commit to extra charity work over the Christmas period, and some mosques hold special lectures about Jesus, considered in Islam to be a prophet. The festival of Eid al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, is sometimes called (by non-Muslims) the Muslim equivalent of Christmas in as far as it is a time spent with family and gifts are exchanged. The next time Eid al-Fitr and Christmas coincide is 2033.The phrase “Happy Holidays” has become commonplace as a catch-all for Christmas, Hanukkah (the Jewish festival which falls close to Christmas), and the non-religious. “Chrismukkah” interfaith greeting cards are available for those who want to mark both.And for those who simply don’t want any part of any festivities, there is always the tax return. More than 2,500 people filled in HMRC online self-assessment forms on Christmas Day last year.Not quite. There’s little real evidence of opposition to Christmas as a festival, but there have been many ill-founded media stories about the “war on Christmas”.The most famous centres on a promotional campaign run over three months by Birmingham city council in 1997-98, called Winterval. It covered Hallowe’en, Bonfire Night, Diwali, Ramadan, Eid, Hanukkah, Advent, Christmas, Boxing Day, New Year’s Eve and Chinese New Year.The council was accused of “political correctness gone mad”, even though it hoisted a “Merry Christmas” banner across the town hall, put up Christmas trees in city squares, hosted carol-singing sessions, and the Lord Mayor sent out a card depicting a traditional Christmas scene and wishing recipients a Merry Christmas.A few years later, Luton borough council was accused of “cancelling Christmas” in order not to offend Muslims. Critics wrongly claimed the council leader had tried to substitute a Harry Potter festival called Luminos for a proper Christian Christmas. In fact, the council’s Luminos festival had taken place over a November weekend three years before the row broke out.Not quite. After Christmas Day comes Boxing Day, a public holiday in the UK, also known as St Stephen’s Day. The name refers to a Christmas box traditionally given to servants and tradespeople, containing money, a gift and sometimes leftover food. It used to be a big fox-hunting day and is filled with top sporting fixtures, but mainly it signals the start of the post-Christmas sales for those with any money left over.And it doesn’t end there. In theory, the Christmas festival lasts 12 days, until 6 January, the day when the three wise men turned up in Bethlehem with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh for baby Jesus. Traditionally, the celebrations continue and the decorations remain in place until 12th night, also known as Epiphany.The song The 12 Days of Christmas, which started life as an 18th century rhyme before being set to music by Frederic Austin in 1909, logs all the gifts given to the singer by his or her true love, ranging from a partridge in a pear tree to 12 drummers drumming. One financial services group estimates the cost of the gifts this year at more than £30,000.It’s not clear. You can’t call them maids any more, and most milking is done by machine.Easter! This is the Christian festival marking the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. The gap between Christmas and Easter varies between three and four months, and this time it’s on the outer edge of that range with Easter falling on the third weekend of April. Or, for the resolutely non-Christian, there’s the spring equinox on 21 March. Until then, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays …• This article was amended on 17 December 2018 to clarify the time when Prince Albert is credited with bringing the first Christmas tree from Germany into the royal household."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b141740281a242aec8439d6ae263274922bb05b/0_757_7192_4316/master/7192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6272ceff28356457b2827b652ecabdb","title":"cardi b offset stage rolling loud","story":"Fans accuse Offset of manipulation after rapper makes unscheduled appearance on stage at Rolling LoudWhen rapper Offset made an unscheduled appearance during Saturday’s Rolling Loud festival to beg his estranged wife Cardi B for forgiveness, fans were stunned. More than 24 hours later, a debate is still unfolding on social media, often pitting celebrities against her fans.Cardi B looked displeased at the sight of Offset handing her a bouquet of roses spelling out “Take me back, Cardi” and appeared to yell at him before requesting the lights be shut off. After she had the flowers – and her ex – ushered off the stage, she continued with her set. Cardi was the first woman to headline Rolling Loud in its four-year history.Offset’s apology, some fans said, was toxic and many pointed to a pattern of public apologies as a manipulation tactic. Many Cardi B fans believe the stunt overshadowed her big moment as a headline act and called Offset selfish for crashing the stage.While the majority of her fans sided with her and urged her to stand her ground, some male rappers have supported Offset. 50 Cent commented on Instagram: “Go back to that man, he loves you”. The Game posted a video in which he said: “I really feel like you need to get back together. Y’all a family unit … Y’all can’t break up.”Other celebrities, like TI and comedian Lil Duval, have lent their voices to defend Offset. John Mayer has also come out in support of Cardi taking Offset back – yet said that he did not know him.The split happened after leaked messages showed Offset apparently planning an affair. In attempting to justify his on-stage apology, Offset tweeted: “All my wrongs have been made public, I figure it’s only right that my apologies are made public too.”Shortly after, Cardi B posted on Instagram that she and Offset were no longer together. In a now-deleted video, she said: “I’ve been trying to working things out with my baby father for a minute … We’re really good friends … We’ve got a lot of love for each other but things haven’t been working out between us for a long time.”Cardi and Offset married last year and have a daughter together. Offset maintains he did not cheat but admits he was “entertaining” the idea.Offset’s gesture has opened a debate around the pressure felt by celebrities, their peers and social media. Some fans have said Offset has continued to blame others for his infidelity and that Cardi is shouldering the consequences. Twitter user Sonia Ladd commented: “Cardi B should not have to apologise to Offset nor should she be labelled as ‘heartless’ or ‘selfish.’ Women are constantly framed as the bad ones when we remove ourself from a relationship which is toxic or a situation in which we’re mistreated, under-appreciated and disrespected.”Others are pointing to the culture of hip-hop as being a breeding ground for the normalization of toxic behavior where men are rarely held accountable. If the roles were reversed, they ask, and Cardi B was the one who planned to cheat on him, would there be a call to forgive and forget?This is not the first attempt at a public apology since the announcement of the pair’s separation. Shortly after the announcement, Offset tweeted, in part: “I miss Cardi.” On Friday, he took to the stage with rapper 21 Savage, who led the crowd with the chant “Cardi, Take Offset Back!” Offset has also begged for Cardi’s forgiveness on Instagram, requesting that he spend the holidays and the rest of his life with Cardi and their child.Cardi B has recently been in the news. She was involved in a clash with Nicki Minaj at a Harper’s Bazaar party and a fight at a Queens strip club with two female bartenders. She is currently facing misdemeanor charges.Despite these personal setbacks, she was recently nominated for five Grammys including album of the year, best rap album and record of the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cd7efe9aed20faed1df00ad5a3e795e2b025e50/0_204_4205_2524/master/4205.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e3c02169e6262f2fc978a16e10dfe66","title":"english national opera to give under 18s free saturday night tickets","story":"Company announces ‘seismic’ initiative to lure next generation of customersEnglish National Opera is to offer under-18s free Saturday night tickets in what it has called a “seismic” initiative to attract the next generation of fans.Trying to encourage young people to opera, convincing them that it could be for them and is not elitist, is an issue which occupies minds at opera houses across the world. On Monday the ENO announced one solution: remove the cost.Stuart Murphy, the former channel controller of the youth channel BBC Three who joined ENO as CEO in March, said the initiative stemmed from the company’s core values.“We were founded on the belief that opera is for everyone,” he said. “Removing cost as a barrier to entry for under-18s is a seismic leap forward for ENO and for opera as a whole.”Murphy said the company hoped to entice as many young people as possible, “from the musically obsessed, to the just plain curious”. He added: “ENO is founded on passion and we want young audiences to feel alternately passionate, excited and transfixed. We can’t wait to welcome them to the London Coliseum.”All the free tickets will be for what might be called the cheap seats in the balcony. But ENO contends the balcony “is widely regarded as having acoustically the best seats in the house”. There will also be no peering round columns as, uniquely, all seats at the Coliseum have unrestricted views of the stage.Anyone who is under 16 will need to be accompanied by an adult. But any adult who purchases a full-price ticket in the balcony, typically £12, £20 or £35, will be able to take up to four children for free. Teachers bringing a school group can be accompanied by 10 children for free. Young people aged 16-17 can book one ticket each.The tickets will be available for all of the 11 Saturday performances in the spring 2019 season, which includes productions of La Bohème, Akhnaten, The Merry Widow, The Magic Flute, and the new opera Jack the Ripper: the Women of Whitechapel.The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, welcomed the offer. “The arts can be transformative for young people and no genre should be deemed too elite or out of reach,” he said. “This scheme is an excellent way to introduce more young people to opera and will ensure that people of all ages and backgrounds can experience world-class performances at English National Opera.”Engaging with young people is a priority of all arts organisations, with a variety of initiatives across the sector.For example, this year Tate announced a £5 ticket scheme for 16-to-25-year-olds to increase, it hopes, the number of young people going to ticketed exhibitions. The National Theatre offers half-price tickets to under-18s during the week and for all matinees, while the Royal Shakespeare Company has a BP-sponsored £5 ticket scheme for 16-to-25-year-olds.The ENO initiative will be welcomed by those who argue that the best way to get young people hooked is for them to experience the art form itself.Graham Vick, the artistic director of Birmingham Opera Company, has described conventional outreach and education work as a “barrier” to reaching new audiences. “You do not need to be educated to be touched, to be moved and excited by opera,” he said. “You only need to experience it directly at first hand with nothing getting in the way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f69364055f7f47fb98eb4c951402a70b461960ea/380_642_5469_3281/master/5469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1d9cab51c4de30c7302f806a6951db4","title":"a great day in harlem behind art kaness classic 1958 jazz photograph","story":"The young art director’s idea to photograph as many of the luminaries of the New York jazz scene as possible together for Esquire’s 1959 Golden Age of Jazz edition began his career as a photographer.

Some experts have dismissed the idea as illusory.Ahead of Tuesday’s cabinet meeting to discuss a no-deal scenario, here is what we know about where ministers stand:The prime minister has been sticking to her insistence she can extract new concessions from the EU and force her plan through the Commons. Her ministers might need to persuade her otherwise.May’s de facto deputy has always been publicly on message. The Labour MP Chris Bryant has suggested he has discussed the possibility of a second referendum with him, something Lidington denied. But he has been known to oppose no deal.The chancellor has been very much against the idea of a no-deal departure, even as he distributes funds to prepare for it, but has not said whether he supports more options for MPs.The home secretary, who has been widely assumed to harbour leadership ambitions, was reported to be one of the ministers pushing for serious consideration of a no-deal exit.The foreign secretary, a remainer-turned die hard Brexiter, used an interview on Sunday to talk up the benefits of leaving without a deal.The Brexit secretary, while a definite leave-minded Tory, is so new to the cabinet that it has been hard for him to agitate one way or the other.The defence secretary has been another minister reported to be in the group backing a “managed no deal”.The justice secretary has been vehemently against the no-deal option, and has suggested he could quit the cabinet if this was being mooted.Hancock, as health secretary, has been central to telling ministers about the risks of no deal in areas such as medicine supplies. He has suggested a second referendum could happen, though he opposes the idea.The business secretary has publicly backed the idea of asking MPs for a solution, saying the Commons should “be invited to say what it would agree with”.The international trade secretary, while a long-time Brexiter, said on Sunday he “wouldn’t have a huge problem with parliament as a whole having a say on what the options were”.The work and pensions secretary another vehement opponent of no deal, was one of the first ministers to discuss alternative ideas if May’s plan was voted down.On Sunday the education secretary hinted he backed allowing MPs to discuss other plans, saying there would be “a value in, sort of, flushing out what these various different options are”.The environment secretary, while he was among the leading leave campaigners in the referendum, has been supportive of May, and has been reportedly worried at the idea of no deal.The international development secretary has been reportedly at the head of plans to push for a no deal, and was allegedly in talks with the MPs from the hard Brexit-backing European Research Group.The communities secretary, a cautious loyalist of May’s, has yet to say what alternative plan he might back.The transport secretary, who was May’s campaign manager when she became Tory leader, would stick to whatever plan the PM proposes.While the Scottish secretary expressed alarm over elements of May’s plan, he has also said that no deal would be disastrous for Scotland.The Welsh secretary also had doubts about May’s plan but has not expressed a strong view on the next step.The Northern Ireland secretary has repeatedly expressed worries about a no deal, saying it would inevitably lead to customs checks on the Irish border.The culture secretary has so far been steadfastly loyal to May’s deal, and has not indicated what alternative plan he might support.The Conservative party chair would stick to the official line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df520270a01d3b8b2f4415e53bc96d5b442dd15/0_221_4862_2916/master/4862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b19d95412f529184b19abc7becd75924","title":"brexit latest theresa may commons statement greg clark backs cabinet calls for mps to be asked to vote on options if mays deal defeated politics live","story":"Labour leader tables motion saying the house has no confidence in the PM because of failure to hold a meaningful vote immediatelyA the heart of the somewhat disorientating spectacle in Westminster this evening is this relatively straightforward fact: The official opposition, Labour, can call a binding confidence vote in the government that, if won, would lead to a general election (provided no government commanding the confidence of the House was formed within two weeks).Corbyn decided not to do so, but to table a non-binding motion of no confidence in the prime minister, which is not the form of words explicitly called for by the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act and does not force the government to allot any parliamentary time.Labour has attempted to engage in a game of brinkmanship with the prime minister, saying that refusing to hold the vote would show May is running scared. Behind this is, perhaps, the calculation that enough of those who have declared themselves dissatisfied with May’s leadership would take the bait and back Corbyn’s motion.Key players, however, have lined up behind the prime minister and it is now the government telling Corbyn he is running scared of a full no-confidence vote.Where Westminster goes from here is unclear.Since Jeremy Corbyn tabled his motion, there have been conflicting reports about whether or not the government will agree to allot time in the parliamentary schedule.As we noted earlier, support for the prime minister was explicitly forthcoming from her own hard Brexit-supporting backbenchers and her restive confidence and supply partner, the DUP, making it unlikely Corbyn would win (you can read more about that here).That led some to speculate that Theresa May would allow Corbyn’s vote to go ahead because she was confident she would win it – that was certainly the line being briefed to the Daily  shortly after Corbyn’s motion was tabled.That was led credence by the fact that some Labour MPs appeared to have been given a similar impression:Soon, though, other sources began briefing the opposite:Later in the evening, a Downing Street source said the government would set aside no parliamentary time for a vote.We won’t allow time for what is a stunt. The FTPA (Fixed-Term Parliaments Act) applies if Labour wants to put down a motion under the terms of that.In short, what that meant was that, if Corbyn felt he could win a binding vote of no confidence in the government as a whole, rather than a non-binding one in the prime minister herself, then – as far as the government is concerned – he is free to table one on Tuesday.Indeed, at the last opportunity on Monday, as Parliament was rising for the night, other opposition parties announced they had submitted an amendment they believed would turn Corbyn’s motion into such a formal vote.However, that was not initially thought to be binding because, by convention, votes of no confidence that have to be debated the next day have to be submitted by the leader of the opposition, in this case Corbyn, as well as using the specified form of words. A Labour source is playing down the move as a non-starter.This a specious argument (it’s like a rookie election candidate challenging the sitting MP in a safe seat to a debate, and then claiming the MP is running “running scared” when she says no) but it is probably the best available to Labour in the circumstances. Earlier the party briefed that Corbyn was going to issue this threat in his statement responding to May after 3.30pm, not at the end of the session as a point of order. At the time Corbyn appeared to have dropped the move in response to May announcing in her opening statement that the vote would take place in the week beginning Monday 14 January - a non-concession (see 5pm) that Labour claimed as a victory.That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.This is what Jeremy Corbyn said in his point of order at the end of Theresa May’s statement.It’s very clear that it’s bad, unacceptable that we should be waiting almost a month before we have a meaningful vote on the crucial issue facing the future of this country. The prime minister has obdurately refused to ensure a vote took place on the date she agreed, she refuses to allow a vote to take place this week and is now, I assume, thinking the vote will be on January 14 - almost a month away. This is unacceptable in any way whatsoever. So, as the only way I can think of ensuring a vote takes place this week, I’m about to table a motion which says the following: ‘That this House has no confidence in the prime minister due to her failure to allow the House of Commons to have a meaningful vote straight away on the withdrawal agreement and framework for future relationships between the UK and European Union.’That will be tabled immediately, Mr Speaker.Andy Bell from 5 News says no one told John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, that Labour had changed its mind on the no confidence motion.The statement is now over. Jeremy Corbyn rises to make a point of order. He says putting off the vote until January is unacceptable. He says he will table a motion saying the House has no confidence in the PM because of May’s failure to hold a meaningful vote immediately.So we are back were we were just before 3.30pm.It is no clearer now than it was then whether this is a motion that will actually be put to a vote. (See 3.12pm and 3.22pm.)May says it is not possible to revoke article 50 and then trigger it again a few months later. The European court of justice ruling on this was clear, she claims. She says revoking article 50 means staying in the EU.Asked if May is saying that, if her deal is voted down, she will definitely proceed with a no-deal Brexit, May says that the process she will follow is set down in legislation (ie, the government will make a statement and allow MPs to vote).Here is Theresa May delivering her Commons statement, as photographed by Jessica Taylor, the Commons’ official photographer.Labour’s Clive Efford says May is about to “squander” billions on no-deal planning when there is no majority for no deal in the Commons. That is completely unjustifiable, she says.May says, if MPs do not approve her deal, the government will make a statement about the next steps.Labour’s Diana Johnson asks May if she can imagine any circumstances in which she would extend article 50.May says 29 March is set down already in legislation as the date for the UK leaving.Labour’s Ruth George says she has surveyed thousands of leave voters in her constituency. She says half of them want to stay in the customs union or the single market. May should listen to them, she says.May says she does listen to voters.Labour’s Wes Streeting says May will not say her deal is better than the one we already have. What sort of PM would propose something worse than the status quo? And what sort of PM would not rule out a no-deal Brexit? Isn’t that an insult to the office of prime minister? (He is referring to what May said about Tony Blair.)May say Streeting is implying that staying in the EU is an option. After the referendum, it isn’t, she says.Labour’s Jack Dromey asks May to rule out now a no-deal Brexit.May says manufacturing industry welcomed her deal.Labour’s Stephen Kinnock asks May to confirm that the Norway plus option would avoid the need for a backstop.May says Norway plus is not something that can just happen. It would require a negotiation, for the UK to join Efta. As part of that negotiation, the need for a backstop would be considered, she says.This is from Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications chief and a leading People Vote campaigner, referring to what May said a few minutes ago. (See 5.06pm.)Labour’s Catherine West asks if May has advice for a constituent who is stockpiling insulin.May says the Department of Health is putting plans in place to protect supplies of medicines.Labour’s Chris Bryant says, by delaying the vote for 28 days, the PM is playing into the hands of the EU. She could invite every MP to her home for Christmas, but she would still lose. So why won’t she call the vote now?May says she is still seeking assurances.Layla Moran, the Lib Dem MP, asks if it is true that Theresa May is now taking advice on this from David Cameron.May says Cameron is not giving her advice. She says they last spoke when the withdrawal agreement was finalised. She spoke to two former PMs at the time about this as a courtesy, she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1374239c05067123d7f398863e48aa3d6054b384/0_14_3663_2199/master/3663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d139d80973f9583f1c4ab5910e0090","title":"can you solve it do you speak twitter","story":"Test your knowledge of Tweet-speak, plus a social media maths puzzleUPDATE: to read the answers and solution click here.This week, two puzzles about social media.

One AU is equal to the average distance from the Earth to the sun, or just under 150m kilometres. The previous furthest known object was Eris, 96 AU from the sun.The discovery was made by Scott S Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, David Tholen of the University of Hawaii and Chad Trujillo of Northern Arizona University. It was announced on Monday by the Minor Planet Center.The same team were responsible for the discovery this year of a minor planet nicknamed The Goblin, 80 AU away. The Goblin’s orbit suggested that it may be influenced by an as yet undiscovered large planet near the edge of the solar system.However, the team said they did not yet know enough about Farout to tell whether it was being influenced by the putative Planet X.“2018 VG18 is much more distant and slower moving than any other observed solar system object, so it will take a few years to fully determine its orbit,” said Sheppard. “But it was found in a similar location in the sky to the other known extreme solar system objects, suggesting it might have the same type of orbit that most of them do.“The orbital similarities shown by many of the known small, distant solar system bodies was the catalyst for our original assertion that there is a distant, massive planet at several hundred astronomical units shepherding these smaller objects.”Tholen said: “All that we currently know about 2018 VG18 is its extreme distance from the sun, its approximate diameter and its colour. Because 2018 VG18 is so distant, it orbits very slowly, likely taking more than 1,000 years to take one trip around the sun.”The team say Farout’s brightness suggests it is about 500km (310 miles) wide, and it is probably spherical. It has a pinkish hue, which they say means it is probably covered in ice.Trujillo hailed the international nature of the discovery, which involved telescopes in Hawaii and Chile owned and operated by Japan, and researchers based in the US.“With new wide-field digital cameras on some of the world’s largest telescopes, we are finally exploring our solar system’s fringes far beyond Pluto,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca89705fb6d4c3ca5077eccfe4032891716e309f/0_119_4236_2542/master/4236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7aa03e10ae5722778becda4bcd736569","title":"amber rudd urged to make benefits system more humane for christmas","story":"SNP calls for reinstatement of £10 ‘bonus’ payment and pause in sanctioning claimantsAn MP has urged the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, to make the benefits system more humane over Christmas by reinstating a long-standing £10 extra payout and returning to a previous pause on sanctioning claimants over the festive period.The SNP’s Hannah Bardell said Rudd, who pledged last week to make sure the social security system helped people when they most needed it, should act on her words and do the “decent and right thing”.In a letter to Rudd, she highlighted the decision to partially scrap the £10 Christmas “bonus”, in place since 1972 for many people on benefits. It will not be paid to those receiving universal credit, the new, combined system for working and unemployment payments.While the sum was small, Bardell wrote – it has been unchanged since 1972 – it was “the difference between some people eating and not”.She also demanded a reinstatement of a traditional pause over the festive period of sanctioning claimants, in which their payments are docked or stopped as punishment for alleged failures to comply with jobcentre rules.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has told Bardell this has not been a national policy since 2010, but she wrote that a senior department official had told her it had only been scrapped in 2014.Bardell told the  the official told her that when the policy was first ended, her office “had to send members of staff home on Christmas Eve very, very distressed because they’d had to sanction people over the Christmas and new year period, and the people they were sanctioning were massively distressed”.Bardell said: “It caused a huge amount of upset among staff, and really damaged morale.”Reports have concluded that the sanctions system is ineffective in getting jobless people into work, and tends to have disastrous effects on people’s welfare.In the letter, Bardell said Christmas was a difficult time anyway for people in poverty. She wrote: “It is completely and utterly morally unjustifiable and totally heartless to cut people’s benefits at Christmas time.”Rudd said she wanted a benefits system “that gets help to people when they most need it, represents the best of British values and has women and children at its heart”.Bardell said the decision to push ahead with ending the £10 payments and sanctioning claimants over Christmas was completely contradictory to this stated intent.“At the very least, having a pause around Christmas is the decent and right thing to do,” she said. “It’s not a huge ask. It’s not going to cost them any money. It’s just the right thing to do. People will still be sanctioned in the new year.“But at a time when there’s so much uncertainty over Brexit and so much damage done by the benefits system, if she really wants to live by the mantra she’s trying to set out, this would be a really positive, decent that she could thing. It’s about deeds, not words.”A DWP spokeswoman said people on universal credit who also receive other benefits, such as personal independence payments, will still get the £10.She said: “Sanctions are only used in a very small percentage of cases and work coaches take people’s personal circumstances into account. Universal credit claimants have never received a one-off December payment, but many disabled people on universal credit will be better off on average by £100 month than when they received ESA.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8308c0eb709ad1badf8be90bc1d7feecb85f894f/0_8_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebaf9c202d4da38d2e81033159f31868","title":"lack of sleep linked junk food cravings study suggests","story":"Researchers say tired people are likely to view unhealthy snacks more favourablyHaving even one night without sleep leads people to view junk food more favourably, research suggests.Scientists attribute the effect to the way food rewards are processed by the brain. Previous studies have found that a lack of shuteye is linked to expanding waistlines, with some suggesting disrupted sleep might affect hormone levels, resulting in changes in how hungry or full people feel.But the latest study suggests that with hormones may have little to do with the phenomenon, and that the cause could be changes in the activity within and between regions of the brain involved in reward and regulation. .“Our data brings us a little closer to understanding the mechanism behind how sleep deprivation changes food valuation,” said Prof Jan Peters, a co-author of the research from the University of Cologne.Writing in the Journal of Neuroscience, Peters and colleagues describe how they recruited 32 healthy men aged between 19 and 33 and gave all of them the same dinner of pasta and veal, an apple and a strawberry yoghurt.Participants were then either sent home to bed wearing a sleep-tracking device, or kept awake in the laboratory all night with activities including parlour games.All returned the next morning to have their hunger and appetite rated, while 29 of the men had their levels of blood sugar measured, as well as levels of certain hormones linked to stress and appetite. Participants also took part in a game in which they were presented with pictures of 24 snack food items, such as chocolate bars, and 24 inedible items, including hats or mugs, and were first asked to rate how much they would be willing to pay for them on a scale of €0-€3.During a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan, they were asked to choose whether or not they would actually buy the object when its price was fixed – an experiment that allowed researchers to look at participants’ brain activity upon seeing pictures of food and other items.A week later, the experiment was repeated, with the participants who had previously stayed up allowed to sleep, and vice versa.The results showed that whether sleep-deprived or not, participants were similarly hungry in the morning, and had similar levels of most hormones and blood sugar. However, when participants were sleep-deprived, they were willing to pay more for a food snack than when rested, and had higher levels in their blood of a substance called des–acyl ghrelin – which is related to the “hunger hormone” ghrelin, though its function is not clear.The fMRI results showed that when sleep-deprived, participants had greater activity in the brain’s amygdala (where food rewards are processed) when food images were shown, and a stronger link between the price participants would pay for food and activity in the hypothalamus (which is involved in regulating consumption). Interactions between these two regions increased compared with when participants had slept.But the team found there was no link between iniduals’ changes in levels of des–acyl ghrelin and any of the brain or behaviour differences – although Peters said that could be because levels were very high and participants were equally hungry whether rested or not. This, the team said, suggested changes in brain activity in response to images of food after a bad night’s sleep were not just about hormones.But Peters said that what was driving the changes in activity in the amygdala and hypothalamus was unclear. “We know that changes in other neurotransmitters such as dopamine occur following sleep deprivation, so this might be another candidate,” he said.Christian Benedict, a neuroscientist at Uppsala University in Sweden who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research. He said when iniduals were sleep-deprived, their brains used more energy, so it makes sense that the brain would promote signals that might increase the consumption of food, and not waste energy on controlling impulses.But he noted that the research had limitations, including that it was small and that blood was not taken when participants were viewing images of food during the scanning task. The study also did not compare the participants’ responses to healthy food.He said it was important to remember that many factors besides sleep can affect body weight. “It is not only about sleep. Physical activity matters, dietary things, food and accessibility. So we should not break it down only to sleep.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/708bd6cc7ecf2c184291ef25ecd79e9a1206d1bc/0_158_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c3876001e4245cc7f759380b48913ba","title":"england netball spoty double future","story":"English netball walked away with two BBC prizes but attention swiftly turned from celebrations to plans for the futureThe day after the night before, and England Netball had already moved on from their unexpected triumph at the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year awards.The Commonwealth gold medal-winning squad were named both Team of the Year and creators of the Greatest Moment of the Year, provoking scenes of celebration in the aisles at Birmingham’s Resorts World Arena. The party did not last for long, though. Players were under strict instruction not to overdo the celebrations on Sunday night and, by Monday lunchtime, they were back at their training camp in Loughborough.The Roses are preparing for the next round of fixtures in the Quad Series, which take place in January and include a rematch with their Commonwealth final opponents Australia. These matches will form one crucial staging post in a year those in charge of the sport hope will continue to build on the momentum of the past six months. Then, next July, the Vitality Netball World Cup comes to Liverpool.England’s captain, Ama Agbeze, tried to capture the emotion, and the challenges, brought about by the team’s recent success. “We’re ecstatic at winning this award and it’s amazing to be part of something England Netball have been trying to achieve for years”, she said.“It’s been quite a whirlwind since the Games, with netball thrust into the spotlight in the UK, and more people taking the sport up daily. There’s still so much we have to do, especially with the World Cup next year. But thank you to the netball community, including the many new inductees – we’re grateful for the support.”Agbeze’s remarks chime with the ambitions of the sport as a whole. Joanna Adams, the chief executive, says the strategy of England Netball is to “build a version of the game that’s right for any woman or girl”. Success on the Gold Coast and in the West Midlands has accelerated that process. England netball claim that in the three months following the Commonwealth games 130,700 women either took up the sport for the first time or sought out opportunities to play more.“Higher public awareness helps to drive every one of the targets we have. It helps to drive participation and fundamentally we’re about getting women and girls to play the sport. It helps us drive sponsorship, we’ve just signed with Nike which is a massive perception change for our sport. We’ve got a quad series we need to sell, and it helps with that too.”Adams says the Nike kit manufacturing deal in particular is transformative – “Netball is now seen as a truly athletic sport we’ve gone from navy blue knickers to Nike” – but that to maintain the growth in 2019 the England team will have to continue to be successful.“We talk about this all the time, continue and repeat what we’ve done”, she added. “We can’t have the gold as a one off, we have to continue to be best in the world. The Vitality Netball Superleague is really important, to keep the story alive between internationals, and there will be more investment into that over next couple of years.“That will be where a lot of the growth will come from, and will hopefully drive more women and girls to play the sport. We can never stop doing that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee99902c3748b414a4942a701a20d804be04f962/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c997c2f0abe955d65bc042b9e845bf82","title":"jacob stockdale ireland six nations new zealand world cup interview","story":"Jacob Stockdale might be the deadliest finisher in European rugby but he reflects on his remarkable year with a light touch. The Ulster wing was the player of the tournament while setting a Six Nations record by scoring seven tries as Ireland sealed the grand slam. Stockdale also made the difference with the only try of the game when Ireland beat New Zealand last month to complete a year in which they could claim to be the best side in the world.Stockdale has already told me about going into jail with his father, the chaplain at Maghaberry prison in Belfast, so he could talk to inmates who have been locked up after committing violent crimes. He has also confirmed his love for Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan and proved himself an assured 22-year-old who is different to many of his contemporaries. It is striking that, before we discuss his try against the All Blacks, Stockdale has a laugh about himself as he remembers missing the first time Ireland beat New Zealand – in a momentous match in Chicago in November 2016.He had made his debut for Ulster only that year and so he was not a member of the Irish squad. “Devastatingly, I didn’t see it live,” Stockdale says on a quiet afternoon in Belfast. “I watched the game later, on record, but I was actually at a play. Everyone was like: ‘What did you think of the game?’ I had to say: ‘I wasn’t watching it’ and they went: ‘What!’”Stockdale looks horrified. He then smiles when I say that, hopefully, he enjoyed the theatre. What did he see? “I can’t remember. It was terrible. I was actually with my ex-girlfriend and her parents. During the interval, turning my phone on, I said: ‘Can I check the score?’ and she goes: ‘I’ll do it.’ She says: ‘22-0’ and I went: ‘Oh, New Zealand are running away with it.’ She said: ‘No. 22-0 to Ireland.’ For the rest of the play I was like: ‘Get me out of here.’ I got straight home and watched it the whole way through. One of the most historic matches in Irish rugby … and I missed it.”He helped Ireland achieve something more substantial when beating New Zealand in Dublin. “It was an incredible experience to be involved in that game,” Stockdale says of last month’s epic match. “To be the first team to beat the All Blacks in Dublin, and to get a try, was special.”Stockdale’s try displayed his speed, guile, opportunism and strength in a few blurring moments which set the Aviva Stadium alight. But he concentrates on Ireland’s execution of a plan which their coach, Joe Schmidt, had hatched five years before. It was clever and clinical as Johnny Sexton, in a deft change, switched direction and set Bundee Aki free. The inside-centre spun out a long pass to the flying Stockdale. There was still a lot of work to do and Stockdale ran hard before arcing the ball over the onrushing defence, coolly collecting the rebound and holding off the desperate attempts to stop him.“It was a set play Joe ran back in 2013,” Stockdale reveals. “It didn’t work but that’s what Joe does. If it doesn’t work he’ll put it into some big filofax of plays. He puts it on the back burner for a couple of years and then brings it out again. This time it worked. The biggest part of that plan is making sure their 15 goes so you can isolate that corner. You want their forwards to be chasing round the corner and then you step back inside. It wasn’t set for me to kick it but I saw Ben Smith rush up and that space opened up. So I chipped it through. Luckily that one didn’t get charged down.”Stockdale can see himself catching the ball and, using all his strength, resisting Aaron Smith hanging on to his legs as he burst over the line. Stockdale was buried beneath a green pile of jubilant teammates. His try swung the match towards Ireland with a 16-6 lead early in the second half.That truth is plain when considering Sexton, Peter O’Mahony, CJ Stander, Cian Healy, Tadhg Furlong, Rob Kearney and Ireland’s hard core. But the tyros, led by Stockdale, give Ireland real zip. They carry no psychological baggage because, in 2016, even before the senior team won in Chicago, Stockdale and his teammates beat New Zealand Under-20s.“I don’t know whether that under-20’s result made a big difference. There was not a single player from their under-20s playing for the All Blacks in Dublin. But we had massive confidence from winning in Chicago. That’s knowing, if you play well, you are more than capable of beating them.”Stockdale’s growing maturity also stems from his family – with his father Graeme exerting a profound influence. He might have been announced as BBC Northern Ireland’s Sports Personality of the Year but there is no swagger in Stockdale as he describes visiting Maghaberry with his dad so he could participate in a Q\u0026ampA with the prisoners. “Going into the prison was a brilliant experience. It’s the highest security prison in Northern Ireland and I suppose it’s where the worst of the worst are housed. But Dad’s work is brilliant and I was really proud to see how he changes people’s lives.”What questions did the prisoners ask Stockdale? “A lot was how I deal with setbacks and losses. Also, how fast can I run? How much can I bench? There was a good array of questions.”Did he quickly forget that the men were prisoners? “Yeah. That was the one thing which surprised me. Going into the prison you expect a very hostile environment with lots of tough guys. It’s the opposite. Many are really nice blokes. They made a mistake and while they’re inside they want to improve themselves. A lot do degrees. I was chatting to a guy who has done a strength and conditioning degree. The knowledge gained in prison was impressive.”Stockdale shows me his tattoo of a cross. I suggest he must have seen impressive inkwork in Maghaberry. “Yeah,” he laughs, “there were a few good prison tattoos.”It’s not surprising to learn that Stockdale had begun a criminology degree which he only set aside when his rugby career took over. “I’d really like to go back it. I enjoyed studying it but it depends what I decide to do with life after rugby. I would love to be a coach. I’d love to get into the media. It’s deciding what best suits me and doing a degree around it.”It’s unusual to hear a whiz-kid, on the brink of stardom, thinking about coaching. “I have done some coaching at Lurgan,” Stockdale says, “and had a wee bit of experience coaching first years at my old school – Wallace in Belfast. I really enjoyed it.”Stockdale smiles and points out that, for all his exploits with Ireland, life in Belfast is grounded. “Once you’re back here you get brought to ground pretty quickly. I’m also excited playing for Ulster. We’ve got a young, hungry squad. This season we’re under no illusions we’re going to be world beaters. That takes a while but we’re competitive. We’re picking up wins.”Having beaten Scarlets away and at home the last two weeks, Ulster have a real chance of making the Champions Cup quarter-finals. Stockdale scored in both matches and, with the year almost over, he allows himself to look ahead briefly to the World Cup. Does he think about winning the tournament?“Everybody else is saying it out loud for us. Any player with a Tier One nation who says they’re not thinking about the World Cup would be lying. You don’t say: ‘Hopefully we’ll get to the semis and then go out.’ Winning it is a massive goal. New Zealand are still the side to beat but we’ve won two of our last three games against them. They have that World Cup history and experience but I don’t think there’s the fear of New Zealand like before. We’re in a good position. We’re very confident.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0b8db723af0e0e05a94b9abb8d2d6832efbab4/0_317_3893_2335/master/3893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08eb8331507c6a48fa1db0b7b98fdb85","title":"top 10 dance shows 2018","story":"Romeo and Juliet muddled into middle age, Akram Khan suffered shell-shock, Rambert2 lost control – and William Forsythe gave ballet a stratospheric street shakeupOver the decades, William Forsythe’s relationship with ballet has been stretched almost to breaking point – his choreography testing, fragmenting and discombobulating the basic principles of classicism. Now, aged 68, he seems to have fallen back in love with the form. Two of the most purely enjoyable works of 2018 were created by the veteran iconoclast in full-on ballet mode.Playlist (Track 1, 2), a coup of a commission by English National Ballet, was shameless in celebrating the collective virtuosity of its 12 male dancers. The first half, set to the smooth poppy beat of Peven Everett’s Surely Shorty was all about pattern and speed, needlepoint footwork, feathery beats and delirious spins that were orchestrated into zigzagging counterpoint and configurations. When the music shifted to a Jax Jones remix of Lion Babe’s Impossible the dancers flew into stratospheric jetés and pirouettes, their super-refined athleticism inflected with a rollicking street energy.A similar vibe was channelled into A Quiet Evening of Dance, an all-Forsythe programme that started out as a witty ABC of classical shape and line, and evolved into a dazzle of loose-limbed postmodernism and balletic exuberance. Performed by some of the choreographer’s most long-standing dancers, with a startling addition of b-boy brilliance from Rauf “RubberLegz” Yasit, this programme was beautiful not only for the breathtaking rigour of its construction but also for how it joyfully illuminated the inidual quirks and genius of its seven dancers.Petipa’s La Bayadère is fraught with problematic silliness, not least the Manichean catfight into which it casts its rival heroines – pure Nikiya and ruthlessly entitled Gamzatti. However the Royal’s decision to alternate Marianela Núñez and Natalia Osipova in the two ballerina roles allowed for interesting, even unexpected nuance. While Núñez’s refined musicality made for a Nikiya of exquisite otherworldliness and added an elegantly patrician gloss to her nemesis, Osipova’s hurtling physicality lent a headstrong sensuality to Nikiya’s character, just as it gave her Gamzatti a blatant and chilling edge of menace. The dancers inspired each other to dancing and acting of the highest level, raising this hokiest of 19th-century ballets to moments of piercing artistry.In this funny but achingly sad rewrite of Shakespeare, Ben Duke allowed the world’s most famously tragic lovers to survive into middle age, and in doing so turned their story into a meditation on the muddle, disappointment and compromise of marriage. There was brilliant chemistry between Duke’s rumpled, ironic Romeo and Solène Weinachter’s Juliet, angrily exhausted by the juggling of work and motherhood. In every vocal and physical inflection we saw layers of the couple’s emotional history: haunted by the glamour and intoxication of first love, ravaged by the knowledge that the reality of their relationship has fallen so far short of the illusory perfection of art.Commissioned for the 14-18 NOW programme, Shobana Jeyasingh’s superbly concentrated work took an oblique route into the subject of the first world war, evoking the carnage of that period through the Spanish flu pandemic. Sections of fiercely poetic dance evoked the migration of the virus itself – an alien life force that deformed and distorted the bodies of its eight female dancers. The abstract became the human during the work’s second half, as the choreography portrayed the anguish not only of the victims themselves but also those who kept vigil by their bedsides. It showed Jeyasingh at her most humane but also at her most uncompromisingly original and intelligent.Khan’s magisterial achievement in this, the last solo creation of his career, was to evoke the terror and the pity of the first world war without deploying a single familiar image or cliche. Commemorating the Indian soldiers who served in the trenches, Khan­ conjured the special hell these men endured, profoundly dislocated as they were from everything they knew. Objectively, the solo may have suffered from structural problems, but Khan’s performance as a shell-shocked soldier was riveting his body a reeling, ricocheting portrait of trauma and damage.Cherkaoui’s meditation on our twin impulses to create and destroy was embodied in a joyously ambitious mix of movement, philosophy and sculpture, a collaboration with Antony Gormley and performed by GöteborgsOperans Danskompani. While the choreography treated the dancers as human clay, moulding, massing and pulling them apart, there was physical clay on stage, too – three-and-half tonnes of it, which the dancers sculpted into the objects and ornaments of their everyday lives. Fragments of text, achingly beautiful music and larky jokes combined with potently inventive movement to conjure moments of dizzying metaphysical illumination.Formosa was Lin Hwai-min’s farewell production for Cloud Gate, the company he founded back in 1973, and it was also one of the most magical creations of his career. Typically exquisite and distilled, it mapped the history of Lin’s native Taiwan, evoking its ancestral communities, its wildlife and landscape. No less remarkable were the sections that dealt with darkness and conflict, the stage almost buckling under the violence of war and natural disaster. The greatness of the work, however, lay in its finale, where the choreography moved into clear, blue sky, and Lin reached for a world beyond struggle and human history.The Royal’s centenary tribute to Leonard Bernstein generated two very fine commissions: Christopher Wheeldon’s elegantly Dionysiac work Corybantic Games and Wayne McGregor’s Yugen. The latter, a setting of the Chichester Psalms, proved to be one of the most rich and accomplished classical works of McGregor’s career. Moving within the luminous spaces of Edmund de Waal’s set, the choreography sought out the lyricism of Bernstein’s score in long, floating lines and, to a degree entirely unexpected for this most secular of choreographers, brought a mystic tenderness to its narrative of religious quest and transcendence.Papaioannou has the skills of an illusionist. Not only the trompe l’oeil of limbs that look as if they’ve switched bodies, but the way his distinctive brand of beautifully crafted dance theatre unfolds like a slo-mo film of a flower opening. You barely see anything happening and then suddenly: full bloom. The Great Tamer was full of small revelations and epiphanies, drawing on big themes of Papaioannou’s Greek heritage, classical iconography and art.Thirteen hungry, just-graduated dancers threw themselves into the debut of Rambert2, Rambert’s new sister company. The standout work was Sharon Eyal’s in-your-face Killer Pig, full of catwalk swagger, fierce attack and impressive precision, whether slow-convulsing body rolls or full-throttle grand jetés blasting round the stage. This was exciting, unnerving, bristling with youth and volume. It felt like coming home early and finding your teenagers throwing a party that got out of control."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc53aca11053a0fd7e00cf61c44ea045f887c5df/0_0_5568_3340/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00a415c736bb4f311be0b5eb0df36402","title":"facebook christmas party celebration","story":"The network held its Christmas party at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco – but was there much to celebrate after a year of scandal?Last weekend, Facebook hosted a lavish two-day Christmas party for employees. The event, held this year at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, had a winter village theme. It looked like a lovely time for all!The party was documented by attendees who naturally posted pictures to Instagram (owned by Facebook!). In one corner they delighted to dancers and performers dressed as elves, and discussed perhaps the news this weekend (posted on a blog by Facebook on Friday evening) that a bug had let developers see photos that users uploaded but never actually posted. It affected 6.8 million users. Or maybe they didn’t bother discussing this – it seemed a relatively minor screw-up based on the year Facebook has had.Elsewhere in the beautiful space, guests took in chainsaw ice sculptures such as one of a cool-looking polar bear who is probably unaware of the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica affair, in which a whistleblower revealed that 50 million user profiles had been harvested in a data breach. Or another unrelated bug in June that affected up to 14 million users causing posts to be published publicly that were intended to be private.Another area of the palace decked out with a skiing theme featured a gondola, where revelers may or may not have remembered the time in September where hackers were able to steal the information of millions of other Facebook users.It’s hard to tell from the Instagram posts what sort of banter the guests indulged in in a “thumbs-up tavern”, where Facebook workers could get drinks. Maybe they discussed the company being dragged in front of British MPs for questioning over, among other things, whether or not they knew and did anything about Russians harvesting large amounts of user data every day back in 2014?It may have been hard to hear over the drummers par-um-puh-pum-pumming, so there’s no way to confirm whether anyone expressed an opinion on how Mark Zuckerberg and others handled the response to the New York Times story in November about Facebook’s employment of PR firm Definers Public Affairs, and the firm’s attempts to smear Facebook’s critics such as George Soros with an antisemitic narrative. Maybe someone brought it up and was drowned out by the music. The toy soldiers don’t look like they were much for conversation anyway.It’s also unclear if any of the journalists who have partnered with Facebook as factcheckers were invited to the party, but considering recent reports that many have lost faith in Facebook’s commitment to the effort and that they believe they’ve been used as crisis PR, they might not have shown anyway.Or perhaps talk drifted to Facebook’s part in the spread of misinformation and human rights abuses in Myanmar? Or about how false rumours on Whatsapp in April (owned by Facebook!) had Indian authorities scrambling to combat a spate of murders linked to the viral misinformation? Or maybe they discussed how Sri Lanka had blocked access to Facebook, WhatsApp AND Instagram in March to try to curb mob violence directed at its Muslim minority after a series of inflammatory posts on the social media platforms.These are not particularly festive topics, but the end of the year is typically the time for taking stock. Facebook did, in its own inimitable style. No one has yet posted an image from the party of a large ice sculpture offering a two-fingered salute to the world after the network’s annus horribilis. But we’re sure it’s out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4857b10b8495fff2a70f4a0e5b379e8ee659bed3/0_304_4618_2770/master/4618.jpg?width=980\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4ebf3f5b1ccb32e0c1262ce7d086cee 980w","title":"24 hours in ae review trauma tears and triage in real life casualty","story":"High drama at St George’s in south-west London as the consistently excellent docu-series reaches its 200th episodeSo, the NHS is 70 and 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE (Channel 4) is 200. Episodes, that is, not years old, although sometimes it does feel as if we’ve been gripped by this particular strain of long-term docu-series for a couple of centuries. Anyway, don’t expect cake, although there is a jaunty song about a cup of tea. What you are guaranteed is another 24-hour cycle stuffed with trauma and drama, fractures and tears. After all, neither A\u0026ampE departments nor the accidents and emergencies that engulf them give a fig about anniversaries.It’s business as usual at St George’s in south-west London, one of the busiest emergency departments in Britain. “Adult. Female. Trauma. ETA 10 minutes,” comes the first call to the red phone. Eighteen-year-old motorcyclist Ky has been knocked off her Yamaha Cruiser in a hit-and-run while on her way to Asda to get petrol. The driver of the car drove straight through the garage and disappeared. “I heard the massive crunch of metal and saw her flipping through the air,” says her mum, Sam, who was driving in front and saw everything. “I really did believe that was it.”As Ky is scanned to see if her broken pelvis has led to an internal bleed, we hear more about her life. First the heart-stopping trauma, then the heart-tugging backstory. A bit like emotional CPR. Ky’s father left when she was three. She was severely bullied at school and ended up studying at home for her GCSEs. On results day she dyed her hair and got a piercing then marched in to school, electric-blue head held high, and turned her life around. “She’s my absolute world,” says Sam, speaking on behalf of pretty much every parent on the planet. And isn’t that the point of this series (apart from to frighten us witless)? To remind us that illness is the great leveller. Everybody hurts, and everybody is capable of being sucked into an episode of 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE.But it was the other major event – each episode focuses on two – that made me cry. And fear ladders. And want to text “I love you” to my partner, which I didn’t do because I refuse to be so brazenly manipulated by a TV show. Aleks, 41, had fallen 10ft off a ladder trying to reach her loft and landed on her head. Her nine-year-old son found her. She has severe memory loss, which could point to a catastrophic brain injury, and keeps repeating the same heartbreaking phrases. “I’ve got two boys …” “My two boys, are they OK?” “Did I hurt anyone?”Her husband, Paulo, is terrified. “We just love each other,” he says. “Everything makes sense when she’s around.” Outside the hospital he phones a friend: “Fucking hell, man … scariest day of my life.” When Rahul, the unflappable registrar, gets the x-rays back and reveals there has been no bleed or fractures to Aleks’s head or neck, the tears of relief, exhaustion and horror at our unending proximity to calamity were uncontainable. Paolo cried, too.Away from the high dramas of resus, receptionist Julie – one of the longest serving members of staff at St George’s – is having a boogie and a gossip. Her own story involves caring for her nan and mum until they died and marrying a serial cheater who was having an affair with a woman from the next road along. Now she is with a banker who “wears glasses” and is “a bit fuddy-duddy” but adores her. The receptionists have a laugh about the fact that it took him three months to hold her hand. Everyone’s stories matter in A\u0026ampE. And even the moments providing levity are sad.Let’s admit it, the main reason for tuning in to this series, which is always better than I think it’s going to be, is the relief it guarantees. Also, the perspective: today, this is not happening to me. I have not fallen off a ladder or found out my loved one has been in a hit and run. I’m just having a mildly crap day watching a bit of telly. Admittedly, it’s an anxiety-inducing kind of relief, because there is always tomorrow, but in 2018 this is about as elevating as my gratitude journal is going to get. So happy 200th, 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE. May you still be reassuring us and terrifying us in another 200 episodes.

One was led by experts from Oxford University and the other by New Knowledge, an American cybersecurity firm.New Knowledge said Russia had waged a five-year “propaganda war” against the US public. The Oxford researchers said that while the propaganda was meant to “push and pull” Americans in different directions, “what is clear is that all of the messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican party – and specifically, Donald Trump”.Both reports faulted the major social media companies – Facebook, Twitter and Google – for what they said were ongoing failures to turn over exhaustive data to US authorities investigating the Russian campaign. They said some executives had “misrepresented or evaded” and “dissembled” in statements to Congress.Mark Warner, the committee’s senior Democrat, said new laws were needed to tackle a crisis around social media. “These attacks against our country were much more comprehensive, calculating and widespread than previously revealed,” said Warner.More than a dozen Russians have been criminally charged with hacking and other online activity by special counsel Robert Mueller and other US prosecutors investigating Moscow’s interference in the 2016 campaign.The new reports said that while it was well known that Russian trolls flooded social media with rightwing pro-Trump material, their subtler efforts to drive black voters to boycott the election or vote for a third-party candidate were underappreciated.One popular bogus Facebook account created by the Russians, Blacktivist, attracted 4.6 million “likes”. It told followers in the final weeks of the campaign that “no lives matter to Hillary Clinton”, that black people should vote for the Green party candidate, Jill Stein, and that “not voting is a way to exercise our rights”.Some black Americans were even weaponised as unwitting “human assets” for the Russian campaign, according to the researchers, who said operatives in St Petersburg worked to recruit people in the US to attend rallies and hand out literature.The Oxford researchers found black Americans were also targeted with more advertisements on Facebook and Instagram than any other group. More than 1,000 different advertisements were directed at Facebook users interested in African American issues, and reached almost 16 million people.The material was intended to inflame anger about the skewed rates of poverty, incarceration and the use of force by police among black Americans to “ert their political energy away from established political institutions”, the report said, adding that similar content was pushed by the Russians on Twitter and YouTube.The New Knowledge researchers agreed that the “most prolific IRA efforts” on Facebook and Instagram were aimed at black Americans in what they called an “immersive influence ecosystem” connecting many different pages posting information and reinforcing one another.In addition to the online posts telling black people their votes would not matter or urging them to vote third-party, Russian operatives tricked people with “vote by text message” scams and tweets designed to create confusion about voting rules, according to New Knowledge.New Knowledge said the social media propaganda campaign should be seen as the third front in Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, together with the hack and theft of Democratic party emails that were passed to WikiLeaks, and the attempt to hack online voting systems across the US.The Oxford researchers said the lack of human editors on platforms such as Facebook was enabling propagandists. “Obviously, democracies need to take computational propaganda seriously as a threat to their public life,” they said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e0bb02c7cf07631a0d194287065b2513c5e35c/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f93900297138162833bcb824661ee5c","title":"statue of liberty climber trial us immigration","story":"Magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein says Therese Patricia Okoumou’s political and moral motivations did not trump the lawAn activist has been found guilty of a series of federal crimes after she climbed on to the base of the Statue of Liberty this summer to protest against the US policy of separating migrant families and holding children in detention.Magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein convicted Therese Patricia Okoumou, who goes by Patricia, on Monday afternoon after a one-day bench trial in New York, asserting that the protester’s political and moral motivations did not trump the law.Okoumou had grown teary on Monday as she told a judge in New York about how the treatment of children at the US-Mexico border prompted her to scale the statue in a high-profile protest on the Fourth of July this year.“I wanted to send a strong statement that children do not belong in cages,” said Okoumou, on Monday morning at the start of her trial at the Manhattan federal court.But in convicting her, Gorenstein wasn’t swayed, saying upon his guilty verdict that if he didn’t uphold the law simply because of a lawbreaker’s motivation, than it would undermine law in general.“I would violate the oath of my office,” he said.After the trial, Okoumou stood outside the courthouse, thanking friends, her fellow members of the activist group Rise and Resist and supporters in an upbeat tone.“We stand on the right side of the history. I am not discouraged,” she said.“While migrant children who simply came to this country, like our ancestors did, to seek happiness, freedom and liberation. Instead of welcoming them like Lady Liberty symbolizes, instead of treating them with kindness, what we showed them is cages. So if I go in a cage with them, I am on the right side of history.”Okoumou, a Congo-born naturalized US citizen who lives in Staten Island, was found guilty on charges of trespassing and interfering with government agency functions, as well as disorderly conduct, in relation to her climb. She pleaded not guilty.The charges collectively carry punishment of up to 18 months behind bars. She will be sentenced at a later date.Okoumou’s main concern – as it has been since her climb, when she had to be retrieved by law enforcement officers attached to ropes – is the children, she said.Although an executive order last summer reversed the policy of separating children from their parents upon crossing the border unlawfully, the Trump administration reportedly continues to do so by various means, also detaining children who have crossed the border unaccompanied, in hopes of claiming asylum or joining relatives already in the US.Several thousand migrant minors are being held at a growing detention camp near El Paso, Texas. Meanwhile, many children languish in deteriorating conditions on the Mexican side of the border.And as Trump clamps down on asylum applications, many migrants find themselves in an administrative – and humanitarian – limbo. “It would never happen in my country – we don’t treat children like political bait,” she said. “I just have had nightmares and night sweats.”One of Okoumou’s lawyers, civil rights litigator Ron Kuby, asked Okoumou whether she would make the climb again.Kalikow did not ask Okoumou – who wore a cobalt dress with the words “Seeking Asylum is NOT a Crime” for her court appearance – any questions.Earlier in the day, opening statements foreshadowed the tenor of the trial – while prosecutors would focus on rules, Okoumou’s supporters would focus on conscience.“She knew that what she was doing was wrong and illegal,” Kalikow said in his opening statement. “Whether one sympathizes with the defendant politically and morally is not at issue in this case.”Kuby responded in his opening that the family separation policy “created in her an imperative to act”.“She did so on America’s most important day on America’s most important symbol.”The prosecution lauded Gorenstein’s verdict, calling Okoumou’s protest a “dangerous stunt … that endangered herself and the NYPD and US Park Police officers who rescued and apprehended her”.Kalikow said: “The act of climbing the base of the Statue of Liberty went well beyond peaceable protest, a right we certainly respect. It was a crime that put people at grave risk. We commend Judge Gorenstein’s decision to hold Therese Okoumou accountable for her dangerous and reckless conduct.”After the verdict, Hawk Newsome, who heads Black Lives Matter NYC, said: “It’s the government versus Patricia – it wasn’t the people. If it was the people, she would be free.”Avenatti said the verdict was not surprising.“But sometimes you have to stand on principle. History will be incredibly kind to Patricia,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b15f68036f4ce43aa2c52d31aad22e01223d7a3c/0_336_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6708470b3b1aa50e08b69ebfcd518f54","title":"going straight the yakuza gangster who swapped the underworld for udon","story":"As crime syndicates lose their attraction, membership is falling and some are making a new life on the right side of the lawTakashi Nakamoto yells a friendly greeting from the kitchen when he spots a customer slide open the door to his restaurant, his face just visible through the steam rising from pots of stock and boiling water.As he slices leeks and shakes the residual water from another batch of al dente udon noodles, it is easy to miss the most conspicuous physical reminder of Nakamoto’s life before he opened his restaurant, Daruma-ya, in the gritty southwestern city of Kitakyushu in June last year.His missing pinkie is the legacy of three decades entrenched in Japan’s underworld, during which he rose from foot soldier to a senior position in the Kudo-kai, one of the country’s most violent yakuza crime syndicates.After lunch service has ended, Nakamoto can be persuaded to lift up his T-shirt to reveal a tattoo stretching across his back and shoulders and down his arms. “That’s enough, it’s not for show,” he says in a tone that suggests the conversation move towards his extraordinary journey of self-awareness and redemption.“Being a yakuza is not like working for a company or having a career – it’s a way of life,” he tells the  over beers and sashimi at a nearby restaurant. “I was a real tearaway as a young man, so it felt natural to join the yakuza. I would do anything for my organisation. I was a serious gangster.”It is no empty boast. Nakamoto’s years in the Kudo-kai were punctuated by stints in prison, including an eight-year sentence for his part in a violent attack on a Chinese-run massage parlour whose owners had set up shop without the gang’s blessing.Now, though, the 52-year-old is one of a growing number of men who are cutting their yakuza ties to build new lives situated firmly on the right side of the law.His former gang, which has just over 600 members, is behind a string of violent crimes that violated the traditional yakuza code of sparing “civilians”. They include the murder of the head of a fishermen’s cooperative and hand grenade attacks on the city’s Chinese consulate general. In 2000, Kudo-kai members hurled petrol bombs at the constituency home of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe.After a spate stabbings and shootings, in 2010 the national police agency designated the Kudo-kai as a “particularly nefarious group”. Residents took to the streets calling for the gang to be kicked out of their city-centre headquarters.“Usually the yakuza doesn’t target women and other ordinary citizens, but the Kudo-kai was different,” says Masataka Yabu, who led Kitakyushu’s anti-organised crime ision and now heads an organisation campaigning to end yakuza violence. “People wouldn’t testify or pass on information to the police because they were in fear of their lives.”But two decades of stricter anti-gang laws and uncertain economic times have taken their toll on yakuza membership.Members of the Kudo-kai, like those of other yakuza groups, no longer operate with the same near-impunity they enjoyed in the postwar years. Gang bosses can now be charged for crimes committed by their underlings, and local ordinances threaten to publicly name iniduals and companied that do business with the mob. Repeat offenders face fines of up to 500,000 yen and company officials face up to a year in prison.The battle to weaken organised crime is now being fought in the US, where the treasury department has blacklisted yakuza groups that use front companies to launder money and hide illicit profits.“I joined the yakuza when it was at the height of its powers,” Nakamoto says. “It wasn’t about the money or expensive clothes and cars … we thought we were the epitome of the macho Japanese male, putting our lives at risk for our cause. No one wanted to mess with us.”The yakuza gave the young Nakamoto – a high school dropout who barely knew his absentee father – the sense of belonging he had struggled to find in mainstream society. After mixing with gangsters as an estate agent, he joined the Kudo-kai, performing office duties, cooking for his oyabun boss, Hideo Mizoshita, collecting protection money and sourcing cheap labour for construction companies.Nakamoto was in prison in 2008 when he learned that Mizoshita had died. His boss’s death, and pangs of conscience over the misery the gang had inflicted on innocent residents, led him to question his career choice and resolve to cut his yakuza ties for good.He is now four years into a five-year probationary period, during which he is not allowed to rent property or open a bank account, but has at least found a career with long-term prospects.“For someone as senior as Nakamoto-san to quit the yakuza is almost unheard of,” says Hirosue, whose book about Nakamoto was published in July. “He had to put his whole life behind him and learn to be humble. He was once a wealthy man … he certainly isn’t now.”Police and legal crackdowns are taking their toll on gang membership in Japan. The number of yakuza members fell to a record-low of 34,500 in 2017, down 4,600 from the previous year according to the national police agency.In Fukuoka prefecture – home to the Kudo-kai and four other major crime syndicates – membership has declined to just over 2,000 compared with 3,720 a decade ago. To encourage more gang defections, local authorities recently started offering money to newly reformed men to help with their rent and travel expenses for job interviews.“We have to keep encouraging yakuza to quit,” Yabu says. “They think they have a lot to lose, but when you remind them of the terrible things they have done they start to think again. Many of them want to go straight for the sake of their wives and children.“Real-life yakuza are nothing like the honourable men you see in films. They receive good publicity for, say, handing out food and water after a major earthquake, but there is no such thing as a good yakuza.”Nakamoto is grateful to other businesses in the neighbourhood for seeing him through his difficult transition from senior gangster to humble restaurateur. “The people around here have encouraged me a lot, especially when I felt like quitting,” he says.“But the odds are stacked against people like me. It’s not as if I stopped being a gangster and then became just like everyone else. I’m not starting from zero … I’m starting from minus.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how italy populists used facebook win election matteo salvini luigi di maio","story":"Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio eclipsed rivals in online election battle, data showsThe domination of Facebook by Italy’s two populist political leaders, Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio, is revealed in previously unseen data that shows how they exploited video and live broadcasts to bypass the mainstream media and foment discord during the country’s general election.The data, reviewed by the , reveals how the leaders massively expanded their reach with inflammatory and visually arresting posts earlier this year, eclipsing their main rival, the centre-left former prime minister Matteo Renzi, on Facebook.The Facebook data, which captured the engagement metrics on thousands of posts by the six major party leaders in the two months leading up to the election, was collected by academics at the University of Pisa’s MediaLab.It reveals all of the 25 most shared Facebook posts in the two months leading up to the election were videos, live broadcasts or photos from either Salvini, who runs the far-right League, or Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S).The pair, who were rivals during the election but have since become deputy prime ministers in a power-sharing coalition, dominated Facebook traffic with viral videos and personal, off-the-cuff live broadcasts. Salvini and Di Maio also secured about 7.8m Facebook likes and shares each during the two-month campaign.Their nearest rival on Facebook was Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the small populist far-right party Brothers of Italy, whose posts secured 2.6m Facebook likes and shares. Renzi, who posted more text-based updates than any other politician, secured just 1.5m likes and shares.The least effective on Facebook were the former prime minster Silvio Berlusconi and the leftwing politician Pietro Grasso.Prof Gianpietro Mazzoleni, of the University of Milan, who was involved in the Facebook research, said it was common for populist politicians to exploit social media, particularly during the “insurgent phase” of their rise, when they may struggle to get the attention of TV broadcasters and newspapers. “You can speak to the people’s guts on social media much better than on big media,” he said.Salvini, whose Facebook audience of 3.4 million is larger than for any other politician in Europe, amassed the largest total of likes and shares for videos and live broadcasts. The far-right leader has intensified his use of social media since becoming Italy’s interior minister, using the platform to exploit tensions over immigration, publish reported “hate lists” of his enemies and provide Italians with a running commentary on his personal and family life.Salvini’s most popular election video, according to the analysis, was a clip from a European parliamentary speech he incorrectly claimed had been “censored” by the mainstream media. “Be warned,” he says in the clip, “over the last few years Italy has taken in 600,000 fake refugees, not escaping war but bringing war here.”Di Maio’s videos, by comparison, strike a different tone, railing against negative media coverage or political corruption, and they appear to have been widely disseminated by M5S’s young, loyal and digitally active voter base.Only one Facebook post in the top 25 in the dataset was posted by Renzi. It stands apart from his typical updates on Facebook: posted after a long day on the campaign trail, it is an amateurish photo of a birthday cake that his family had baked him and left on a table. Renzi’s caption said: “How nice: life is bigger than politics!” It gained more than 63,000 likes and shares.In an interview with the  in October, Renzi said social media had transformed politics, inflaming passions while simultaneously making voters demand a more responsive kind of politics. “Everything is different,” he said. “The citizens are angry, but social media makes you think: ‘OK the prime minister is exactly at my table.’” He added: “At the same time nothing changes, so there is frustration.”Salvini in particular proved adept at exploiting that frustration through Facebook live videos such as one broadcast from a wall opposite a migrant holding centre. “They want to eat well and be at peace, and who pays for them?” he says. “We do.” In another, broadcast from inside a moving car, Salvini complains about a national song contest that featured lyrics about political refugees over “those who were born here”.Dr Paolo Gerbaudo, from King’s College London, said of Salvini’s use of live video: “He does live streams almost every day, on the roofs of apartment blocks or on the streets in urban areas where he is himself holding the camera – as anyone would do – and that gives a sense of authenticity,” he said.He said Di Maio’s focus on Facebook tallied with the strategic approach of the M5S, which was founded by the comedian and blogger Beppe Grillo and “defined itself from the start as an internet party”.There is growing academic interest in the relationship between social media and populist movements on both the left and right. Facebook and Twitter have transformed western democracies, enabling politicians to bypass traditional gatekeepers and communicate directly with their base.Some political scientists argue they systematically encourage the kind of simplified, isive and caustic rhetoric populists often employ. There is particular concern in Brazil and India about the Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp, which has enabled the dissemination of viral fake news stories behind an encrypted firewall.In France, the anti-establishment gilets jaunes movement that has rocked the presidency of Emmanuel Macron has been orchestrated via Facebook. Some researchers claim an algorithmic change enacted by the social media company last January to combat fake news and downgrade news content had the unintended consequence of fuelling protests.Olivier Ertzscheid, a researcher at the University of Nantes, said Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, hoped the algorithmic change would create “a new social infrastructure to bring people closer to their elected politicians and to allow people to become more involved in the political decisions of their country. The way the gilets jaunes movement was built in France shows that on this point of his strategy, he was absolutely right – it has fuelled the fire.”Additional reporting by Patrick Wintour"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute have notified the State Pathologist\u0026rsquos Office and preserved the sceneChairman of Drumcliffe Development Association says local community is \u0026lsquovery hurt\u0026rsquo by theft of workIncident in Castlerea led to a march of up to 1,000 people in the town last SundayThree men working for private security firm hospitalised after melee at repossessed houseVictim and witnesses would not cooperate with PSNI investigationServing officer pleads not guilty to dangerous driving causing death of 75-year-old pensionerRoofer pleads not guilty to dangerous driving causing death in Blanchardstown, DublinOrders sought by Cab for currency known as Ether or Ethereum, worth about \u0026euro25,000Arturas Bulksas stabbed injured party in the torso, neck and ear, judge hearsIncome and living survey shows overall decline in rates of poverty and depravationYoung man was shot in killing believed linked to the Hutch-Kinahan feudChurch of Ireland prelate rails against inept policymakers and the misery of destitutionJudge says woman \u0026lsquohad put a great deal of effort into continually flouting the law\u0026rsquoHigh court president makes remark during hearing in which two doctors are suspended from practisingNetwork operators warned against using software or hardware made by Chinese firmsAdvertising watchdog said Dealz campaign unnecessarily objectified menJury in murder trial of Maha Al Adheem (43) told the facts of the case are particularly distressing and profoundly sadGarda\u0026iacute to take DNA samples from \u0026lsquoBelle\u0026rsquo in effort to identify the girl\u0026rsquos motherOwner of property also served eviction notice on tenant on the basis that a family member of his would require the property"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Simon FoyAnti-Brexit campaigners seeking a second referendum on EU membership stopped off in Dublin on Monday as part of their tour of the UK and other European countries. The “Bollocks to Brexit” campaign is a grassroots movement encouraging UK citizens to write to their local MP and ask them to force another vote.The campaign’s yellow bus stopped outside the Guinness Storehouse, the British embassy and at Merrion Square before heading for Belfast where it will take part in an anti-Brexit rally on Monday afternoon. On the way, campaigners said, the bus would also stop at the border to highlight its key place in Brexit negotiations. “The reason why we wanted to come to Ireland is that we don’t think enough importance is being given to the issue of the Irish Border and it is the EU’s fundamental bottom line that there can’t be a hard border in Ireland,” said campaign spokeswoman Madeleina Kay. “There are various people in our government pushing for a Brexit that is going to increase the chances of a hard border that will damage the Irish economy and we want to get the message out there that that is not acceptable and that we are fighting and opposing it.”The “Bollocks to Brexit” campaign began after the June 2016 referendum by distributing stickers throughout the UK. It has since developed into a bus tour around 50 towns and cities across the UK and several EU countries, including Belgium and Ireland, which ends in Westminster on December 20th. It is financed through online crowdfunding and says it has raised about £20,000 in recent months. British prime minister Theresa May is expected to tell MPs at Westminster that holding a second EU referendum would “break faith with the British people”.This is despite growing calls for a second referendum amid signs that there is no majority among MPs in the House of Commons for either Mrs May’s deal or leaving the EU without a deal.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Frank Miller The elections are set to take place between May 23rd and 26th 2019 and will probably coincide with the Irish local elections. Cllr Hanafin was previously a Fianna Fáil senior minister for seven years. Her roles included minister for education from 2004 to 2008, minister for social and family affairs from 2008 to 2010 and minister for tourism, culture and sport from 2010 to 2011. Speaking in Blackrock, Co Dublin on Monday, Cllr Hanafin described the upcoming European elections as “the most important ever as we face a period of uncertainty not only in relation to Brexit but for democracy throughout Europe”. “The only democratic voice of the people is through the European Parliament and Ireland needs to elect our strongest and most experienced people as your MEPs,” she said. Ms Hanafin noted that there had not been a Fianna Fáil MEP for Dublin since 2009 and that a convention would be held in January on a one member vote system. “I aim to meet and speak with as many delegates as possible over the next few weeks to win their support to represent Dublin in the European Parliament,” she said. Former Fianna Fáil TDs Barry Andrews and Conor Lenihan, and Tiernan Brady, a leading figure in the same-sex marriage referendum in 2015, have already begun canvassing for a nomination in the 2019 European elections. Mr Andrews, who currently heads the Institute for International and European Affairs, a pro-EU thinktank, is the slight favourite at this stage.Ireland was allotted two additional seats when the European Council decided in June to redistribute 27 of the UK’s seats for the next parliament. However, these two additional Irish MEPs will not be allowed to take up their seats if there is any delay in Britain leaving the European Union.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

He said my children are stupid and that they will be deported back to Poland because they don\u0027t know English.The camera was installed in July 2017. He had an application on his phone which enabled him to watch the camera from work. When I tried to turn it off he would text me to say to put it back on and would watch all the time. I told him I didn\u0027t like the cameras and he said that it was there for my safety because he loves me.Jelen was convicted of an offence of engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour between November 2018 and October this year.Prosecuting lawyer Lucy Bridges said: He installed CCTV into their home so he could watch her in their home. He would say who she can and cannot talk to on social media. There were comments made about her weight, thighs and clothing. He made comments about what she should wear, comments about her breasts and how she is stupid and fat.”She saw a balaclava, gloves and a stick together in the home which she believes was used to intimidate her, she added.Coercive control: How can you tell whether your partner is emotionally abusive?Jelen denied wrongdoing and said: I said once that her legs are a little bit big and we could go to the gym together which she agreed, but she stopped going so I bought gym equipment for the house. She would say \u0027do you like this dress\u0027 and I would say no but I would give her my credit card to buy clothes, whatever she wanted.“I never controlled her. I think she\u0027s just playing a game and she wasn\u0027t terrified.”Jelen will be sentenced later.No deal planning must be the top priority and non-urgent business junked, Cabinet to be toldExclusive: The secret legal advice on extending Article 50 which ministers believe rules out second referendumTheresa May dares Jeremy Corbyn to call vote of confidence that could bring down GovernmentPoacher ordered by judge to watch Bambi once a month in jailMoira Stuart moves to Classic FM after being \u0026#39taken for granted\u0026#39 by BBCComment: Mrs May might be a lame duck, but she\u0026#39s got more power than you think City entrepreneurs and leaders tell Theresa May to call a second EU referendum to unblock Brexit logjamWaitrose customers told they are \u0026#39buying death\u0026#39 at meat counter after vegan activists storm storeSAS veterans win four year battle to save their clubhouse after charity commission steps in to cancel rent increasesPuppy therapy to help prisoners with mental health and addiction launched for the first time in the UKNew cervical cancer test to \u0026#39revolutionise screening\u0026#39 after proving to be four times as effective as a smear check, study finds Homebuyers must get access to flight paths to combat noise pollution, says aviation blueprintChallenge to Hungary\u0026#39s strongman Viktor Orban as \u0026#39slave law\u0026#39 protests rock BudapestComment: Tony Blair is the perfect Remainer bogeyman to terrify MPs into backing the PM\u0026#39s dealTalking Strictly podcast: Dr Ranj on Joe and Dianne - \u0026#39I may have already noticed some things before it was official\u0026#392018 was worst year for violence and abuse against journalists, report saysMaths graduate appears in court charged with murdering his statistician girlfriendStudent loans must be added to deficit, Office for National Statistics saysComment: I don’t know what Jeremy Corbyn is playing at over Brexit.

Only 18 per cent is actually online, of which we are a part but a relatively small part.There\u0027s a huge amount of innovation on the high street and that\u0027s partly because customers have changed the way they want to shop.She said consumers are finding price, choice and convenience on the high street as well as online.Helen Hayes, Labour MP for Dulwich and West Norwood, then challenged Ms Smith on business rates, suggesting that Amazon was getting a much better deal that her bricks and mortar competitors.Ms Smith said the company has other costs to cover, such as in investment in technology and delivery, and that it didn\u0027t search for places with low business rates to avoid paying as much.She said: All retail is highly, highly competitive. We\u0027ve only been here 20 years, we\u0027re a relatively new establishment and we\u0027ve had very heavy investment in that period. So that will mean that profits are lower and therefore tax will be lower in the shorter term.John Lewis said online sales have grown by 600 per cent in the last ten yearsMr Betts formally requested that Amazon provide business rate figures and sales figures at a later date. Ms Smith said she would seek advice before doing so.Andy Mulcahy, Strategy and Insight Director at IMRG, said he didn\u0027t think Amazon was killing the high street.He said: The problem we\u0027ve got here is we\u0027ve got a 20th Century infrastructure in a 21st Century world and it just hasn\u0027t adapted fast enough to the fact that the internet is now the main way through which people engage with stuff.Julie Howkins, a development manager at Hive, agreed that the high street is not being suffocated.She said: One of the successes of the high street has been the regeneration of bookshops. There are more bookshops opening now than there have been for a number of years and that is primarily because they\u0027ve had to respond, they\u0027ve had to change, they\u0027ve had to become more niche, offering a different kind of retail experience - so I think there are some successes on the high street.Clayton Hirst, head of corporate affairs at John Lewis, said online sales have grown by 600 per cent in the last ten years and 40 per cent of trade in John Lewis and Partners is online.But he said 88 per cent of the company\u0027s most loyal customers and 80 per cent of app users also shop in store, adding that the company\u0027s mission is to combine the best of physical and online retailing.Addressing business rates, he said: We aren\u0027t one of the retailers who have been complaining. We believe that there is a need to look at business taxation in the round and the fact that it does weigh very heavily on people and property but we are not of the view that you should design a tax to capture a specific business or a specific business model.It\u0027s fair to say that the UK business taxation system is probably designed in an analogue era and we\u0027re now very much in a digital era.No deal planning must be the top priority and non-urgent business junked, Cabinet to be toldExclusive: The secret legal advice on extending Article 50 which ministers believe rules out second referendumTheresa May dares Jeremy Corbyn to call vote of confidence that could bring down GovernmentPoacher ordered by judge to watch Bambi once a month in jailMoira Stuart moves to Classic FM after being \u0026#39taken for granted\u0026#39 by BBCComment: Mrs May might be a lame duck, but she\u0026#39s got more power than you think City entrepreneurs and leaders tell Theresa May to call a second EU referendum to unblock Brexit logjamWaitrose customers told they are \u0026#39buying death\u0026#39 at meat counter after vegan activists storm storeSAS veterans win four year battle to save their clubhouse after charity commission steps in to cancel rent increasesPuppy therapy to help prisoners with mental health and addiction launched for the first time in the UKNew cervical cancer test to \u0026#39revolutionise screening\u0026#39 after proving to be four times as effective as a smear check, study finds Homebuyers must get access to flight paths to combat noise pollution, says aviation blueprintChallenge to Hungary\u0026#39s strongman Viktor Orban as \u0026#39slave law\u0026#39 protests rock BudapestComment: Tony Blair is the perfect Remainer bogeyman to terrify MPs into backing the PM\u0026#39s dealTalking Strictly podcast: Dr Ranj on Joe and Dianne - \u0026#39I may have already noticed some things before it was official\u0026#392018 was worst year for violence and abuse against journalists, report saysMaths graduate appears in court charged with murdering his statistician girlfriendStudent loans must be added to deficit, Office for National Statistics saysComment: I don’t know what Jeremy Corbyn is playing at over Brexit.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film.

Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. Rashida Jones and Pat Resnick previously joined the project as script writers.9 to 5, for which Parton wrote the song of the same name, is in good place to capture\u0026nbspa new millennial audience: the tune is featured prominently in\u0026nbspDumplin\u0027, a Netflix original film starring Jennifer Aniston.The movie, which is based on a novel by Julie Murphy, focuses on Willowdean Dickson (Danielle Macdonald), a Parton fan who enrols in a beauty pageant – which forces her to re-examine her relationship with her mother (Aniston), herself a former beauty queen.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The remarkable surge in value was followed by a series of price crashes that saw bitcoin tumble by thousands of dollars in the space of just a few days, before a steady decline took hold of the market and forced the cryptocurrency down to today\u0027s price of just $3,400.If losses continue, the price collapse could be worse than any previously experienced by bitcoin.Today is an opportunity to look back at all the people who told you that this was going to be a new world, that you were missing out, or that you didn\u0027t understand the new paradigm taking place, and cut them out of your life, said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at online financial platform Investing.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBitcoin holds a big promise of sovereign and sound money – the bubble we experienced a year ago was an unfortunate consequence of human greed and short term thinking.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearOther analysts say it is difficult to predict\u0026nbspwhether bitcoin will continue to fall, as the nascency\u0026nbspof the cryptocurrency industry means it is still adjusting to many different price factors.One year on from bitcoin’s all-time high, many are questioning how cryptoassets are valued, and whether they are a sensible investment, said Mati\u0026nbspGreen, a market analyst at online trading firm eToro.As a relatively new concept, cryptoassets are still finding their feet in terms of value. It’s important to remember that all assets, in every market, experience a process of price discovery, and that cryptos are no different. Given the rapid growth of the crypto industry in the past years, this process has been accelerated, but long-term investors should not be deterred.CoinMarketCap)Like many other analysts, Mr Green is quick to note that this is not the first cycle that bitcoin has experienced in its 10 year history.Five previous cycles saw bitcoin fall by an average of 85 per cent from its high before eventually recovering to a level above that high.Can Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?The latest price fall may seem dramatic due to the numbers involved but it still only represents an 83 per cent fall in value from its December 2017 price. But bitcoin only needs to fall by another $1,000 before the latest losses become record losses.\u0026nbspAs for a short 2019 outlook, I don\u0027t see Bitcoin reaching new highs in 2019, Mr Thibault said.I believe too many would-be early adopters got burnt badly last year, and once an asset has been labelled a bubble, a gamble, or a speculative investment, it takes time to rebuild the trust and appeal needed to push the asset forward.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s named after the Gemini constellationThe\u0026nbspGeminids’ name is no accident: once it enters Earth’s atmosphere, the meteor shower seems to be coming from the Gemini constellation.In order to spot the\u0026nbspGeminid\u0026nbspmeteor shower, you should thus be looking towards the Gemini constellation, which is well positioned from\u0026nbsp10pm, the American Meteor Society explained.This gives the\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbspa rare status as a major shower experiencing significant activity before midnight.4. It’s also linked to a Greek godSo what exactly causes the\u0026nbspGeminid meteor shower? A celestial object called 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon\u0026nbsp– which is also the son of the solar deity Helios in Greek mythology.It belongs to the Apollo asteroid group, an ensemble of near-Earth asteroids.As 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon, it is followed by a trail of debris. Earth passes through its trail each year, resulting in the display.5. As many as 100 shooting stars are expected to light up the skyThe\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbsphave an hourly rate of 120, the highest listed on the American Meteor Society’s calendar for meteor showers.This means more than 100 shooting stars should appear – though\u0026nbspNASA\u0026nbspcalls the figure a “theoretical maximum” and warns that it represents the experience of a “perfect observer” gifted with “perfect skies”.People residing in suburbs can still expect to see about 30 or 40 meteors per hour, and those living in darker areas on the countryside will be able to spot a bit more than one shooting star per minute.Bad news for people in large cities such as New York or San Francisco: they will see “practically nothing” due to light pollution, the agency warned.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? Ben Chu investigatesClick to followThe IndependentShadow chancellor John McDonnell (right) has suggested Labour could include a pledge to reduce the working week in its next manifestoAs a society we can’t seem to make up our minds about work. Do we want more of it? Or less?There’s a chilling fog of fear over what technological advances will mean for our jobs, with an endless supply of alarming forecasts about how robots and algorithms are set to displace human workers.But there’s also a furnace of angst about low productivity and under-investment by firms in just the kind of innovations that induce those nightmares of a “jobs apocalypse”.Boss wants to make four-day working week trial permanentSome lament the supposed proliferation of pointless, soul-dismantling, “bullshit jobs”. Yet no one gets out the bunting when a struggling company announces redundancies.The UK’s official labour market surveys suggest\u0026nbspmany of us want fewer hours at work, presumably driven by a desire for a healthier “work-life balance”.Yet those same surveys also show that many people also want more hours, that the post-financial crisis curse of “underemployment” has not yet been lifted.Some complain about the raising of the state retirement age and the depressing prospect of being forced to work longer than they planned. But for others the big problem is ageism, the risk of being pressured out of jobs they enjoy prematurely.When it comes to work, we’re rather like those two diners in the Catskill mountains: “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible... Yeah, I know and such small portions.”Yet onto this terrain of confusion and apparent contradiction some stride confidently.To Alex Williams, a Corbynite academic, automation should be embraced by the left as the emancipation of labour, provided the gains are comprehensively redistributed.The Trades Union Congress seems to have been influenced by this cocktail of technological optimism and socialist assertion. Its general secretary\u0026nbspFrances O’Grady\u0026nbsprecently demanded a four-day week by the end of the century, declaring: “Bosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new tech for themselves.”The Labour Party is keen too. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has made favourable noises about the four-day week and is reported to be asking the crossbench peer, Robert Skidelsky, to head an inquiry into the subject.Yet this isn’t just a British story. There are tectonic rumblings from abroad too. The IG Metall union in Germany earlier this year won the right to a four-day week for its almost 900,000 members. One technology start-up, founded by former Google employees, has a “Free Friday” policy. Even a think tank close to the authorities in China has called for the most populous nation on the planet to have a four-day working week as soon as 2030.Any project that can unite German metal bashers, Silicon Valley coders and Chinese Communist apparatchiks clearly has an unusually wide appeal.So is the four-day week a big idea whose time has come? Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? And even if a four-day week is economically feasible, should we really desire it? Or is it a case of being careful what you wish for?When Marei Wollersberger and her colleagues established an east London-based data design agency, Normally, as a four-day week operation in 2014, the motivation was largely personal.“We wanted to lead happier lives basically – enjoy ourselves more, not just to defer our enjoyment to retirement age,” she told me.But there was another goal: “There was also a motivation to be more productive.”The economics of the four-day week revolve around the concept of productivity, the amount we produce per hour worked.The size of the economy – the size of our national income – is derived from the value of all the goods and services produced by businesses and households.On the face of it, if we all worked one less day a week, our personal output would drop by around fifth. Multiply that fall across the overall economy and you’ve got an economy that is considerably smaller, implying lower income and lower living standards for all, one way or another.Yet what if working fewer hours were to stimulate our productivity? What if we produced more per hour working four days than we did per hour working five?In that case there might be no overall drop in total output, and therefore no decrease in living standards. If our productivity rose enough we might even have a higher income than we did before.Wollersberger says the model has worked in stimulating performance at her company. “You’re more productive – you achieve exactly the same or more in four days as you would in five,” she says. “And I honestly believe it’s better work.”\u0026nbspA New Zealand financial firm called Perpetual  found similarly gratifying results when it trialled a four-day week recently.“There was broadly no change in company outputs pre and during the trial,” said its boss. “No reduction in job performance and the survey data showed a marginal increase across most teams.”Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Bear in mind that no change in output despite a fifth less time at work implies a stunning increase in productivity.But beware cherry-picking. The results of a Swedish trial involving 70 nurses working a six-hour day were more mixed. While there was some boost to worker productivity, the city of Gothenburg also had to hire more nurses to cover the hours lost.Intuitively, this seems much more likely to be the result of moving to a four-day week in services sectors that are, currently at least, heavily reliant on face-to-face human interactions such as healthcare or teaching.That’s not to imply the shift in working patterns should be ruled out as impractical. There are benefits in terms of lower stress and happiness to set against those financial costs. But it’s probably unrealistic to expect the move to always pay for itself, at least in the short-term.And some experiments have flopped. Treehouse, an online educational firm in Oregon, was one of those companies which got media publicity for its four-day week in 2015. But Treehouse’s founder recently lamented that the working practice killed the work ethic in his company and called the experiment a “terrible thing”.The only way is down?Inidual “micro” trials are certainly useful, but they aren’t necessarily a reliable guide to “macro” economic impacts.The closest thing that we have to a state-mandated four-day week is France’s 35-hour week, introduced in 2000 under the Jacques Chirac-Lionel Jospin cohabitation.Jospin\u0026nbsp(left) and president Jaques Chirac (right) (AFPGetty)The first thing to bear in mind is that this does not mean all French people work a four-day week. The regulation simply means overtime kicks in after a worker has completed 35 hours and they accrue the right to holiday lieu days. Yet it does establish a social norm of fewer hours and a financial incentive for firms to limit them.Opinions are mixed about its results. France has a high unemployment rate relative to the UK and other developed countries and it’s notable that Emmanuel Macron campaigned for president promising to increase the flexibility of the system.And though the level of French productivity stands comparison with the most productive nations in the world, there’s no evidence that its growth rate has risen since it introduced the 35-hour week.This might incline us to scepticism about the value of the the state having any role in limiting working hours.\u0026nbspYet that could be the wrong conclusion. For the historic trend is clear. In the late 1900s, UK workers put in more than 2,500 hours a year on average. That’s down to 1,680 hours in 2017. There’s been a similar steep fall in other developed countries over the past century and a half.That reflects the fact that the five-day working week, as opposed to six days with only Sunday off, only become standard practice in the 20th century.It was the industrialist Henry Ford who was the pioneer in the US, giving his factory workers a five-day shift in 1926 while keeping their wages steady. This prefigured legislation and Congress’ 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandated a maximum 40-hour working week (effectively five working days).We primarily think of John Maynard Keynes as the great promoter of employment for his pioneering theories on the economic benefits of government-funded job creation during the Great Depression.\u0026nbspBut it was this secular decline in hours worked, despite the agonising surge in unemployment in the 1930s, that led Keynes to look forward to a 15-hour working week in The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren by the year 2000.The question is whether the recent flattening out is the end of the decline in hours worked,\u0026nbspor merely a pause.\u0026nbspAnd is a government nudge necessary to get history moving again?There’s also the question of consumption. One of the reasons Henry Ford instituted a five-day working week was revealed in a 1926 interview: “Leisure is an indispensable ingredient in a growing consumer market because working people need to have enough free time to find uses for consumer products, including automobiles.”In other words, it was less a paternalistic concern for his workers’ well-being\u0026nbspthan a recognition that it would create help create more customers for Ford.There’s an echo of this macroeconomic concern today, with government-linked Beijing researchers suggesting a four-day week could boost the domestic tourism and entertainment sectors and help rebalance the overall Chinese economy to consumption and away from excessive investment.But perhaps the major economic question about moving towards a four-day week is whether it\u0026nbspcould somehow boost our long-term productivity growth rate (perhaps by inducing more investment in automation by firms) or whether a shorter working week could only ever be the fruits of productivity growth with an origin elsewhere.The truth is that we don’t know the answer. Yet it’s vital to recognise that countries and societies have autonomy too, even now.\u0026nbspThe US has a considerably larger GDP per capita than any developed country in Europe. But the bulk of this gap is due not to a vastly higher level of productivity but the fact that Americans, on average, work many more hours than the French, Germans or Swiss or British and so on.The trade-off between work and leisure is different between our two continents. Both Europeans and Americans, by global and historical comparisons, have very comfortable standards of living. Choosing more leisure over extra working hours is not, whatever some might employers might argue, necessarily a route to penury and decline.Doing nothing for ever and everThe Victorian historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle believed in the redemptive power of work.“A man perfects himself by working,” he enthused. “Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities ... Even in the meanest sorts of labour, the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of real harmony the instant he sets himself to work.”The (possibly apocryphal) epitaph on a Hertfordshire gravestone took a different view of the intrinsic value of hard labour.“Here lies a poor woman who always was tired​”One does not need to be a Carlyle-style work zealot to appreciate that there is some intrinsic psychological value to labour. Work is where many of us find not just an income, but friends, stimulation and status. But we can also see where that Hertfordshire washerwoman was coming from.This dichotomy underlines that not all jobs are the same, or are experienced the same by the worker. For every occupation that that does help to clear away someone’s jungles of mental disorder there will be one that is felt as detestable drudgery.One of the deficiencies of the debate over the four-day week, as with discussions of the appropriate retirement age, is a failure to acknowledge the vast ersity of both jobs and workers. Labour is not homogeneous.Working until 70 might seem entirely reasonable, even desirable, to the university professor, the politician or the TV presenter. But to the cleaner, the firefighter or shop assistant – especially jobs with a physically arduous component – it may have considerably less appeal.\u0026nbspAnd so views erge too on the desirability of the four-day week.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chester Zoo after a fire broke out in the Monsoon Forest habitat area.Fracking has been halted at the Preston Road site in Lancashire after a series of tremors peaking at 0.9 magnitudeIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today told Theresa May that he expects assurances that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of IrelandTheresa May announces that she is to face a vote of no confidence todayArmed police restrain a man inside the grounds of the Houses of Parliament in LondonA demonstrator dressed as Theresa May sells Brexit Fudge in Old Palace Yard, WestminsterA pro-brexit demonstrator speaks into a megaphone at the Brexit betrayal march in London.

It was confirmed late on Sunday evening that the charismatic Thai chairman died alongside four other people in the crashGlenn Hoddle is taken to hospital after falling ill at the BT Sport studioOne of the most significant developments in the UK and broader Western economy over the past decade is the rise of the gig economy and self-employment. Around a sixth of the British workforce is now self-employed.This was brought home to me recently when I met the Romanian father of one of the friends of my young son. The father had been a chauffeur for a wealthy family in Chelsea. But he’d resigned after his son had started school and had signed on with Uber so he could pick his lad up directly from school and shift his driving work to airport shuttle-runs at night instead. “I wanted the flexibility and my previous employer couldn’t provide that,” he told me, as we watched our boys career around the playground.His work-life balance was not to be found in limiting the hours he worked (indeed he wanted to keep those the same or even increase them) but in the flexibility of his arrangements.Survey evidence suggests this is a common story. The majority of Uber drivers like the personal control over their working hours made possible by the platform. Drivers who valued flexible working reported higher levels of life satisfaction, as well as lower levels of anxiety.However, there was also a minority of Uber drivers who would prefer to work fixed hours in a more conventional work setting. And these workers reported lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety.A question of representationThis brings us back to the apparent paradox of many people in the UK workforce wanting fewer hours but many others wanting more.\u0026nbspDavid Bell, a labour market economist from the University of Stirling\u0026nbspwhose work, along with Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US, has highlighted this ergence, says that the groups who want fewer hours tend to be older, while those who are underemployed seem to be younger.One of the implications is that younger people in the workforce may need the money from more hours because they are under greater financial pressure, perhaps because they have families, or perhaps because they have suffered a greater real wage squeeze since the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThis suggests that Corbynite left is correct in stressing that to consider the economic and social case for a four-day in isolation is a mistake. Incomes plainly matter too, as well as the level of inequality.\u0026nbspOne has to consider the role of income redistribution and employment policies. Give people higher incomes and more “outside options” for employment, perhaps through a jobs guarantee or even a universal basic income, and the desire for extra hours in their current job may well melt away. They may begin to make different work-leisure trade-offs than they do now.Perhaps one of the reasons why we some people languish in ultra-flexible gig economy jobs they don’t appreciate – like those disgruntled Uber drivers – is that, despite what most economic analysts say, there is actually hidden slack in our economy – and that if the slack was eradicated they could find the kind of regular job they wanted elsewhere.But that still leaves a circle to be squared, presuming that different people, all else equal, are still likely to put different weights on work and leisure. How do we give those who would prefer a four-day week more freedom to choose it, while protecting the interests of those who don’t?The empowerment of ordinary workers is Professor Bell’s answer. Let inidual employees have substantive input into determining the trade-off, rather than leaving it up to politicians or employers.This is how I know the NHS won’t survive without EU staffOver a million young women say they’re paid less than male colleaguesDJ jailed for raping boy, 3, in toilet at working men’s clubTrailblazing images of early 20th-century working conditions“One of the things that might help is a strengthening of worker representation, which has declined so dramatically,” he says. “Rather than jumping in to impose a four-day week you want to think first about whether workers’ interests are being properly represented.”This would be going with the historical grain, given the driving role of new trade unions in the achievement of an eight-hour working day in the 19th century and early 20th century.It’s notable not only that IG Metall workers in Germany this year were able to achieve a four-day working week through negotiation with bosses – but that they also had sufficient bargaining power to protect their overall levels of weekly pay.A fundamental question that underpins this broad discussion about the future of working hours is a philosophical one: what makes us happy and fulfilled as human beings?Modern psychological studies do partially back up Carlyle’s Victorian pompous sermonising: formal work can be as positive for human happiness as leisure, sometimes more so.\u0026nbspA job does seem to bring a valuable sense of social usefulness. Involuntary unemployment is clearly harmful for people’s mental health.But how much work do we want or need? Keynes in the 1930s called this desire for work “old Adam” and predicted that three hours a day in the future would be “quite enough to satisfy” this inherited instinct.Perhaps the right thing to do is not to dictate to people, or engage in speculation on what the future of work will look like, but rather to help them decide for themselves.Four day working weekShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As a new book points out, it’s an essentially selfish state of being, and society should stop chasing this illusion because it’ll only make us miserable. Even if you do own an orgasmatron...Click to followThe IndependentSurfing is similar to happiness: it’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means it is devoid of any moralityThomas Jefferson made it a constitutional right in the US. “The pursuit of happiness.”\u0026nbspYou have the right to pursue wellbeing. No one is stopping you. Go ahead and pursue it. But when did a right morph into an obligation, a duty?The founding fathers were influenced by the great voyages of discovery. Thanks to Captain Cook and his French counterpart Bougainville, the idea got about that everyone in the southern hemisphere was happier than in the cold and dismal north. We had the technology, we had the “civilisation”, but why didn’t we feel good about it? They had something we were lacking. Surfing was a case in point. According to European observers, the men and women riding waves had found a way to “allay all perturbation of mind”. The American constitution was, in effect, suggesting we ought to try living our lives on the crest of a wave.I personally put the utopian theory to the test by following in Cook’s footsteps and going to the Sandwich Islands, aka Hawaii, aka “the Happy Isles of Oceania” (according to Paul Theroux). By a strange quirk of fate one of the first people I met there was a clinical psychologist. “Where are you from?”, she said. “England,” I replied. “You’re so lucky!” she said. I had just travelled several thousand miles to get away from England and here was someone telling me I was better off saving my money and staying put. “How do you work that out?” I asked. “The great thing about England,” she replied, “is that you can be miserable and nobody minds. In fact you’re expected to be miserable.”It turned out that she was a specialist in treating people with depression. “In Hawaii?” I said with genuine scepticism. They have palm trees, sultry breezes, and big waves, what was the problem? “People get depressed in Hawaii the same as anywhere else,” she said. “The problem is that here you’re expected to be happy. So you feel guilty about it on top. And then considering Hawaii is also technically the 50th state of America, if you’re broke too, when you’re supposed to be prosperous, then you’re really screwed.”You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for youDr Depression surely had a point. But she represents the opposition to what has become increasingly a vast and powerful and highly profitable industry, as Carl Cederström sets out in his wise and witty new book, The Happiness Fantasy. He might equally well have called it the “happiness conspiracy”, because we are being ganged up on, bullied and battered and bruised by the imperative of happiness. Can’t we just be unhappy if we feel like it? What’s so bad about that?I know I’m going to come over as the biggest party pooper, grouch or grinch in the history of the world here, but I can never really sing “Happy Birthday” to anyone with any degree of conviction or enthusiasm. I do still occasionally send birthday cards, but I’m not going to write the words “happy birthday” in black and white. It always seems too coercive to me. My attitude is OK, be happy if you like, but if you want to be unhappy that’s good too, you shouldn’t have to feel like you have to be happy. Happiness ought to be voluntary and accidental and spontaneous and strictly optional. (So what do I write? “Be awesome”? It’s tricky. Suggestions on a postcard, please.)TherouxCederström comes from Stockholm. He is more of an exponent of Nordic noir. No palm trees in Scandi-land, so far as I know. Only bracing, even lacerating minimalism. Don’t get me wrong. Cederström is not advocating despair. Maybe he is even trying to save you from Hawaiian-style depression. You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for you.According to Philip Larkin, sex was invented – or at least re-invented – sometime between the publication of Lady Chatterley’s Lover and the Beatles’ first LP, around 1963. “Happiness,” as Freud said, “comes from the satisfaction of needs that have been dammed up to a high degree.” But what if they are not dammed up? Then we are looking at futile or self-destructive overexertion. Instead of being an episodic phenomenon, sex turned into our lodestar, our archetype of mood-management. Thanks in part to Wilhelm Reich, the orgasm was no longer an exceptional high, it became the model of how we were ought to be feeling generally. Way up there on Cloud 9. Average was no longer good enough. But the idea that everyone should really be feeling well beyond average all the time – having constant “peak experiences” (in Abraham Maslow’s phrase) meant that there was always going to be lot of disappointed customers.Reich was an Austrian, originally a disciple of Freud’s, who broke with him over Freud’s notion of sublimation. Civilisation, said Freud, depends on you bottling up all that libinidal energy of yours, and channelling it into doing something creative, like writing novels, composing symphonies or building bridges and tall buildings. Rubbish, said Reich. The orgasm (no ordinary orgasm moreover, it has to be “full”) – that rapturous release of endorphins and assorted chemicals – is good for you. What we need is more actual orgasms. Thus was the Age of Aquarius born, ie the Sixties, marking an end to the long, grim era of repression. Reich invented the “orgone accumulator”, which became the “orgasmatron” in Woody Allen’s Sleeper. He was eventually arrested for fraud, locked up, and died in prison in the US, aged 60, a martyr to sexual liberationBut this was only the beginning of the happiness industry, branching out into “human potential”, “self-help”, “positive thinking”, and New Age gurus, even Scientology, all of them packaged and purveyed and pharmaceutically-inflected. If you’re feeling blue, why not pop a pill? It’s your constitutional right. Especially if it might make you more productive or more “authentic”. We have ended up in a situation where no one feels they are really getting enough, of just about anything. And we are “depraved on account of being deprived” as they say in West Side Story.Cederström is the co-author, with André Spicer, of The Wellness Syndrome, and together they wrote Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement. He puts me in mind of that bloke in Boswell’s Life of Johnson who says, “I tried to be a philosopher, but cheerfulness kept breaking through.” I couldn’t resist asking Cederström if he considered himself a happy sort of guy. He said that he thought the word itself was now effectively meaningless, as per the passage from Beckett’s Waiting for Godot:Godot, Alfred Lynch plays\u0026nbspEstragon (left) and Nicol Williamson is Vladimir (Rex)Vladimir: Say you are, even if it’s not true.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​What am I to say?Vladimir: Say, I am happy.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​We are happy. (Silence.) What do we do now, now that we are happy?\u0026nbspCederström reckons that “the whole self-actualisation craze had a purpose when it kicked off, in the Sixties, as a reaction against the hyper-patriarchal image of the happy family life with the ‘happy’ housewife and all the rest”. But he clearly thinks that the concept has long outlived its usefulness and is now being sold as a contemporary form of snake oil.The thing about happiness is that it should happen to you accidentally. You can only be happy until the moment where you start asking yourself the killer question, “Am I really happy?” And then it all falls apart. Hence all the hype and hysteria and desperation around happiness is entirely self-defeating. Happiness underwent a period of massive inflation in the 20th century. Maybe we have reached the point where the bottom has fallen out of the market finally and we need to rethink happiness from the ground up.I think the Greeks had a good idea in “ataraxia”. They didn’t think of the orgasm as the be-all and end-all. The point about ataraxia is that you are neither feeling particularly good nor particularly bad, but have attained a neutral state – a kind of degree zero – in which your desires give you a break for a time. Rather than maximum gratification we are looking at the minimisation of regret.As someone suggested to me the other day, happiness equals reality minus expectations. I think stoicism is superior to mere happiness because it allows that there is and there will be suffering in the world and the best you can hope for is to be able to adjust your attitude towards it. As Epicurus says, when you drop your favourite vase and it smashes into a thousand pieces no one expects you be jumping for joy. But you might be able (with a truly heroic effort) be able to say to yourself, “The vase has been restored.”The other problem with happiness is, oddly enough, the same problem that affects surfing. It’s an essentially selfish state of being. It’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means, in effect, that it is devoid of any morality. Harvey Weinstein was just trying to be happy too. Pursuing his democratic rights.We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they\u0026nbsparen’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone elseCarl Cederström sees Donald Trump as the ultimate flowering of the human potential movement. Even the president speaks of “tapping human potential”. Just as, at the same time, he speaks of “grabbing pussy” or celebrating the NRA. Happiness, as John Lennon said, “is a warm gun”. That’s my constitutional right too. Which has become practically synonymous with a lack of impulse control. I enjoy having a drink, don’t I? Or a big fat cheeseburger. So isn’t it my right to go on eating and drinking myself to death? I want to feel good, even if that way perdition lies (not to mention diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver). As the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman once said (before OD’ing on heroin), “There is no pleasure I haven’t actually made myself sick on.” Cederström himself recalls anything but fondly a week of limitless hedonistic excess in the Canary Islands, leading to an all-time hangover.Happiness, in any case, is largely an illusion. We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they aren’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone else. Social media only serves to spread the delusion. I once asked my son, who was supposed to be studying at university at the time, if his life was constant partying. “Why would you think that?” He asked. “Because all I see of you on Facebook is pictures of you dancing or getting drunk at parties.” He scoffed at my naivety. “That’s only because no one ever posts pictures of themselves sitting at the library and reading a book or writing an essay.”Happiness is a myth that only serves the interests of the happiness-conjurors and the manufacturers of birthday cards. I think happiness has now entered its twilight zone. I can’t see feeling good being of any intrinsic value unless it is also coupled to doing good. Aristotle had something like this in mind when he defined happiness (or eudaimonia) as leading a virtuous life. I think this is what Cederström is hoping for in the future when he speaks of “collective happiness”.But there is another issue here: just as happiness can dissolve into a kind of self-satisfaction, having one’s fellow humans in mind is only another kind of narcissism at the level of the species. One of the most ecstatic non-anthropocentric moments I can recall is when I was cycling through a park and a small bird – a sparrow, I think – came flying out of a bush straight out at me, but seeing me in the way, turned at right angles so that – for the space of a second or two – the bird was flying at exactly the height of my head and at the same speed I was cycling. With the effect that we (if I can speak of “we”, the bird and me) briefly flew along together. That was years ago and I can still feel something of what it must feel like to be a bird. It was exceptional and aleatory and probably unrepeatable. But perhaps the oceanic feeling that Freud was so sceptical of – the sense of there being “an indissoluble bond” with the universe – needs to make a comeback.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’Carl Cederström’s book, ‘The Happiness Fantasy’, is published by PolityShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That comes as a free game that is available to players who subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online, which now requires a fee.New version of Nintendo Switch could come next year, report claimsLast year, Nintendo unveiled that it would revive the NES Classic – making many more them after they had initially quickly sold out. That gave hope to fans who longed for the consoles to stick around, and for new games or consoles to be released as well.But Mr\u0026nbspFils-Aime\u0026nbspsaid that the existing two consoles represent extent of our classic program. That suggests there will be no extra consoles, such as the Nintendo 64, which fans have continuously asked Nintendo to reduce into its own miniature system and rumours had suggested may be on its way.And he also ruled out new additions to the Classic consoles\u0027 line-up of games. There\u0027s no ability for add-on content with our classic consoles, so when you purchase the console it’s coming with that set roster of content, he said.But he did point out that new games have been added to the Switch\u0027s set of NES games, suggesting more might come through that service.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Radicals, on the other hand, held onto their initial decision even after seeing evidence suggesting it was incorrect.While the researchers were confident their results stood up to scrutiny, having replicated them in two sets of people, their task only explained some of the radicalism on show.“We suspect that this is because the task is completely unrelated to politics – people may be even more unwilling to admit to being wrong if politics had come into play,” said PhD student Max Rollwage.One conclusion they drew from their study, published in the journal Current Biology, was that the failure of metacognition held true across the political spectrum.\u0026nbspThey said this suggested radicalism was based on a way of thinking that “transcends political inclinations”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Children can’t escape the poverty trap without an urgent change to national policies.”Young Women’s Trust chief executive Dr Carole Easton said: “Christmas is a particularly hard time for those on low pay who want to provide for their families.“Young women are more likely to be stuck on low pay and on zero hours contracts. Often they don’t know how many hours they will work each month and whether they will earn enough to pay their bills.\u0026nbsp“Much more needs to be done to improve young people’s prospects.

long-expected post-Brexit immigration plan will have no reference to the Conservative manifesto pledge to reduce net migration down to the “tens of thousands”.Whitehall sources confirmed to The Independent that the target long-championed by Theresa May as home secretary and prime minister does not appear anywhere in the document.The target will still exist as a manifesto pledge until the next election at least, but its absence is a clear sign policy has now moved away from the numbers-based approach backed by Ms May.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPublication of the white paper was pencilled in for Wednesday but is yet to be confirmed,\u0026nbspamid reports that Ms May is at odds with ministers over her desire to frame the new system as an immigration crackdown.Instead there is a push for the government’s new approach\u0026nbspto be positively framed as a system serving the skills needs of the UK economy as it leaves the EU.May attempts to quash calls for a Final Say Brexit referendumThe news is a victory for The Independent’s Drop the Target campaign, launched back in April 2017 with Open Britain, to see the blunt policy ditched.The writing has been on the wall for the target – set out in Tory manifestos from 2010, 2015 and last year – since Ms May’s authority was critically weakened after losing her party’s majority at the 2017 election.Several ministers have indicated they do not fully support it, including home secretary Sajid Javid, his predecessor Amber Rudd, now pensions secretary, and international trade secretary Liam Fox.Discussing the white paper, a Whitehall source said of the target: “It’s not in there, and it won’t be unless someone slips it in at the last minute.”Instead the paper will talk about reducing migration to “sustainable levels”, a phrase used recently in an interview by Mr Javid, who has also distanced himself from the “hostile environment” policies once backed by Ms May.People want to end free movement, and the document does talk about reducing net migration to sustainable levels, but it’s more about what that will actually look likeA leak to The Sunday Times at the weekend focussed on potential reductions of numbers in EU migrants that the plan would bring.But The Independent’s source explained that the new system was a “clear step towards changing the shape of the immigration debate away from numbers and towards an approach that ensures the UK has the skills it needs”.“People want to end free movement, and the document does talk about reducing net migration to sustainable levels, but it’s more about what that will actually look like,” the source\u0026nbspadded.The process of pushing the immigration white paper through has been arduous, requiring approval from a number of departments\u0026nbspincluding the Treasury and the Department for Business, run by Philip Hammond and Greg Clark respectively – both who have prioritised reducing the impact of Brexit on the economy.Created with Sketch.Pride and prejudice: The Victorian roots of a very British ambivalence to immigration Show all 3Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Elements of the plan to have already appeared in the press indicate there will be no cap on highly skilled migrants from anywhere in the world.Medium-skilled migrants will be allowed in if they have a job paying at least £30,000 a year, but migrants with skills Britain needs will be granted visas on a lower salary.Low-skilled workers will get short-term visas of up to a year if they are from a country that is a “low risk of immigration abuse”, while students will be granted six months of study leave and can switch to a skilled worker’s visa three months before the end of their course.Ms May championed the target when she was running the Home Office and fought battles with then-chancellor George Osborne, who was pushing for it to be lifted.At the time The Independent launched its campaign to ditch the target, Ms May’s allies were certain it would be retained in a post-Brexit plan, saying it was “unfinished business” from her six years at the Home Office.But the departure from the target now marks the decline in Ms May’s authority, with her pledging only last week that she would not lead the Conservatives into the 2022 election, as she fought to save her job in the face of a backbench coup.As well as Mr Javid, Ms Rudd also refused to endorse the tens of thousands target while at the Home Office, while Mr Fox said in August that the target was in place “at the moment”, but the government needed to “look” at how it shaped its immigration policy in the future.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereDrop the TargetShare your

Jeremy has taken the sense of the House of Commons which is clearly demanding a vote this week. Fair enough, we’re now going for it.”Announcing he was tabling a motion of no confidence, Jeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspcriticised Theresa\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbspfor not offering MPs a chance to have their say before Christmas, amid expectations the vote will take place in the week beginning January 14.The vote on the Brexit deal was originally scheduled for December 11 before Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbsppostponed it due to a lack of support amid concerns over the Irish border backstop.Raising a point of order in the Commons, Mr Corbyn said: It\u0027s very clear that it\u0027s bad, unacceptable, that we should be waiting almost a month before we have a meaningful vote on the crucial issue facing the future of this country.The Prime Minister has obdurately refused to ensure a vote took place on the date she agreed, she refuses to allow a vote to take place this week and is now, I assume, thinking the vote will be on January 14 - almost a month away.This is unacceptable in any way whatsoever.So, as the only way I can think of ensuring a vote takes place this week, I\u0027m about to table a motion which says the following: \u0027That this House has no confidence in the Prime Minister due to her failure to allow the House of Commons to have a meaningful vote straight away on the Withdrawal Agreement and framework for future relationships between the UK and European Union.\u0027That will be tabled immediately, Mr Speaker.Mr Corbyn\u0026nbspcalled for the vote after Ms May\u0026nbspannounced Parliament would not vote on Britain\u0027s orce deal with the European Union until the week of January 14, more than a month after it was originally scheduled.\u0026nbspDefeat in a no confidence motion would increase pressure on the prime minister. But unlike a no-confidence motion in the government, a vote on Ms May\u0026nbspas an inidual has no power to topple the government and force an election.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn’s motion will say,\u0026nbsp“that this House has no confidence in the Prime Minister due to her failure to allow the House of Commons to have a meaningful vote straight away on the withdrawal agreement and framework for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.”Jeremy Corbyn has tabled a motion of no confidence in Theresa May as PMEarlier, Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0026nbspcongratulated Mrs May on winning the confidence of the Conservatives in this House last week, adding that he wanted to assure her that she therefore commands my confidence too.He said he did not back another referendum, saying it was better known as the losers\u0027 vote, saying that it would be undemocratic and isive.The prominent backbencher added: But also because it would be very hard to deny a second referendum in Scotland, if we had a second referendum on membership of the European Union.She thanked him for his support, adding that the UK has accepted the decision we have taken in numerous referendums over the decades and not gone back to the people.Theresa May has refuted reports that she has been receiving advice from former PM David Cameron over Brexit.Responding to a question from Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, she said: He is not giving advice, the last time I spoke to him was when we actually agreed the withdrawal agreement, when I spoke to two former prime ministers as a matter of courtesy to indicate to them what had been negotiated with the European Union.Back in the Commons, Labour’s\u0026nbspCatherine West\u0026nbspasks the PM whether she has any advice for a constituent who is stockpiling insulin in case there is a no-deal Brexit.Ms May says the Department of Health is making preparations to ensure\u0026nbspsupplies of medicines continue.Leaving Brexit for a moment, my colleague Rob Merrick has written a piece on the latest Windrush findings.\u0026nbspThree\u0026nbspvictims of the scandal have been flown back to Britain to live from\u0026nbspJamaica after being given “exceptional” help, the home secretary has revealed – as he again delayed a full compensation scheme.\u0026nbspMore here:\u0026nbspTory Anna Soubry says there is consensus in the country that this is an unholy mess. She says the people would never forget or forgive the government or the Conservative party if they are taken out on bad terms.\u0026nbspMay says the people voted for Brexit and MPs voted to trigger Article 50, which leads to leaving the EU.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

So where is he and whats he up to now David Cameron is back at home writing his memoirs, no longer playing a role in Westminster.According to a friend, Cameron fancies being Foreign Secretary in the next government.The Suns sources: David is dedicated to public service, and has often said he wouldn’t rule out a public role one day, domestically or internationally.“But he is only , and still a young man.”The Camerons have properties in the Cotswolds and in Cornwall.Their lavish Cotswolds cottage cost a reported £.m, while their Cornwall getaway was bought for £million last year.They also own a London home in Notting Hill.They reportedly took out a mortgage on the home just days before the EU referendum.Apart from writing his memoirs, Cameron is advising Theresa May on how to break the Brexit deadlock, it has emerged.The former PM has lobbied Mrs May to put a string of dferent options to a vote in Parliament.He has teamed up with at least eight Cabinet ministers to argue for so-called indicative votes in the House of Commons.Mr Cameron told the PM she should get on with getting Parliament to work through the options, according to ITV.Quizzed on their talks today, the Prime Minister said: He is not giving advice - the last time I spoke to him was when we actually agreed the withdrawal agreement.Some ministers want Mrs May to bring her Brexit deal to the Commons this week - knowing it will be voted down.Mr Cameron has publicly supported the current deal, but its understood his priority is to avoid a No Deal outcome.He had also been due to publish his memoirs in autumn  but decided to wait until September  “to avoid his comments on Brexit undermining Britain’s crunch negotiations with the EU”, according to The Sunday Times.Cameron has enjoyed trips to Glastonbury festival, chowed down on some fish and chips at Polzeath Beach in Cornwall and sported a Peaky Blinders flat cap at the races.He has also been giving advice to we Samanthas designer clothing business.Aside from writing his memoirs, Cameron has also been involved in overseeing the expansion of the National Citizen Service , the skills programme for teenagers he set up while in power, as chairman of NCS Patrons.The scheme is open to young people aged between  and  and involves outdoor activity trips, where young people learn le skills and plan and fundraise for social action projects.Cameron will bring together politicians from all parties, as well as industry experts, to help it reach more teenagers.As well as being on the board of several other organisations, the rest of his time is taken up predominantly with the UK-China Fund, which he has vice-chaired since December .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there’s still more to do.I welcome The Sun’s campaign for more help for Universal Credit and urge ministers to do more to aid those in society who need it the most.He said the extra money pumped in from the Budget was “helping an enormous amount” but there’s still further to go to ensure the system works for everyone.And he called on ministers to make sure that help for vulnerable Brits when moving over onto Universal Credit is properly funded.Now that stage one of the rollout is complete, ministers must make sure Universal Support programme to help Brits with their applications and debt problems is properly funded so we can identy people who have problems and get them help as soon as possible.And ex-DWP boss Damian Green said that reducing the taper rate further would help Brits.He told The Sun: Universal Credit is a great system which helps people into work, and allows them to increase their hours of work without benefit problems. A few important changes would make it an even better system, and I hope we can make them in the coming years. I was delighted to reduce the taper rate in , and would like this taken further.Frank Field MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, also congratulated The Sun on its campaign.He said: My constituents, and hard-up families across the country, need the government to change its position quickly.There is a whole series of problems the government must fix to make Universal Credit work.Closing the yawning gap of five weeks for the first payment, making it pay to get a job and put in more hours, and offering proper support for childcare so parents can get in to work are three important places to start.And Tory rising star Johnny Mercer, MP for Plymouth Moor View, said the party had to make sure they were there for people in their time of need.He told The Sun: “The British people support and understand the need for welfare reform, of that I have no doubt.Butthere are too many stories, too many people being seriously disadvantaged or not looked after in their hour of need, we will not win this argument, and the country will be the poorer for it.I urge the Treasury and the Prime Minister to reinvest the money originally committed for universal credit and make it the defining policy of a modern compassionate Conservative party it deserves to be.While charities including Child Poverty Action Group, Save the Children, Joseph Rowntree Foundation and TurnUs also backed our calls.Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, said: “Three cheers for The Sun’s brilliant campaign to stand up for hard-working families.“The Government must change the system before even more families are pushed into the red as they wait for support.”One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Labour’s Shadow Treasury Minister Anneliese Dodds said more changes to Universal Credit were vital.She said: “This Christmas many people are facing insecurity and hardship as a result of the Government’s failed roll out of Universal Credit.“The Sun is absolutely right to campaign for changes to Universal Credit, including cutting the waiting time for payment, but the roll out must be stopped first.“Universal Credit was meant to lt people out of poverty, but all too often it is pushing people into debt, rent arrears and leaving them at risk of destitution.“Labour will stop the roll out of Universal Credit and ensure that we have a social security system that is there for any of us when we need it.”The Liberal Democrats and the SNP also backed our call.Ex Lib Dem boss Tim Farron said: “Instead of fixing the many obvious problems with Universal Credit, the Conservatives have put ideology ahead of evidence and allowed the benefit to become a new poll tax.“The Liberal Democrats strongly support The Sun’s campaign to salvage Universal Credit by cutting its unnecessarily long waiting times and enabling people to keep more of what they earn.”Ruth George MP for High Peak : “None of us want to live in a country where children go hungry, families have to visit food banks, and more people homeless on our streets - just some of the consequences of the disastrous cuts to Universal Credit. Well done The Sun for this campaign. I hope that by all coming together, we can change this cruel policy before another  million households are affected.”Stephen Lloyd MP for Eastbournesaid: I am delighted The Sun are launching this campaign to bring fairness into the governments flagship Universal Credit program. With over ,, people, many of whom in employment, being moved onto Universal Credit over the next couple of years it is vital the government pull out all the stops to ensure it succeeds. Speeding up payments to recipients and making sure those in low-income jobs earn more than they wouldthey were unemployed and on benefit, would make a signicant and positive dference. Common sense from our soaraway Sun. Robert Halfon, Tory MP for Harlowsaid: I am backing the Suns campaign because the Department for Work and Pensions must stand up for making work pay. The defining mission of our Government has to be to help hard working and lower income people who are doing the right thing. They deserve a fair days pay for a fair days work, without needing to worry that the benefits they rely on will be taken away, keeping them in the poverty trap and making it affordable to work. I welcome the extra funding that the Government gave to Universal Credit in the Budget but they need to do more and fast.  Lord John Birdsaid: “By processing Universal Credit payments faster, and by making families childcare payments upfront, the Government has an opportunity to show that its listening to the concerns of struggling people and that it wants to make its flagship welfare programme work.”Ronnie Campbell, MP for Blyth Valley,said: “I support the campaign”.Geraint Davies, MP for Swansea West,said: “In Swansea families wait cold and hungry for their first universal credit payment only to find its been hammered by tax because of a punitive earning threshold. Job Centres are so tied up with claimants needing help with applications that they aren’t able to help people find a job. So more people are using foodbanks and run up debts. That’s why I support the Sun’s campaign to make payments faster and fairer for those most in need.”Liam Byrne, MP for Birmingham, Hodge Hill,said: “Universal credit has turned into a punishment beating for thousands of our neighbours whose only crime is to be low-paid, poor or disabled. We are the fth richest country on earth. It is simply inexcusable for an arm of government to be forcing people to go without and so I fully support The Suns campaign to get these changes made before this careless policy hurts even more families.”Bob Blackman MP for Harrow East,said: “I support the policy that is Universal Credit and its reformist core: replacing six complex benefits with a single unied system.What I am concerned about is ensuring it is properly funded and I have lobbied ministers on this point.Another concern of mine, and one which is covered by this campaign, is ensuring claimants are paid in good time.I am pleased to be supporting this campaign.Nik Dakin, MP for Scunthorpe,said: “I support the campaign to make Universal Credit work for people and families.  That means cutting the time people have to wait to get their money so they don’t have to rely on foodbanks to feed their families.  Parents should get more of their money upfront instead of being paid in arrears.”Rushanara Ali, MP for Bethnal Green and Bow,said: “The Government is in complete denial over the problems with Universal Credit. This programme is pushing millions of families into poverty, causing a rise in homelessness, debt and a % increase in foodbank use.  “This policy disproportionately hurts women, people with disabilities and those from ethnic minorities. It is sickening that the government will limit and delay funds for those who need it most.“A particularly cruel part of the Universal Credit welfare reform is the ‘two-child limit’ policy, which limits the level of financial support to low-income families with more than two children, which, ultimately punishes children.”Yvonne Fogue, MP for Makerfield,said:  A social security system that increases poverty rather than alleviating it isn’t worthy of the name. Which is why I support the need to make vital changes to Universal Credit.  Late payments and underpayments are propelling our most vulnerable citizens into the arms of unscrupulous payday lenders and must end.Steve McCabe, MP for Birmingham Selly Oak,said: “Universal Credit was meant to simply the benefits system, help people find employment and make work pay. Unsurprisingly this government has made a shambles of it and what we are actually seeing is millions of people pushed into debt and into the arms of loan sharks because they are forced to wait over a month to receive their first payment. Government cuts mean that working people are actually worse off under Universal Credit than they were before and families are telling me there are facing late payment fees from their nursery because of problems with the Universal credit childcare payments. How is this fair I am calling on the new Secretary of State to urgently review the system and make the necessary changes so my constituents aren’t faced between the prospect of heating or eating this Christmas.SNP Work and Pensions spokesperson Neil Gray added: “The UK government’s appalling Universal Credit system is pushing households into hardship, debt and a reliance on emergency support including foodbanks as the welfare system is just not there for them when they need it.“The SNP have demanded the UK Government make these changes since the early stages of rollout and any campaign to put these wrongs right deserves support from political parties across the spectrum.The Government must listen to the calls of the public, charities, parliaments, and newspapers - including this campaign by The Sun - to fix Universal Credit once and for all.”And charities helping struggling Brits on Universal Credit also demanded ministers sit up and take notice of The Suns campaign.Chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group Alison Garnham said: “Universal credit isn’t fit for families or ready for further roll-out.“The Sun’s ideas for fixing Universal Credit are spot on - they’re based in the real world where people don’t have money to tide them over for five weeks before their first payment or extra cash for paying childcare fees upfront.“We hope that ministers will act on The Sun’s campaign and take steps to put things right.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she welcomed the input of Sun readers to the debate on Universal Credit.She said: Universal Credit has helped people into work, giving them the confidence of a pay packet and boosting their self-esteem.In my first few weeks at the Department I’ve seen what a force for good Universal Credit can be.However I know that there are problems, and I am committed to tackling those issues.We need to build on what Universal Credit already delivers, ensuring that we do even more to look after families and claimants who need us.And I very much welcome the input of Sun readers as I do this.Alison Taylor, from TurnUs, said: “We fully support the Sun’s campaign to improve Universal Credit.“We have seen people who have been pushed into housing and fuel arrears and struggling to cover everyday essentials by having to wait a minimum of five weeks for their entitlement.“Reducing this to two weeks could drastically improve the financial and emotional wellbeing of iniduals and families.”Brendan Sarsfield, chief executive of housing association Peabody, said: “Universal Credit isn’t working yet. The principle is right, but in practice it’s causing real hardship for people on low incomes. “We know that faster payments, upfront support with childcare costs, and letting people keep more of their wages before losing benefits would transform lives and offer a route out of poverty. “That’s why Peabody is backing the Sun’s campaign to Make Universal Credit Work.”Lucie Russell, Director, Fair By Design, and co-founder of the Big Issue: “The bottom line is that Universal Credit is just not up to scratch. This is causing hardship and distress to millions of people around the country. We support the Sun’s calls for an urgent change in the Universal Credit system, so that being poor stops costing more.” Rosie Fergusson, Chief Executive, Gingerbread: “Universal Credit isn’t working for single parents like Jess, who is on a zero-hours contract and finding it dficult to pay the nursery fees upfront. It doesn’t need to be this way. We will continue to press for change to make Universal Credit work for people like Jess.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000424156981.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu choosing not to give pm what she needs","story":"This is not just The Sun’s view. Former EU leaders are imploring their successors to see sense.Ex-Commission President José Manuel Barroso says: “If there’s political will the excellent lawyers of the EU can find a creative solution for the backstop.“It is crucial to avoid resentment. I hope the EU council understands it. There will be no third country more important than the UK.”His predecessor Romano Prodi has also said the EU could give ground.But it will take more than vague promises. Our power to exit the Irish backstop has to be legally binding — and approved by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.It seems vanishingly unlikely. But it’s the one thing that could yet see Mrs May’s deal rise like Lazarus from the dead.PHILIP Hammond’s “extremists” jibe at Brexit-supporting Tory backbenchers was reckless and stupid.If anything is likely to hasten a catastrophic split in the Tories it’s the Chancellor of a minority Government declaring war on scores of his own MPs. But it also displayed staggering ­contempt for politicians committed to honouring the referendum and the election manesto on which they stood.Politics has been debased by charlatans making promises they dump as soon as it’s convenient. It is in a critical stateNOT doing so is “extreme”.If there are extremists in Parliament besides the obvious, Corbyn and McDonnell, it is those playing roulette with national stability by attempting to stage a second referendum before the verdict of the first is carried out.It is incredible that it is considered mainstream, noble even, of these MPs to renege on promises they made and votes they cast — and to refuse to honour the majority’s will because the losing minority must have their “final say”.All while performing intellectual ­contortions to justy what, deep down, they know is unjustiable: imposing their will over the public’s. That is a far more extreme position than anything on the Tory backbenches.“Everyone knows who won,” says ­Benedict Cumberbatch in the trailer for Channel ’s upcoming Brexit movie.We do. Some MPs have forgotten.FOR  years The Sun has cheered on Britain’s forces at our Millies spectacular.We hope we did them proud again last night.

They need to do far more when it comes to outreach, actually visiting isolated and deprived areas and talking to children years before they start thinking about university.Otherwise, a child growing up in a community where very few people have a degree will believe university just isn’t for them.The top universities all have their own outreach policies, and don’t work together to reach particularly under-represented parts of the country, which means entire towns can often end up being ignored.The political world doesn’t help, either. A young, white, working-class boy might not think he fits into the current Parliament, and so a vicious cycle of the same sort of people from the same sort of backgrounds going into politics continues. We know all the figures about the percentage of MPs who went to private schools , or that  prime ministers were schooled at Eton.But what we are less likely to realise is that there are entire towns in this country that have never, ever had an MP who was born and schooled locally.Or that the cost of getting into politics means thatyou are from a working-class background, your only hope of becoming an MP is landing a well-paid job first. And that tends to be easieryou’ve been to university.MPs tend to recruit their researchers straight from university. Researchers go on to become special advisers or take other political jobs before becoming MPs, so the political gene pool is articially shallow from the beginning.It’s handy to have MPs who hail from all kinds of backgrounds, but especially useful to have people who grew up in tough circumstances.When governments make mistakes, it is usually the most vulnerable people who suffer first. A Parliament of old Etonians can’t always instinctively realise when a policy is going to cause trouble.I don’t need to tell you that the current Parliament isn’t working very well.From those at the top of government who have failed to take big decisions on Brexit, to the backbenchers who have been busy plotting away, a lot of people in Westminster seem to be lacking a sense of perspective.This week the drama has all been about Brexit, but the infighting means that serious policy problems on social care, domestic abuse and, yes, education are largely ignored.If we made it easier for any bright kid from any background to get to university, perhaps we would have more competition for Parliamentary seats — and end up with better politicians.SoDamian Hinds got his way with universities, he’d be putting the future mediocre politicians out of a job.There might even be entire weeks in politics when you’d have a chance of noticing comments made by the Education Secretary, rather than being distracted by the self-indulgent way in which politicians of all persuasions have ended up conducting themselves.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was am in a country town so there was nowhere open to spend it.I think it was a combination of being tipsy and bored, but I just kept doing it again and again, it was like a magic trick.”Waking the next day, Dan thought he had dreamt it - but the money was still in his wallet.“Being able to withdraw hundreds with the stroke of a key was a very addictive thing - I felt like a caveman discovering fire, he says.Dan went back the next night, and worked out that by visiting the ATM between midnight and AM he could withdraw as much cash as he wanted because the cash machine wasnt connected to the server.The charges would appear on his account as minus figures the next day, but that wouldnt stop him being able to draw out more cash once the clock struck midnight.Alarmingly, his bank didnt notice.The bank would just ask: Did you just go here  Did you just go there  And I’d say: “Yeah, that’s me” and then they’d say No worries just checking it’s you. It was truly bizarre.I just resolved to keep going until the bank put a stop to it, but they never did, he said.Dan started drawing out hundreds of pounds a night, splashing it on drinks for everyone in his local pub.He worked outhe went to the same ATM between am and am he could steal as much money as he liked.He started eating out at the best restaurants in his town and throwing wild parties every weekend.Despite carelessly withdrawing more and more money in the early hours, within just a few weeks Dan became increasingly aware that his bank balance was getting further and further into the red - though the bank still never contacted him.Panicking, he started trying to “win” the money back by gambling.Within a matter of weeks he fired for gambling on the job and his girlfriend dumped him.But Dan was already used to living the high le - and a relationship breakdown and losing his job wasnt going to stop him enjoying himself.“People who think youve got money they treat you dferently, he says.Especially with the opposite sex, it attracts people.Dan previously admitted to paying for glamorous escorts to walk on his arm.Saunders’ le quickly became like a movie, with raucous parties, private jets, call girls, plush hotels, Beluga caviar and Hugo Boss suits becoming routine.He also paid off some of his friends’ university tuition fees and sent a mate to study in France.Most of Saunders’ mates didn’t believe his story about the ATM hack - and the bank didnt notice either.He kept it secret from his straight-laced family, and told strangers he was an investment banker or working in real estate.The most expensive thing Saunders bought was a flight in -seat private jet, which he chartered with his mates to an island in Asia, near Bali, which set him back almost £,.“I couldnt tell you exactly where it was, but I didnt need a passport to get there.We were in the air for about three hours and had filled the plane up with people.It was a mix of old friends and new faces. We hired the whole resort, the over-water villas and ate and drank there.“I opened the book on anything – people just gave me their dreams and I fulfilled them.”Saunders once hired a minibus, stopping at all the backpacker hostels in Melbourne picking up people. He then drove them out to a big estate he hired out in the stunning Yarra Valley where he hosted pool parties.But it all turned sour later on. Saunders started having anxiety attacks and began to get scared about being caught.“I think there was a small part of me wanted it to end but I was past the point of no , my le had changed dramatically, he says.He often dreamt about being caught.“One night I had a nightmare that the SWAT team was out the front of the hotel room I was staying in, he recalls.I remember waking up in a pool full of sweat, realising that it was just a dream and then hotel doorbell rang. I was like thats it, Im gone. Theyre coming to get me, which actually would have been a relief – but it turned out to be the maid askingId like fresh towels.Two years passed and Saunders was finding it hard to come to terms with his overnight riches, so he started seeing psychologists.The first one Saunders saw freaked out, saying she wasn’t qualied to help him.The second said he should turn himself in to clear his conscience.Saunders had never contacted the police, but he stopped working the glitch and once hed blown all the money he contacted the bank in June .They said that the police would get in touch with him about it - but they never did. Dan even appeared on a national news programme detailing his lestyle.He went to several small local newspapers with his story and gave a video interview on Australian news programme, The Current Affair.Still, it was three years before Saunders was arrested on  counts related to fraud and theft.Dan says: The court case was weird because no one actually understood what I did: not the judge, not the prosecutor, it was very odd.There were many blank looks the bank provided minimal evidence so it was really just a case of bad Dan and that’s it....case closed.“They even played the Current Affair interview in the court room as evidence. It was surreal.I just sat back and pleaded guilty and sort of let it all unfold in front of me.It was the oddest set of circumstances I have ever witnessed.In May , Saunders left jail after spending a year in prison. He’s now working in a bar again on £. an hour.He tells Sun Online: Right now, Im happy. Ive got a pretty stable le with a bit of everything here and there.Its better now, but there was definitely a hangover time, when I thought, jeez, maybe I should have gone to Spain after all.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Who thinks we could get all the benefits without paying a penny Imagine asking to use a gym but refusing to join or even pay – and wanting a say in how it’s run!Let’s face facts: the EU isn’t waiting to give a dferent Prime Minister a better deal. Whether it’s Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, they won’t roll over and give us everything we want.It’s not only Theresa May who says it. Nor even just Juncker. Merkel says the deal can’t be changed.Macron and Ireland’s Taoiseach say so too. Not one EU leader said they are open to renegotiating it.In , % of Labour constituencies voted for Brexit. Labour heartlands like Sunderland, Hartlepool, Bolsover, Wakefield or Doncaster all voted leave. Here in the West Midlands, people voted to leave in some of the highest numbers of all.In , our manesto promised to uphold the referendum – no s, no buts, no second referendum.Ordinary, decent people who voted leave believed us. Lots of people voted leave to make politicians sit up and listen.With trust in politics at an all-time low, we can’t discount that lightly. Another referendum would take months and there’s no agreement on what the questions would be.I’ve listened to lots of people in Dudley and there’s not much evidence people have changed their minds. Eventhey had, who thinks a narrow remain vote would settle it That’s why I think our choice is between Theresa May’s deal or leaving with no deal at all. I joined the Labour Party to fight for ordinary people and their jobs must come first.This week I met Jaguar Land Rover, a world-beating British company employing , British workers.Like manufacturers up and down the country they believe a no deal Brexit would threaten their business and the jobs of people who depend on it.Delays at ports will cost jobs. Thousands of parts go into every car – some cross the channel several times before the car is complete.They all have to arrive at plants in the Midlands or on Merseyside at exactly the right moment and in the right order. Half the parts for cars made in Britain typically come from Europe.It would be greatthey were made here, but that can’t happen quickly. Worse, the supply chain that has grown up here in the last decade could decide to leavewe get the wrong deal.Leaving on WTO terms would also put people out of work too because tarfs would increase the price of cars built in Britain and sold in Europe by ten per cent.Theresa May’s deal isn’t perfect but is still our best option in front of us to protect jobs, keep employment and environmental standards, deliver a fair immigration system and safeguard border arrangements in Ireland.For all its flaws, the Brexit deal meets these priorities.It commits to maintain ‘high standards of free and fair trade and workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protection’, and a level playing-field on regulations.And it ensures that there is no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.There will never be a perfect deal. Butwe want to avoid trust in politics being damaged even more, andwe want to protect jobs and standards, we must think long and hard before rejecting the only deal on offer.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And  per cent said it happens in EVERY lesson.Some  per cent of teachers told Policy Exchange that mobile use in schools was now “serious or very serious”.It said poor pupil behaviour in general was now becoming so bad two-thirds of teachers had thought about quitting the profession.They added it was affecting the quality of education kids receive.Dr Joanna Williams, Policy Exchange’s head of education, said schools had to confront the issue of phones far “more seriously” – and apply rules consistently.She said: “Persistent disruption interrupts teaching and prevents pupils from learning effectively.“Inappropriate mobile phone use disrupts teaching and learning and so it is appalling that  per cent of teachers are having to deal with this at least once a week.”Almost two thirds are considering — or have considered — leaving due to unruly children.Dr Joanna Williams, who prepared the report for the Policy Exchange, said: “We need a cultural sht where high standards of behaviour are assumed to be the norm.”It polled  secondary school teachers, , parents and , pupils.France this summer announced a ban on smartphones or smart devices in schools for kids aged between  and  to “protect children”.In October, Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he backs schools that ban mobile phones from the classroom.But he said headteachers were the best placed to decide whether or not to do so. A poll last month found three-quarters of parents want a similar ban here.The number one reason was distraction, followed by bullying and a lack of social skills.The Policy Exchange report said that, overall, three-quarters of teachers experience poor behaviour by pupils in their own school.And almost two-thirds –  per cent – have considered leaving their job because of the disruption.Mr Hinds said the Government had already pledged £million for schools so they could share best practice on “behaviour management”.He added: “We now need all schools to follow the best performing so that can build on the rising standards in our schools.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’ve faced much bigger challenges in our history.”It was a shrewd move by the ambitious Foreign Secretary.  Leaving the EU without a deal has suddenly become a hot favourite with Brexit leadership rivals. It is also the outcome feared most in the capitals of Europe.The German official’s response is shocking proof that Theresa May’s mantra: “No Deal is better than a Bad Deal” was always seen as an empty bluff.It also refutes the claim that her widely-loathed withdrawal plan is the only option available from Brussels. Mr Hunt brushed aside Project Fear’s portrayal of a “Car Crash” Brexit and insisted Britain can cope with all challenges.“We shouldn’t pretend there won’t be disruption,” he admitted. “That’s why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary.”Far from the clf-edge, car-crash nightmare painted by the Treasury, BBC and CBI, a clean Brexit is entirely manageable. It would set us free to trade on terms set by the Government in the interests of the British people.We would save the £billion ransom to Brussels — and use some of the cash to buy time from the EU for more detailed planning. And it would see off slippery Tony Blair’s treacherous call for a second referendum.Yes, there would be turbulence as the UK adjusted to ending  years of EU membership.  But experts such as ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King predict we will look back on this moment and barely see a blip on our economic growth chart.Indeed, economists believe Britain will thrive and prosper once free from EU shackles. So why are Remainer MPs so implacably determined to stop it  Why are they reneging on their own manesto pledges and threatening to overturn the legislation which set the March deadline Simple. Once we are out, we are out for ever. We can prove we are a great world economy, trading to every corner of the globe — Europe included. We would never rejoin the cosy exclusive club beloved of the political elite, unelected bigwigs and business fat cats who ride the Brussels gravy train.Only  per cent of UK goods — one eighth — goes to Europe, with the rest heading for the wider world or home markets.The EU share of world trade is on the slide. Game-changing technology is alien to its socialist outlook. Where, for instance, is the EU equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon or Google Brussels turns its face against progress — allegedly because it threatens jobs. Yet Eurozone unemployment is double Britain’s and criminally high among young people.Remainers claim under-s are fans of the EU and would vote Remain in a second referendum. Labour is trying to cash in by cutting the voting age from  to . Yet a revealing new poll suggests the youth of Britain and Europe sees right through the EU drive for a political and economic superstate.Given the choice, they pick free markets, low tax and low regulation over the suffocatingly interventionist Grand Project. These tech-savvy youngsters can see Europe is trailing behind while unimaginable opportunities from robot technology and Articial Intelligence unfold.Britain would miss out too, barred by EU regulation,we tied ourselves indefinitely to this inward-looking protectionist bloc. A Full Brexit might cause a few short- term hiccups for just-in-time deliveries, but they will be quickly forgotten as decades of opportunity are opened up by Brexit.UKplc has nothing to fear but Project Fear itself. Warnings of economic chaos, mass unemployment and house price crashes have repeatedly proved to be .The same scare stories were peddled by the same people who  years ago predicted Britain would sink unless we joined the European single currency. We never looked back. It is the Eurozone that is now sinking, with Greece already under water. Britain’s jobs miracle is the envy of EuropeThe Eurozone is mired in a crisis inflicted by uncontrolled mass immigration and youth alienation.  The most patriotic Frenchman couldn’t claim Paris is nice at this time of the year. By contrast Britain is a hive of activity, with steady growth, booming exports and a jobs miracle which is the envy of Europe.The UK is a magnet to the EU’s unemployed and to foreign investment worth billions from tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google — despite Brexit.Leaving without a deal on March  is our best chance of implementing the  referendum and escaping from a teetering, corrupt and arrogant political fantasy before it implodes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His mouth was foaming. I have never in my le seen anything as bad as that. “I kind of paused for a second and then I just freaked out.“If we hadn’t got him out that day I don’t think he would have survived. “The situation, the abuse, was bad before - there’s no doubt - but that day when I opened the door up and saw him I was in complete shock. “He looked like he was close to death.“I picked Jordan up and gave him to my sister Allison so she could care for him and comfort him and I went outside and just called my mom and Brad out on it. “They both flipped out that I had opened the closet door - they said I had no business going in there, that it wasn’t anything to do with me.“At that point things escalated between me and Brad and we started shoving each other and I was just trying to draw as much attention as I could.“I knew at this point there was no turning back. “My mom had confiscated my phone but I had a prepaid phone so I called the police but in the meantime my mom was packing all the kids up and getting everyone out.”Tammi, , who was jailed for  years after being found guilty of injury to a child by omission, managed to escape to a hotel with Jordan and her younger children, while Brad fled the scene.Police arrested them both later that day and Jordan and his seven step-brothers and sisters were placed in emergency foster care. Jordan now lives with his biological mother where he has made a miracle recovery and is now a healthy, happy little boy.But Allison recalls how little Jordan was in such bad shape when he came out of the closet he could barely speak. “He didn’t even say anything - he was out of it, style consultant Allison said.He didn’t know what was going on. That’s what was so upsetting he didn’t even know what day it was. “I remember him falling and I picked him up and him just being in my arms was terrible.“It was like I wasn’t holding anything - he was so light - it wasn’t like holding a kid at all.“He was so, so white and his cheeks were sunken and he smelled terrible - it was just awful.“I hadn’t seen him for about a week before this and he was scared, he didn’t know what was happening.“I held him and I tried to comfort him and told him that I loved him and that everything will be okay.Cody, who is the eldest of seven kids, told how his stepfather Brad moved into their home when he was around  and brought Jordan shortly afterwards. He said the abuse started slowly - when he noticed how Brad would treat Jordan dferently to the other kids.“He was pretty aggressive with Jordan, Cody, a criminal justice student, recalled.It was like he was trying to make Jordan suffer. At first I just thought that’s kind of weird but then slowly after time, it started getting worse, “He would hit him around the back of the head, he’d take his belt off and hit him with it. He would throw him around and throw him on the ground.“I think abuse is one of those things that creeps up on you. At first it was hitting him on the back of the head and then it was the belt, then it was the denying food, and then putting him in the closet.“With the food it started with taking one dinner off him and then it turned into dinner and the lunch and then eventually it turned into not eating at all.” As the abuse got worse and worse, Cody even heard Brad use his Taser gun on the little boy - and saw the marks on his body. Tammi and Brad began to put Jordan in to “time outs” in the cupboard under the stairs. Cody recalled that one day he heard Jordan’s crying and went to investigate and discovered to his horror that the youngster was being kept in a little “cubbyhole” inside the cupboard.“There were clothes kind of covering up the closet door and when I opened it up I saw he wasn’t there - but I could hear his cries, he said.“That’s when I discovered he was actually in a little cubbyhole - like a closet within a closet. “It was pretty small I dont think he could have stood up all the way - he had to sit down or lie down.“It was a dark space and there was insulation coming through the sides.“It was under the staircase so you can see the indentions of the stairs.“There was nails going out of the ground, pieces of wood, it was a tile floor so pretty cold, wires coming out. “It was not somewhere that anyone should be.“Jordan would get put in there for no reason - I never saw him doing anything abnormal. He wasn’t a challenging kid, he was just a regular kid.”Allison recalls how Tammi and Brad even ended up putting a lock on the tiny cupboard after the starving little boy escaped one night and took some food from the kitchen.At first Jordan would be forced to eat his meals as fast as possible - before they were taken away completely and the little boy survived on the odd piece of bread his siblings managed to sneak to him.For the last six months of his le in the house, he was kept in the cupboard most of the time, with Allison saying it was like he would just disappear.Heartbreakingly, while Cody and Allison used to hear him sob and ask for help, towards the end, the abused boy didnt even have the energy to cry.“When they first started using food as a punishment they would allow him a dinner butit took him too long then they would take it away from him. So basically he was forced stuff it down, Allison said.“When they first started putting him in the cupboard they left it unlocked and he would sneak out when they were sleeping and go to the pantry to get food. “Now he was only three or four and he’s clumsy so stuff would fall and he’d make a mess.“My mom would get so mad and she would punish him by putting him back in the closet but they put a lock on it.“After a while I don’t think he was getting any food at all unless I managed to open the closet and hand him some bread on the rare times my mom and Brad were out.”As well as the physical abuse, Allison revealed how cruel Bradley would verbally terrorize his son too.“He would tell him to shut up a lot - just anything that he would say or do he’d go ‘Jordan, shut the f**k up - when he was just three or four years old, she said.“He would call him ‘stupid’ and a ‘crybaby - he said all sorts of things to just make him feel worthless.“It didnt matter, whatever he did, he just completely shut him down. “I remember there were several times where he was just singing in the car to himself and Brad would tell him to shut up, that he wasnt a good singer and that nobody wanted to hear that.“It was a lot for a little kid to take.“I would try to stick up for him whenever I could, I turned around and started rubbing his arm and telling him I loved him and that he could singhe wanted to, that he was a good singer and that I loved hearing him sing. That would make him happy. “I tried to do what I could but there was only so much I could do - I was a kid too.Both Allison and Cody challenged their parents several times about their treatment of Jordan.Brad would threaten or beat Cody and one of his other siblings, while Tammi would emotionally blackmail Allison and tell her thatshe told authorities about Jordan, all her siblings would be split up into dferent foster care and she’d never see them again. Despite the threats against them, Cody and Allison told friends, police officers and school counsellors about the abuse - but no one could help them. “The police had been to our house multiple times, Cody said. All the police officers told me there was nothing they could do about it. “The teachers were unsure what to do - nobody could help me at that point.“I remember police officers were actually at our front door and I asked them to come in and see what was happening and they said they couldn’t because I was underage and I didn’t own the house.“They were literally at our door and I was asking for help and they couldn’t do anything. “At that point I just felt kind of helpless - you know the cops are who you’re supposed to go to for help and they couldn’t do anything.“I wish that someone would have got involved sooner - before it became so bad.”Allison said she would listen to Jordan’s sobs at night and feel “completely hopeless” that no one could help. The brother and sister told how it was emotionally dficult to testy in court against their mother - but they knew it was “the right thing to do”.They said they were shocked when the judge Tammi handed a -year-sentence but they hope their mother will learn from her mistakes.And despite everything, they hope to one day have a relationship with Tammi, who they have not spoken to since . “Im really hoping that one day I can have a good relationship with my mom, Allison said.I just hope she can really realize some of her faults in all of this and one day we can all make amends.“No one wants to see their mom in this situation.And I thinkpeople can learn anything from our case - its to be more alert and involved when it comes to abuse.If you see something happening dont just turn the other way - speak up about it, evenits hard.No one should be afraid of speaking out about abuse. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s lovely to see.”The window display featuring the letter has now won first prize in the annual Canterbury’s Best Dressed Christmas Window competition.Whirligig’s founder, Peter Allinson, said there wasn’t a single person who had seen the letter who wasn’t moved by its simplicity.According to Findmypast, which carried out the research into Marjorie, the little girl became a solicitor, ed to her native Wigan and became a solicitor, dying in .Researcher Alex Cox said: “It’s a truly wonderful letter and there are literally millions of stories just like Marjorie’s that have been lost to history and are still waiting to be told.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0003969024871.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather worse 2019 heatwave storms arctic blasts","story":"We were battered by killer storms, had a snowy spring and then baked in scorching  degree heat.A report released by the Met Office on  November revealed that this year the average UK temperatures had increased by almost C from  - and weather throughout the seasons had become more extreme.ITV weather forecaster Alex Beresford tells Sun Online: This year was a fairly exceptional year, when you take into consideration everything that happened.With climate change it is certainly possible that we could see this happening again in the future, with stormier winters and hotter summers and that  will be another year of extremes.Here, Sun Online takes a look at the strangest weather of  - and examines what this could reveal about next years weather.This year: It seemed aswinter was going on forever in , with thick snow falling to the ground through to mid-March.Experts said this was the most signicant amount of snowfall in the UK since December  - and it was all thanks to the Beast from the East.The raging storm originated from Siberia, and brought night-time temperatures as low as -C in some parts - making it colder than the North Pole - and some places in East Anglia had up to four inches of snow.The biting cold battered the UK well into March, and shockingly a study from September found that there were , extra deaths in the country during this time.The research, undertaken by energy charities National Energy Action and Energy Action Scotland, said the freezing weather caused a surge in preventable deaths among frail and elderly people and left health and social care services “creaking at the seams”.Heart attacks, slips and falls and flu viruses were among the biggest killers - and it was thought thousands more were being discharged from hospital to homes with no electricity or heat after the Siberian storm caused power outages.Some of the deceased included a  year old man who died trying to save his dog from a freezing lake in South East London on  February, a  year old girl from Cornwall who was hit by a car that slid on ice into a bungalow on  March and a -year-old Scottish man who slipped and fell while crossing a bridge on the first weekend of March.Next years prediction: Independent forecaster Nick Finnis of WeatherEye tells Sun Online: Id say theres a reasonable chance mid January and into February,not before, of another Beast from the East accompanied by snow.This is due to warming high up in the atmosphere which leads to high pressure blocking - and north and cold arctic air is pushed towards us.He says this is also related to the start of the climate change, El Nino.El Nino is the change in climate over the Pacic Ocean and occurs every few years, when ocean temperatures in the Western Pacic become unusually high, affecting weather around the world, amplying storm tracks.This year: As England stormed through to the quarter finals in the World Cup, a jubilant UK public camped out in beer gardens and parks across the UK baking in a spell of unprecedented hot weather.There may have been no Glastonbury this year, but the dry summer meant those heading to music festivals around the UK could leave their wellies at home.According to the UK Met Office, this was the UK’s warmest summer since , the driest since  and the sunniest since .The hottest day of the year according to the Met office was  July, with the highest temperature of a scorching . degrees recorded in Felsham, Suffolk.Deaths rose  above average during this time due to the heatwave, and June was in the top five hottest months on record.The scorching weather wasn’t confined to the traditional summer months either.Summer arrived early for the week of  to  April, which saw temperatures exceeding  degrees across most of central and eastern England, making it hotter than Spain.Next years prediction: Alex Beresford says: More and more people are waking up to the fact that climate change is real and is having an effect.Stormier winters lead to hotter summers - wed all love the postcard-perfect hot summer and snowy winter, but the reality of global warming is that itll be extremely hot summers then stormy, wet, miserable winters.There is every possibility that summer  will see hotter temperatures than what we would usually expect in the UK.The Met Office said man-made climate change made this years scorching temperatures  times more likely than under natural conditions.There have also been warnings that the UK could be hit with a drought as early as in spring next year,  unless reservoirs are filled from higher-than-average rainfall through the winter months.This could also see a hose pipe ban being put into place.This year: Our storms were so bad that we had to adopt the US system of naming them.With names such as Emma, Diana and Hector, they immediately started trending on Twitter and Google.Alex tells Sun Online the Met Office decided to name storms to make the general public more aware of weather warnings.Rounding off the winter, Storm Emma caused death and destruction when it hit the UK in March .Travel was severely disrupted and Glasgow airport closed due to weather conditions on  February.As much as  cm of snow fell in Scotland and a man was killed after falling into a frozen lake in a London park.Storm Hector brought strong winds up to  mph to Northern Ireland before heading to Scotland and the North of England in June, just in time for the summer holidays.Storm Ali hit the UK in September, bringing with it wind speeds of up to  mph across Northern Ireland, Scotland, northern England and parts of north Wales.Two people were killed as a result of the storm - one in Co Galway after her caravan blew off a clf while she slept in it.Storm Diana had forecasters warning of potential loss of le due to high winds, rain and falling debris. Hitting the UK in the last days of November, Diana arrived just in time for annual Christmas lights being switched on around the country.She brought torrential rain and hazardous driving conditions for all who stood in her path, and one woman was killed by a falling tree in Wiltshire.Next years prediction: Alex says: I cant see that this pattern of storms will change in .Again, they are usually caused by climate change and as we head into next year we will probably see more extremes.These storms will once again cause a lot of damage to buildings and endanger lives. With storms come risks and they are dangerous - the weather warning systems are there for a reason.As weather forecasters, we try and push these weather warnings out as much as we can, aspeople can prepare for stormy weather they have a better chance of surviving.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I ended up having a panic attack in the middle of the Jobcentre from the shock.Universal Credit replaces six benefits with a single monthly payment. One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to % of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.After taking into account her husbands wages from his job at a cinema, the family has just £ a month to live on compared to £, before moving onto Universal Credit.She said: Our money has dropped dramatically. We are short every month, just for our bills.“We have maxed out the credit card, we are living off beans on toast, the heating is only on for one hour a day.“It’s awful for our daughter, she is back having school dinners, which she hates and sometimes doesn’t eat but I can’t afford to make a packed lunch.We are borrowing money off family saying we will pay it back one day.Mrs Thompson also said the family doesnt feel Christmas will be as special this year.She said: We can’t afford new decorations for the tree, any treats or any of the things that make Christmas special.“We have to turn the lights off the tree because it wastes more electricity.Diane Davies, from Margate, said her disabled -year-old mum, who has asked not to be named, is unable to afford food or heat her home.She explained: “My mum has been signed off sick by the doctor for three years because one of her discs slipped.“There are some days she cannot walk, other days she is better. But Universal Credit says she’s fit to work.“They have spent hundreds of pounds sending her on computer courses to prepare her for a new job – but she’s got arthritis in her hands which means some days only two of her fingers work.IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Her credit was stopped a month ago because she has been unable to fill in her daily journal.Now, Ms Davies said she has been forced to buy her mum basic groceries as she has been let down by the system.She said: “It breaks my heart sometimes.“Everyone should have access to basic rights such as eating and heating their houses and its awful people can not afford that.Mum-of-two, Marie Griggs, from Folkestone, Kent, said that after bills and rent shes left with about £ a week to live on.The -year-old, who says PTSD, social anxiety and bipolar disorder have left her unable to work, said there are no other options.She said: I get £, a month. I couldn’t believe it when they said I have to pay my rent out of that. I dont know how people live on it.I’ve been told I can go to a food bank but how embarrassing is that Universal Credit replaces the following benefits:Whether you can claim Universal Credit depends on where you live and your circumstances.Currently, Universal Credit is mainly claimed by the unemployed, or those on a low income.If youre already on benefits, you dont need to apply for Universal Credit unless your circumstances change or youre told to by the DWP.Ms Griggs, who has two children age  and , added: “I cannot take my kids on days out any more, even just to the places we used to go before.“Christmas is going to be tight. They are not getting as much as they did last year.“All my family will going out on Boxing Day but we won’t be able to go.“I just think its unfair and people are struggling.

in this case a beagle.It took several tries before the embryo took.Juices copy, Little Juice -- or Zhizhi in Chinese -- was born in mid-September and stayed with its surrogate mother in Sinogenes lab for about a month.The puppy was later given to He at a small ceremony at which the original Juice was present.While He has not committed Little Juice to show business just yet, he sees lots of potential.He said: We believe hell be even better than the older Juice.”Little Juice looked more like his older self every day, He said."},{"url":null,"title":"moment footie fan calls vulnerable derby county rival inbred in sick taunts","story":"Taunting the young supporter, the Forest fan makes him say he is a “sheeps****er” and jokes about Derby fans being “inbred”.Nottingham Forest FC said they are investigating the footage which has been viewed more than , times online.Police today said they were treating the incident as a hate crime and have appealed for information.It comes ahead of the two sides meeting tonight in the first East Midlands derby of the season.The video appears to have been filmed in a shopping centre in Nottingham.Speaking to the camera the Forest supporter says: “Here he is, look, what are you doing with that on mate ” as he points to his Derby shirt.He then says: “You shouldn’t be wearing that in this city, that top.”Mocking his vulnerable rival he says: “You see, they say all f****** Derby fans are inbred but you prove it is not true.”The victim continues to stare at the man and replies “yeah.”The Forest supporter says: “You take it easy yeah, but remember youre a sheep sh****r yeah, remember that yeah, say it, Im a sheep sh****r.”The Derby County fan then replies: “Im a sheepsh****r.”Many Forest supporters have taken to social media to express their disgust at the disturbing video.It’s not clear when the video was filmed but it’s come to light ahead of tonight’s grudge game.A spokesman for Nottingham Forest FC said: “There is a serious risk that the material discloses the commission of a criminal offence and we have therefore referred the matter to the police.A Nottinghamshire Police spokesperson said: “Were aware of a video circulating on social media and were working together with Nottingham Forest Football Club to investigate the incident.“We are treating the incident as a hate crime.

with some arguing he should have pushed for a binding vote of no confidence in the Government as a whole, instead of a symbolic one on the PM personally.Tory MP Michael Fabricant quipped: It is revealing to note that Labour chickens out from a vote of no confidence in the Government.The SNPs Stewart McDonald added: He can’t even do a pre-arranged stunt properly, so you’ll forgive me for not believing that Jeremy Corbyn has some grand master plan on Brexit that saves us from this mess.LABOURS gambit today is designed to humiliate Theresa May and increase the pressure on her to resign.But it falls short of a formal vote of no confidence in the Government overall which would trigger a General Election.Jeremy Corbyn has faced repeated demands from his own MPs and other parties to table a proper no-confidence motion.That would be legally binding with a General Election taking placethe Government lost.But a vote on Mrs May personally, as opposed to the Government, would be only symbolic.Mr Corbyn is understood to believe he would lose any attempt at a full no-confidence vote, because the DUP and rebel Tories would stand behind the Government.Instead he hopes to peel off enough Brexiteers who want to see the PM gone but dont want an election.Some MPs insisted Mrs May would be under huge moral pressure to resignshe lost the confidence vote.But others - including Labours Owen Smith - claim the gesture is pointless because it would have no legal effect.Its not even certain that the motion will ever be debated in Parliament because Commons bosses have no obligation to schedule time for it before Christmas.During her Commons statement this afternoon, Mrs May boasted of standing up to Eurocrat bully Jean-Claude Juncker after he called her plans nebulous and imprecise at the European Council.She said: Some of the resulting exchanges at this Council were robust. But I make no apology for standing up for the interests of this House and the interests of our whole United Kingdom.The PM vowed to secure changes to the hated Irish backstop proposals which have doomed her deal so far.Mrs May said: I know this House is still deeply uncomfortable about the backstop.

The debate on Theresa Mays Brexit deal willto Parliament in the week commencing January  and the meaningful vote will take place the following week, the Prime Minister told MPs today. It means the vote will finally take place at least five weeks after it was originally scheduled, on December . The Prime Minister admitted this situation was not “perfect.” But she added: “If we let the perfect be the enemy of the good, we risk not leaving the EU at all.”  Mrs May said: It is now only just over  weeks until the UK leaves the EU and I know many members of this House are concerned that we need to take a decision soon. My right honourable friend the Leader of the House will set out business on Thursday in the usual way, but I can confirm today that we intend toto the meaningful vote debate in the week commencing January  and hold the vote the following week. And there was uproarious laughter from MPs and rolled eyes from the Labour front benches as Mrs May suggested Brexit should not be about party interests. She said: Let us not follow the Leader of the Opposition in thinking about what gives him the best chance of forcing a general election. Because at this critical moment in our history, we should be thinking not about our party’s interests, but about the national interests.” Heres Theresa Mays statement in full Mr Speaker, with permission, I would like to make a Statement on last week’s European Council. Before turning to Brexit, let me touch on two signicant conclusions from the other business of the Council. First, we expressed our utmost concern over the escalation we have seen at the Kerch Straits and the Sea of Azov and Russia’s continued violations of international law. We agreed to roll-over economic sanctions against Russia and we stand ready to further strengthen our support, in particular, for the affected areas of Ukraine. And second, we also agreed to work together on tackling the spread of deliberate, large-scale and systematic disinformation, including as part of hybrid warfare. On this I outlined some of the world-leading work that the UK is doing in this field. And I was clear that after we have left the European Union, the UK will continue to work closely with our European partners to uphold the international rules based system and to keep all our people safe. And that is why it is right that our Brexit deal includes the deepest security partnership that has ever been agreed with the EU. Mr Speaker, at this Council I faithfully and firmly reflected the concerns of this House over the Northern Ireland backstop. I explained the assurances we had already agreed with the EU were insufficient for this House - and that we had to go further in showing that we never want to use this backstop and,it is used, it must be a temporary arrangement. Some of the resulting exchanges at this Council were robust. But I make no apology for standing up for the interests of this House and the interests of our whole United Kingdom.In response, the EU  published a series of conclusions. They made clear that it is their – and I quote – “firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes by st December  alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be triggered.” The House will forgive me, but I think this bears repeating: “the backstop will not need to be triggered.” They underlined that “ the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered, it would apply temporarily.” They said that in this event the EU “would use its best endeavours to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the backstop.” And they gave a new assurance in relation to the Future Partnership with the UK, to make it even less likely that the backstop would ever be needed by stating that the EU “stands ready to embark on preparations immediately after signature of the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure that negotiations can start as soon as possible after the UK’s withdrawal.”Mr Speaker, in these conclusions, in their statements at the Council and in their private meetings with me, my fellow EU leaders could not have been clearer – they do not want to use this backstop. They want to agree the best possible future relationship with us. There is no plot to keep us in the backstop. Indeed, President Macron said on Friday - “we can clary and reassure…the backstop is not our objective, it is not a durable solution and nobody is trying to lock the UK into the backstop.” As formal conclusions from a European Council, these commitments have legal status and should be welcomed. They go further than the EU has ever done previously in trying to address the concerns of this House. And of course they sit on top of the commitments that we have already negotiated in relation to the backstop: including… …ensuring the customs element is UK-wide …that both sides are legally committed to using best endeavours to have our new relationship in place before the end of the Implementation Period …thatthe new relationship isn’t ready we can choose to extend the Implementation Period instead of the backstop coming into force …thatthe backstop does come in, we can use alternative arrangements, not just the future relationship, to get out of it …that the treaty is clear the backstop can only ever be temporary …and that there is an explicit termination clause. But Mr Speaker, I know this House is still deeply uncomfortable about the backstop. And I understand that. And I want us to go further still in the reassurances we secure. Discussions with my EU partners - including Presidents Tusk, Juncker and others - have shown that further clarication following the Council’s conclusions is in fact possible. So discussions are continuing to explore further political and legal assurances. We are also looking closely at new ways of empowering the House of Commons to ensure that any provision for a backstop has democratic legitimacy and to enable the House to place its own obligations on the government to ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely. But it is now only just over  weeks until the UK leaves the EU. And I know many Members of this House are concerned that we need to take a decision soon. My Rt Hon Friend, the Leader of the House, will set out business on Thursday in the usual way. But I can confirm today that we intend toto the Meaningful Vote debate in the week commencing th January and hold the vote the following week. Mr Speaker, when we have the vote, Members will need to reflect carefully on what is in the best interests of our country. I know that there are a range of very strongly held personal views on this issue across the House. And I respect all of them. But expressing our personal views is not what we are here to do.We asked the British people to take this decision.  current Members of this House voted for the Referendum in June , with just  voting against. And the British people responded by instructing us to leave the European Union. Similarly  current Members of this House voted to trigger Article , to set the process of our departure in motion, with only  of today’s Members voting against. Now we must honour our duty to finish the job. I know this is not everyone’s perfect deal. It is a compromise. Butwe let the perfect be the enemy of the good then we risk leaving the EU with no deal. Of course we have prepared for no deal, and tomorrow the Cabinet will be discussing the next phase in ensuring we are ready for that scenario. But let us not risk the jobs, services and security of the people we serve by turning our backs on an agreement with our neighbours that honours the referendum and provides for a smooth and orderly exit. Avoiding no deal is only possiblewe can reach an agreement orwe abandon Brexit entirely. And as I said in the debate earlier this month – “do not imagine thatwe vote this down, a dferent deal is going to miraculously appear.” If you want proof, look at the Conclusions of this Council. As President Juncker said: “it is the best deal possible and the only deal possible” And any proposal for the future relationship - whether Norway, Canada, or any other iety that has been mentioned - would require agreeing this Withdrawal Agreement. The Leader of the Opposition - as well as some others - are trying to pretend they could do otherwise. This is a fiction. Finally let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum. Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver. Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it. And let us not follow the Leader of the Opposition in thinking about what gives him the best chance of forcing a General Election. For at this critical moment in our history, we should be thinking not about our party’s interests, but about the national interest. Let us a find a way to come together and work together in the national interest to see this Brexit through. Mr Speaker, I will work tirelessly over these new few weeks to fulfil my responsibility as Prime Minister to find a way forwards. Over the last two weeks, I have met quite a number of colleagues and I am happy to continue to do so on this important issue so that we can fulfil our responsibilities to the British people. So together, we can take back control of our borders, laws and money while protecting the jobs, the security and the integrity of our precious United Kingdom. So together we can move on to finalising the future relationship with the European Union and the trade deals with the rest of the world that can fuel our prosperity for years to come. And so together we can get this Brexit done and sht the national focus to our domestic priorities - investing in our NHS, our schools and housing tackling the injustices that so many still face and building a country that truly works for everyone. For these are the ways in which, together, this House will best serve the interests of the British people. And I commend this Statement to the House.

So whats actually in todays plans  Weve taken a lookShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsTheresa May has unveiled new rights for workers - but unions say it leaves zero-hour workers with no more leverage than Oliver Twist \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory ministers today unveiled what they claim is the most radical overhaul of workers rights for a generation. Agency and part-time staff will get new rights in a bid to close loopholes that have left them exploited. Ministers claim the package of measures will boost earning potential across the UK. But unions warn its a reluctant baby step that will leave almost a million zero-hour workers with no more leverage than Oliver Twist. So whats the detail of what has been announced today, how will it affect you, and why are people het up about it  Here is a brief guide.  The government commissioned a review into the modern world of work by advisor Matthew Taylor, chief of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. He made  recommendations, many of them very technical but promising a crackdown on the so-called gig economy. The Government said it was taking forward  of the recommendations from the Taylor report. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: Todays largest upgrade in workers rights in over a generation is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK. What is the government actually doing   Among the main plans announced by the Business Department are:The formula to work out your holiday pay will be made fairer. Currentlyyou work iable hours - like in a shop in the Christmas sales - your holiday allowance is based on your hours in the previous  weeks. Thatll be expanded to an average over  weeks and therell be a new campaign to make workers aware. ButZero-hour contract workers will get the right to request a more predictable and stable set of hours - though this doesnt mean it will be guaranteed. And zero-hour contracts will not be wiped out. Youll be considered a continuous worker - with more rights - evenyour service is broken by up to four weeks. Currently its just one week. A loophole that lets firms hire agency workers on lower wages than staff is being closed. The Swedish derogation will be repealed in the UK - stopping firms holding workers on long-term contracts but with periods of little to no work. Workers will get a written statement of their rights on day one. Currently its only available to full employeesafter two months. This includes sick leave and maternity or paternity leave. Firms that have shown malice, spite or gross oversight in an employment tribunal can be fined pound, - quadruple the current rate. And those that dont pay tribunal awards on time will be named and shamed. Itll be easier for you to demand an information and consultation regime from bosses. Right now % of the workforce have to request it - now itll be %. The minimum will still be  employees though. Firms that dont give holiday pay properly will face a crackdown. A new enforcement body will target firms not doing their bit in the same way as firms are targeted for not paying minimum wage.Why do critics say its not enough    Essentially left-wing critics say the measures are welcome but the government needs to go further. TUC general secretary Frances OGrady said: Scrapping the agency worker loophole is a victory for union campaigning. It was an undercutters charter. But these reforms as a whole wont sht the balance of power in the gig economy. Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour. The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right all. Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist. Rebecca Long Bailey, shadow business secretary, said: This Conservative Government has failed to support workers. Instead it has increased tribunal fees, attacked the health and safety of workers, introduced the draconian Trade Union Act and presided over the lowest wage growth in a decade.   These proposals do nothing to tackle the growing number of people on precarious zero hours contracts and with their botched Brexit deal threatening jobs and rights theyll have to do a lot more than this to reassure workers. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: These measures may help make working le a little more bearable for some. But put simply the Government could and should have gone much further. Little will change to help the most exploited workers, and the most unscrupulous bosses are unlikely to start quaking in their boots. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said: The Governments plans are reluctant baby steps at best, and hardly give confidence that post-Brexit UK will be a country of decent jobs. This is a time of historic low wages and of chronic job insecurity. We need proper, substantial action to combat this but what is on offer today falls well short of what this country needs to deliver work that pays. People on zero-hour contracts and workers in the insecure economy need much more than a weak right to request a contract and more predictable hours.

Daredevil Tom Butler, , took on a huge swell at The Nazareacute in Portugal estimated to be more than ft tall . He says onlookers and surfing experts were confident he had beaten the previous record of ft, which was set earlier this year by Brazilian Rodrigo Koxa. Tom, of Newquay, Cornwall, said surfing the wave was like running away from a raging bull. He must now submit photographic evidence to the World Surf League which will officiate the claim ahead of an awards ceremony in April. Tom said: Its the biggest wave surfed in the world this season and could beat the current big wave world record.  When I was going down I thought, holy f**k, this is the fastest Ive ever been. Time kind of slows down, its instinct really. I was doing everything to hold my balance. Thats when youre training comes in - I do lots of gymnastics training to help me keep balanced. Its hard to say exactly how big it was, Id say it was  times my height and Im ft. You dont really see it behind you because youre so concentrated on whats ahead of you. Its like running from a raging bull you dont stop to think about how much it weighs -you get eye contact then youve already failed. I reckon it was maybe  or even ft. I havent had a ruler handy while in Portugal but when I get home Ill try to figure it out. It was a monster, I know that for sure. But many photo journalists who cover the sport here on a regular basis believe my wave surfed on Fridaycould be taller than the previous world record wave.Tom is no stranger to big wave surfing - in  he made headlines around the world after a dramatic crash at The Nazareacute. He was left with a lung injury and bleeding from the ear but lived to surf another day and is now back in the same spot in search of monster waves.  His potential record-breaker was filmed on Friday when he said the conditions were just right. He added: I was under the whole peak of the wave. It was definitely one of the most committed lines and biggest waves Ive ridden. I was completely underneath and there was more risk, theres a lot more power and a higher mass of water. Tom is a professional surfer and grew up surfing the waves at Fistral Beach near his home in Newquay. Since then hes gone on to become one of the worlds best surfers and is sponsored by GoPro, NineFeetTall and Sudeste Sports. He spends his le surfing the best spots in the world and is a frequent visitor to the Nazareacute, near Praia do Norte in Portugal snd known for producing massive waves. He added: I fell off here two years ago during a big wave event and the waves were nowhere near as big as this one. Its nice to be back here. I didnt really have any doubts. Its more terrying afterwards when youre watching the wave back because, at the time, you are so focused in the moment. Ive been coming here each winter for six years with my teammate Sebastian Steudtner and now were one of the longest standing teams. On Friday Sebastian had about five goes then I had my turn and thats when the big one came.   With the hard part done, Tom will now submit his evidence to the World Surf League ahead of the Big Wave Awards in April. He added: The World Surf League are the people that give the official confirmation, they work with Guinness. No one knows how they measure it, its a closed . The decision will be made in April but its exciting. Ive made the last five for Barrel of the Year but I didnt win it. They dont rank it, they just give a winner out. It will either be the biggest wave or not. Theres more time to go yet, the Atlantic will keep producing big waves in January and February. But its a real team effort, I had Sebastian and a lady called Maya Gabeira, she holds the womens record for the biggest wave surfed.

Harry pipes up: But what about Uncle Andrew  He had to stop being an official ambassador for British business because he kept being photographed with that American who was a convicted paedophile. Meghan snfs and wipes her eyes. Are you guys serious  SurelyI go to Sandringham for tea, Her Royal Majestyness will have me hung, drawn and quartered because of my terrible, bad-mannered antecedents  The three more experienced Royals share a look of amusement. No, says Kate. Her oldest son was caught on tape making sexy talk about being a tampon. Shes chilled. And William adds: Its the servants wholl beat you with an etiquette manual thrice before dawn and twice more at lunch.  It would suit many people to believe that Meghans troublesome dad is at the root of a deep sense of unease in the Royal Family about its newest member. It would suit racists, people who pretend theyre not racists, and one Mr Thomas Markle Esquire, the biggest plonker of any parish he chooses to enter. This morning he told viewers of GMB that he had been shunned by his daughter because of Royal protocol. Theyre reading all of the things in the tabloids and what people are saying Im saying and Ive only done  interviews and out of those interviews hundreds of other people come and say Ive said these things and I havent said these things but theyre believing it and Im being shunned, he said, in much the same tone as a -year-old complaining the mess he was discovered up to his knees in was someone s fault. It may be worth pointing out, here, that Thomas first interview was with GMB in June. His second and third were with the Mail on Sunday in July and August, the fourth was with the Daily Mail a week ago, and on each occasion he said it was the last interview. And they followed a series of staged paparazzi snaps and chats with TMZ. If he really was a -year-old, the nearest responsible adult would at this stage give him a stern talking-to about dishonesty. As hes a grandfather aged , he is instead spending an extended period on the naughty step. And from this perch a man of senior years but juvenile intellect is doing everything he can to make his situation worse, while claiming it must be the Queens fault. Or British stuffiness. Or, or, or, the cat.  Even the briefest glance at Royal history proves they have more than one relative who causes headaches with wedding planning, tabloid newspapers or bank managers. Fergies always going broke, Princess Michael is best ignored and the new Prince Louis is probably destined for the louche le of a playboy. The Royals dont care about any of that. The newspapers do, because its wonderful stuff, and readers do because it all adds to the gaiety of the nation, especially at Christmas when so many of us are reminded of family members who share our DNA but little . What the Royals want is a quiet le. Public controversy rocks the ship of state, as well as making them look stupid, so the first Royal urge with such relatives is to not be seen with them, while ensuring privately that troubled waters are soothed. Thats why Uncle Gary is still on speakers with the Middletons, and by extension the Royals. Its why Edward and Andrew kept their heads down for a bit after each scandal, and why Fergies debts and living arrangements have been regularised. In the House of Windsor, quiet continuity is the order of the day.  Its people who cannot stand this absorption of change who stoke the controversies - people who think a monarchy must be rigid to survive, and dont notice that it needs to be flexible. So its the staff who raise their eyebrows. The courtiers who say this isnt done, the constitutional experts who claim that the wearing of black nail nish is punishable with death and that, somewhere, there is a piece of vellum stating with authority that LADIES. WEAR. HATS. The people who live it, on the other hand, learn to roll. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\" The Queen knows it is the soap opera her family has become that causes them the most problems, the deepest harm, and makes them more beloved. That her in-laws and offspring are a cipher for how we all feel about our own. Unwelcome as it may be, it roots the Royals more firmly in the lives of their people.

Mary Turner Thomson, , from Edinburgh, thought she had the perfect marriage until she found out that her American husband William Allen Jordan was a serial bigamist.

She said: “I thoughtwe didn’t give them money, they would kill the kids. I was living in abject error.”   The American’s lies fell apart when the other Mrs Jordan rang Mary in April .He was jailed for bigamy, illegally possessing a stun gun, fraud, and other offences.

He smiles tiredly when I sit down, but insists he doesn’t mind the frivolity, it’s just he himself is inhabiting a parallel universe, a world on pause. “I don’t resent the celebration for Christmas,” he says, patiently, his face very pale. “It just feels like another space, that isn’t the space I’m in. I’m not ready to celebrate yet. It’s not my time.” It will only be his time when his we Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe is released from the Iranian prison where she has been held since April , after being arrested at Tehran airport ing from an innocent visit to her parents, on charges of conspiring to overthrow the regime. And when she and their daughter, Gabriella, four, who was with her and who has been living with her grandparents in Tehran ever since, are finally back home with him in their north London flat.   Refused a visa to visit, his only relationship with Gabriella since then has been via skype, and with Nazanin by phone – and this will, devastatingly, be his third Christmas without them. Yet he will buy them both presents, as he has done for the last two years, sending Gabriella’s to his in-laws, while faithfully keeping Nazanin’s, hopefully wrapped, for when she s. “There is a wintery furry hat that I bought the first year last year a handbag – that is what she wanted,” he says. “This year she is not ready to say what she wants, she just wants to come home. But I will buy her a present and wrap it. “All the presents I buy Nazanin are for her le here, there is a future, positive side to it. “They are wrapped up waiting for her. But I’m not sureemotionally I can put the presents under the tree. It feels to me too sad.”  Three weeks ago, the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt visited Iran for the first time, to demand Nazanin, sentenced to five years in prison, be released. There is little more supposed evidence for their charges against her, than her previous admin job in London with BBC Media Action, and her current one with the Thomas Reuters Foundation. Some Iranian officials have confirmed she is a pawn in a political row with the British Government she has been told told her imprisonment rests on a haggle over a poundmillion debt from a s arms deal, owed by Britain. Richard and Nazanin initially dared to hope it would get resolved in time for Christmas, especially as earlier this year Nazanin was finally granted three long overdue days furlough with her family. But now that hope is disintegrating as Brexit and an imploding British government distract from their plight. Tonight, Richard plans a carol service and vigil outside Downing Street to keep up the pressure. And together, they can only cling to the memory of their last Christmas a family, pictured here, and hope to repeat it. It was their first in their then new flat the first Gabriella, then almost  months, started to grasp the magic. “If Nazanin suddenly came home I have promised her we would do all the things we did the last year,” Richard says. “The things she looks forward to doing is what we did for our last Christmas together. “We would do the mad dash around on Christmas Eve, find a Christmas tree. Then, Gabriella was tiny in the pram. We went and bought the tree down the road, carried it up and decorated it together, felt that nice happy feeling. “Sitting having a cup of tea in the living room with the family playing around – that is what in Nazanin’s mind’s eye Christmas is.” But now more than ever, a warm tea in her own living room this Christmas has become too painful for Nazanin to even hope for. That nice happy feeling is one neither she nor Richard recognises.  She is at one of the lowest ebbs he has ever known her since her imprisonment. That is in part because this Christmas also includes her th birthday, on Boxing Day, which has come to symbolise the most painful of deadlines. Nazanin is desperate for another baby and fears time is running out. “She is very low and despairing, almost wanting to stop hoping because the hope is too much,” says Richard. “For her the key point is turning  on Boxing Day,we cross that point and she’s still in prison there will be a fundamental hurt and decision to do something. That something she is threatening is a hunger strike. She has done it before, two years ago while she was held in solitary confinement at the beginning of her prison term. She continued her strike for a week until her mother’s terried collapse, and Gabriella’s resulting anguish, stopped her. But now Richard does not believe he can stop her – and doesn’t feel he has the right. “I would hope she didn’t go to the bitter end,” he says, carefully. “I have to talk her down,” he explains of their increasingly emotional phone calls. “I feel it’s not my right to say ‘You can never do it’. There’s very little she has control over. It’s not for me to take away the only card she has to play.” Nazanin’s desperation is also being heightened by fear for her health. She has found lumps in her breasts, and is not being allowed a specialist check-up. Although she has found them before and they were diagnosed as benign, she fears the worst. “If it doesn’t happen,she does not come out for Christmas, we will have a fall out from Nazanin to react to,” says Richard, solemnly. “And then we will have to pick a fight.”   Fighting, campaigning, is what Richard has done tirelessly since going public with his we’s imprisonment. How he persists, how he continues to talk Nazanin back from an edge of despair, is unimaginable. And all the time trying to forge a relationship with his daughter on an iPhone screen who now doesn’t speak English. “Gabriella asked her mum about six months ago ‘Do you know Daddy  Have you ever met Daddy ’ “Of course for her I’m just a face on the phone,” he shrugs, pained. “Nazanin was mortied, horried.” But he continues. What  can he do  He will send Gabriella the red dress and shoes she has asked for this Christmas, and he will talk to his in-laws about making her a stocking – a stocking he would love to fill. And he will talk to her on Christmas Day, and see the dress and shoes – and hope the prison allows Nazanin to call him, too. There is still a small part of him that dares to hope for this year, but it is diminishing. And he has firmly given Gabriella no hint of hope at all. Yet she still clearly does, while not quite understanding what it all means in the surreal world which has become her reality. “She asks her mum ‘Are we going to go back to London for Father Christmas ’” Richard smiles, not minding at all that he’s been usurped. Please join the Free Nazanin campaign for Christmas carols Tuesday  from .pm opposite Downing Street to stand in solidarity for her release, and the release of all British citizens currently in detention."},{"url":null,"title":"teenager stunned find shes nine","story":"NewsTeenager stunned to find shes nine months pregnant - despite washboard stomachSize  Saffron Heffer, , from Essex was shocked when doctors re-positioned the baby and produced a sudden giant bumpShareCommentsByJessica Cripps:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video six-things-you-shouldnt-ignore-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenager with a flat stomach was shocked when doctors told her she was nine months pregnant. Saffron Heffer, , claims she had no idea she was expecting a baby and it was only when they re-positioned the baby that it created a sudden giant bump. The teen from Essex said her mum suggested she took a pregnancy test when they spotted a strange line on her tummy. And it turned out that she was  weeks pregnant - giving birth to her son Oscar Heffer just six weeks later. Aside from the mark, which turned out to be a pigmentation line, Saffron showed no physical signs of pregnancy and had been visiting the gym and going on sunbeds completely unaware. The retail assistant put her missed periods down to the pill and her cravings for ice cream, lettuce and strawberries due to them being on offer at the shop. Have you had a similar experience  Email webnews@mirror  An emergency midwe appointment confirmed her baby boy was back-to-back in her womb - and after her midwe twisted him around Saffrons stomach popped into a giant bump. Saffron said: It was a surprise for everyone. My mum was just as shocked as I am. I personally didnt believe it was possible [to not know you were pregnant] until it happened to me. People said it and I heard the stories and I thought they must have known. But until it happened to me I was completely oblivious. Incredible pictures show Saffron just days before she discovered she was pregnant with a perfectly-toned tummy and then a giant bump after the baby was re-positioned days later. After just six weeks preparing for the new arrival, baby Oscar was born a healthy lb oz on June   - and despite the shock Saffron loves being a mum to her little boy. She said: While I was pregnant and didnt know, I was going down to the gym and I was still having sunbeds. I was down the gym the day I found out and doing sit ups with my mum. We were laughing that my belly goes in a funny triangle shape. It just didnt click - even my mum said she didnt think for a moment that I could be pregnant. It was my mum who realised I had a pigmentation line on my stomach. My mum [Melissa Heffer, ] noticed it and told me she wanted me to do a test just to rule it out.  I saidI was [pregnant] then Id literally have to be ready to pop, and I had no stomach, nothing, nothing whatsoever. So I said okay then. I did the test - and obviously it didnt rule it out at all. It told me that I was pregnant. In the end I did get a bump. It was huge. Saffron continued: I saw the midwe, she turned him around and then I just gained a balloon. It went huge. I was still in my size  jeans, but it was massive, I have to admit. It wasnt straight away huge but I could see a small bump. It was an early pregnancy bump [at first] where you cant tell and then [after I saw a midwe] every day it grew hourly. When she turned him around he became very active. I could feel every movement and every kick. It was so strange. From feeling nothing at all to feeling everything daily is just unreal. I do miss the feeling though, I have to say. I was absolutely shocked. I thought my le had ended. Im  now, and I was only  when I found out and thats a lot to take in for an adult, let alone a  year old. I was just hit with depression and thought what am I going to do  I was very stressed when I found out. Both my parents were at work so it was just me dealing with it emotionally and physically on my own. I locked myself away for at least two weeks of it. It was the shock - I didnt know how to respond. After that two weeks I had the get-go mindset that it is what it is. You cant change anything. I was just like - right, okay, I can do this. Ive been strong with other things before. This is a bit bigger, but I can do this. I just got on with it really. I just got on with it and a few weeks later he was born. I wouldnt turn back now - hes beautul.  Hes perfect. If you had to ask for a perfect baby it would be him. Hes so content, he just sits and sleeps and cuddles. Hes so lovely. Saffron had felt lethargic for months - with doctors telling her she was anaemic and vitamin D and B deficient. She became frustrated by the lack of change in her symptoms and refused to take the medication she was given. But instead of gaining weight, the teenager claims she lost weight - dropping from a size  to a size . Saffron said: At one point I thought I was dying because I didnt know what was wrong with me. I was so lethargic and sleepy, I didnt want to go out, I didnt want to see anybody. I didnt want to spend time with anyone ever because the littlest things annoyed me and got on my nerves and I didnt know what to do. I lost weight. I didnt gain any at all. I was in size  jeans before and I found out I was pregnant and was in a size , and Im back in a size  jean now. Ive had no explanation at all [as to why I didnt get a bump]. They thought that possibly when he was born he was born with chicken legs. They thought that possibly one of the reasons I didnt have a belly was his chicken legs. We were back to back anyway, I knew that, and he was possibly breech. Saffron continued: Up until I saw my midwe the first time - I think she turned him around actually. I found out on the Sunday, on the Monday I went to the doctors and they booked me an emergency appointment with the midwe. She dug her hands in and said I can feel a baby but I cant tell you size-wise. She dug her hands in and twisted him round. I felt her moving [him] and I felt his first ever kick. I was a size  throughout the whole pregnancy. Even the day I gave birth I was in my size - jeans. They gave me the pill and said you might not get periods and thats normal. So I took my pill and I wasnt getting periods and I thought, cor, thats lucky. I was swearing blind about it and saying it was the best thing. I was taking it so I wouldnt get my periods and then, boom, had a baby. I had cravings but didnt know they were cravings. I was craving Cornettos, lettuce leaves and strawberries. I went out and didnt realise it was a craving - I just thought I was buying them because they were on a good deal. Im loving being a mum. Its so rewarding. The main thing I love is just seeing him happy. When he smiles and laughs thats when you know youre doing a good job.

The group implored shoppers in Brightons Waitrose to shun animal products - holding up plates covered in blood and placards saying: “Humane murder is a lie. The Direct Action Everywhere group walked into the store with placards saying ‘It’s not food, it’s violence’ and ‘Their bodies, not ours’ before laying flowers in the freezer for the dead animals being sold there. They stood in an line trying to prevent shoppers from reaching packs of steak, mince, chicken, turkey and other meats at the supermarket in East Sussex, yesterday.   A protester with a loud speaker then began a speech, saying: “This Christmas time you might be worried about what presents to buy and how to organise family get togethers, but the animals are facing carnage. “Around ten million turkeys are slaughtered this time of year so they can end up on your Christmas table in the United Kingdom. “Catching and transporting birds can cause considerable pain and distress. “Many birds may be injured whilst being removed from sheds and put into crates. Poor handling frequently results in bruising, skin grazing and broken blood vessels. “Loaded into trucks, piled next to their friends and not knowing where they are headed, no chance of escape. “Transport to slaughter can be long with birds experiencing extremes of temperature, stress suffocation and shock.”   She then goes on to scream that birds are killed between nine and  weeks old when their natural le span is ten years. Eventually the police turn up, with an officer saying: I am still going to ask you all to leave as you are not allowed to be in here. I will advise you thatyou dont you will be liable to arrest. I am just being polite and respectful. You obviously have a cause you are quite passionate about but you can do it outside. Leaving the store, the group then set up a protest outside the store. DxE is an international movement with several UK subgroups. It says its actions are done to denormalise activities that involve animal exploitation through non-violent disruption. The Brighton group made headlines last month when they stormed the Touro steakhouse, playing the sounds of animals being slaughtered to shocked diners.

Alison Lewis, , from West Yorkshire, had to give up her baby boy when she was a teenager which saw her turn to junk food for comfort. By , Alisons weight had increased to st lbs after her eating spiralled out of control. However a year later, her son James Davis, , a farmer, managed to track Alison down but her frame was too large for him to hug her. But since undergoing a gastric bypass operation she has lost st lbs. Alison, a former factory worker, said: I was mortied that I was too fat for James to hug me. So I decided to lose weight and make him proud of me.  Alison was  when she gave birth to her son in September  but, seven weeks later, social services forced her to give up James for adoption. Alison says: James dad was out of the picture and social services thought I was too young. I felt like my heart was being ripped out. Afterwards, I fell into a deep depression and Id eat  biscuits, three chocolate bars and a large take away of chips at home on my own in one evening. I thought about James all the time, and food became my only comfort. Alisons weight piled on due to her unhealthy habits and, by June , she had put on st, weighing a whopping  stone and a size . Five years on in July , Alison met her partner Andy, , a hygiene operator.  Alison says: I was so unhappy with my body and how big Id let myself become but still used food as my comfort. In October , I was diagnosed with an abscess in my fallopian tubes. Doctors revealed I was infertile. I was absolutely heartbroken that Andy and I couldnt start a family of our own, so I ate even more food like takeaway fish and chips, and pizza. By September , Alisons ft in frame tipped the scales at st lbs and a size . She says: I struggled to even walk up a flight of stairs. Doctors warned I was obese, and at risk of having a heart attack and stroke. That month, Alison received a call from James adoptive father out of the blue. She says: He revealed that James wanted to meet me. They found my details from the adoption agency. At first I was speechless, then, I burst into tears. It was the happiest Id ever felt.  A month later in November , Alison travelled  miles to James house in Welshpool, Wales. Alison says: My heart was pounding out of my chest. In my head he was still a baby, but when I saw him he was a tall, strapping -year-old. His eyes were identical to mine and I couldnt believe how much he looked like me. When he went to hug me goodbye, I noticed he couldnt fit his arms around me. I was mortied. I knewI continued getting bigger, I would be dead before I could get to know him. That month, a dietician gave Alison a healthy eating plan and in December , her GP told her she was eligible for a gastric bypass operation on the NHS. Alison says: James was my new incentive. I ditched junk food and started eating steamed fish, vegetables, brown rice, fruit and salad. And I went to the gym five times a week. Five months later in May , Alison had lost a whopping st lbs and underwent her surgery at Dewsbury Hospital in Yorkshire. Alison says: I woke up from it battered and bruised, but I was so excited. All I could eat was liquid food and, three months after my op, I could manage tiny portions of scrambled eggs. I can only have small portions now, but it is worth it. It was hard, but James would text me saying he believed in me. I started seeing the numbers drop on the scales. And every time I saw James, he told me I looked slimmer. Now, nearly three years after my operation, I have lost st lbs. Im proud to say I now weigh st, and I fluctuate between a size  and . James and I text every day and see each other regularly.

Tiny Jordan Bleimeyer, five, was severely malnourished when he was freed from the abuse by his evil stepmother Tammi Bleimeyer and dad Bradley Bleimeyer. Now Jordans brother and sister - who testied against the couple - have revealed how they saved the young boys le in March , in a case which has shocked the world. Tammi, from Spring, Texas, was sentenced to  years in prison after starving the boy, forcing him to wear a nappy and making him sleep in a grimy closet.  The -year-old was found guilty of injury to a child by omission after her horrendous treatment of Jordan, who is now nine. Jordan was forced to sleep in a tiny space underneath the stairs, which was referred to as the Harry Potter room. Her son Cody, who was  at the time, told The Sun that he was stunned when he opened the door to the cupboard. Jordans face was caved in, he said, and he was covered in bruises.  Cody said: “If we hadn’t got him out that day I don’t think he would have survived. “The situation, the abuse, was bad before - there’s no doubt - but that day when I opened the door up and saw him I was in complete shock. “He looked like he was close to death. Cody, said Jordan could disappear for days on end, and told The Sun that the abusive couple were furious that he had opened the cupboard. He gave Jordan to sister Allison before confronting them, he revealed.  Both were arrested later in the day, and Jordan and his seven step-brothers and step-sisters were put in care. Allison said she one day hopes to resurrect her relationship with her mum, who she has not spoken to for more than four years, she can realise her faults and make amends. The crawlspace Jordan was kept in had exposed nails and wiring and the boy slept on a small mattress. Doctors said Jordan had nearly starved to death as he weighed just  pounds when he was saved. Medics compared his severe malnourishment to a Holocaust survivor.  Jordans father, Bradley Bleimeyer, was sentenced to  years behind bars after pleading guilty to the same charge. The abuse came to light when Tammis -year-old son reported her to the authorities in . He told officials that Jordan was being abused by his mother and stepfather, then . Bleimeyer - who was six months pregnant at the time - took Jordan from the home and refused towhen police arrived. But police tracked her to a nearby motel where they found her with Jordan. The boy was covered in bumps and bruises and was severely underweight. Jordan was rushed to hospital where a doctor said he has suffered severe physical abuse and habitual starvation. They said Jordan was close to death and would have died within dayshe hadnt been rescued. Details of the abuse emerged during the trial when prosecutors revealed Jordan was not allowed to eat at the dinner table with Belimeyers children. All he was given to eat each day was a slice of bread and it would be taken away it he didnt eat it quickly enough. Jordan was also allegedly drugged by his father to keep him quiet when people were in the house.

The three-year-old would run around the back of the house in New South Wales, Australia, and hide, before reappearing with a cheeky smile.At some point after the game started, his foster mum, who had also been outside the home, reportedly popped inside to make a cup of tea.The young children continued playing. But when William, wearing a Spider-Man costume, went down the side of the property again, he failed to reemerge. He had seemingly vanished into thin air. More than four years on, the youngster hasnt been seen since. The last known photo of him shows him letting out a roar, dressed in his superhero costume, as he draws with crayons on his grans veranda.Although the little boys disappearance from the scene in Benaroon Drive, Kendall, remains a mystery, it is believed he was abducted. Last year, a judge acknowledged the tragic probability that he is no longer alive. But now, it has been claimed that the boy could be living in a remote community in the outback, unbeknown to his devastated loved ones.Sue Nichols - the mother of a man who claims he could be Williams real father - told news.au that she believes the child is still alive.“I think [William] is living in a community somewhere out there, she said, adding that she thinks he is residing among Aboriginal kids.I think he’s still alive and that’s where he is. She continued: I hope he is. If it was my grandchild, I’d be out on the road looking for him andI found the person who took him I’d kill them. Sues son, Jacob Nichols, was the boyfriend of Williams biological mother, Karlie Tyrrell, in the year before the youngster was born.Although Williams biological dad is said to be Brendan Collins, Jacob has reportedly claimed he could be the childs father. The two men are said to have dated Karlie at around the same time in the year before the boys birth.When he was about eight months old, William was taken from Karlie and Brendan and placed with a foster family, according to local media.The night before his disappearance, he had arrived at his foster grans home early, along with his sister, as a surprise for her.The following morning, the two siblings were seen riding their bicycles in the driveway, with a neighbour hearing them playing. But not long after, he vanished during the hide-and-seek game. Somebody somehow managed to get him and disappeared down the road, neighbour Paul Savage, , told news.au.Williams mum, realising he was missing, asked his sister and granthey knew where he was, before desperately seeking help nearby.You could tell she was very distressed when she first came to us,” neighbour Anne-Maree Sharpley told The Sunday . “I just remember saying ‘Don’t worry, we’ll find him,’ and that has stuck with me because obviously they didn’t find him. She added that she waited with the mum as she called police.Following Williams disappearance, a large-scale search was launched and extensive investigations were carried out.  Hundreds of police officers, volunteers and a helicopter all joined in the search, which saw hundreds of tips sent in to authorities.Divers also searched nearby waterways.But there was no sight of the missing youngster.Williams biological parents were interviewed and dismissed as possible abduction suspects, with police also ruling out his foster parents. There is also no suggestion Jacob had anything to do with the incident.Last week, it emerged that an inquest into Williams disappearance will begin next March in the Sydney suburb of Lidcombe.It will take place at the Forensic Medicine and Coroners Court Complex, according to the NSW Justice Twitter account. Speaking to Channel Seven earlier this year, the tots foster mum said: We need to know where he is, and we need to know what happened to him, cause we cant live forever like this. Two years after William vanished, the states government offered a million reward for information leading to the childs recovery. However, he has yet to be found. Investigators have acknowledged the continued strength and courage of his families.They have been continuing to explore lines of inquiry in a bid to find out what happened to the youngster, Daily Mail Australia reports.According to Mr Savage, the little boy wouldnt go wandering.A Facebook page, called Wheres William Tyrrell  Bring Him Home - Official, has been set up in a bid to find the youngster.A post in September read: Today marks  tragic years since we last saw little William.  years of heartache and  years of endless tears for everyone who held him dear - not knowing where he is or what has happened to him. Today also marks the gt of unending love, hope and support from across Australia and around the globe. The inquest is expected to begin on March , .

In fact, not everyone even celebrates Christmas on December , and for them Christmas is even further away. Across the world, some countries celebrate Christmas on January  and use a whole host of traditions that are dferent from the Santa and his sleigh and mistletoe we are familiar with. These countries mark Christmas dferently because they use the Julian calendar rather than the Gregorian one. We take a look at the dferent days Christmas is celebrated across the world, as well as how traditions y. The Netherlands Here, the most important day of the festive season is December , when Sinterklaas, or St Nicholas, arrives by steamboat from his home in Spain. Until the th Century, Sinterklaas operated alone, bringing well-behaved children presents and apparently spiriting bad youngsters away in his sack for re-education and a beating. However, in , childrens author Jan Schenkman drew him with a black servant, who later became known as Zwarte Piet or Black Pete. It became Zwarte Piets job to go down the chimney to deliver presents and catch the less fortunate children.The land of ice and snow has no fewer than  Santa Clauses. Thirteen days before Christmas, the first Santa descends from the mountains and visits each house to put treats in childrens shoes while they sleep. Well-behaved children get presents such as mandarins and sweets, while bad kids typically receive something less attractive, such as a potato. The next day the second Father Christmas comes to town and so on. Then on December , the first one goes back, the next day the second one goes back. January  is called the thirteenth and is the last day of Christmas because that day the last Santa goes home. Germany  Here, Christmas Eve is the most important day of the festive season. Families traditionally mark the occasion with a feast and a visit to church for midnight mass. Some families will sing at Christmas but in general the mood is one of contemplation and reflection. Poland  For Polish children, theres less second guessing what they might receive on Christmas Day as presents can start arriving on December . Thats because this is St Nicholas Day, or Sw. Mikolaj Day and St Nicholas is known as the original Father Christmas. Unlike Santa in the UK, this character dresses in the white and gold of a Bishop, rather than red and white. Families traditionally enjoy  dishes - including the countrys famous pierogi dumplings - on Christmas Eve. The feast is preceded by Opłatek, a type of Christmas wafer.  Norway If you are living in Norway, the tradition is to exchange presents are exchanged on Christmas Eve. They are sometimes delivered by Santa Claus, although he goes by the name Julenissen. But gts also come in a more unique form - being brought by small gnomes called Nisse. And in contrast to the mince pies and whisky British children put out for Santa and Rudolf, many families in Norway will leave out rice porridge for the Nisse who are believed to watch over farm animals. They will also leave a sheaf of wheat out for birds to eat over Christmas.Argentina Argentinians decorate their homes with lights and wreaths and hang red and white garlands of flowers on their doors. Christmas trees are also popular and they are often decorated by December  - the feast of the Annunciation, when Christians remember when Mary was told she would have the baby Jesus. The Nativity scene, or pesebre, is also an important Christmas decoration in Argentina. Here, the main Christmas meal is eaten during the evening of Christmas Eve. Popular dishes include roasted turkey, roasted pork, stuffed tomatoes and Christmas bread and puddings like Pan Dulce and Panetone. People often set off fireworks at midnight and toast the start of Christmas Day. Russia Similar to other eastern European countries, families eat  dishes to represent the  apostles on Christmas Eve, including beetroot soup, fish and stuffed cabbages. They then attend Church and enjoy a Christmas meal on January , abiding by the Julian calendar.

I think we have a good mix just now.“Confidence is massive and, when you get that, you start trying things.

Maternity Grant it replaces.The Best Start Grant also provides pound for all subsequent children ndash meaning there is no cap on the number of children it supports, unlike the current UK government equivalent.In addition, two additional early years payments will be introduced by next summer.The first pound payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further pound when they start school.Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: \"I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support.\"I am particularly pleased that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister and had no support from the UK government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.\"With the Early Learning and School Age Payments this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide pound to pound more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit.\"Thats a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this governments emphasis on the early years.\"Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK government which was recently criticised by the United Nations Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts are causing.\"Who qualies bull The benefit will be wholly delivered by Social Security Scotland.bull Parents carers will be eligiblethey are the mother of the child, her partner, or have a young mother dependent on them.bull The benefits which

Amy had said she would fight for Connor to show the world what he was capable of.She said: “I definitely feel that we are now helping Connor to find his voice.“Since going to Sky Therapies in Wales in October, it has been amazing to see the dference in him.“The first day in at ABA it was looking at what he was capable of. What they were able to determine over the days was that he had the ability to talk, he just didn’t know how to do it.“They were saying actions like ‘touch your head’ and he would just look at them blankly. On the second day they would do the action and he would copy them and say it. By the third day they were able to say the command, not do the action and he would do it.“Even in the last couple of weeks,he has managed to learn all the colours which he hadn’t before.“I now find myself asking him what colour things are and he is telling me.”To raise the money the family put on a number of fundraising events and Amy took on the Loch Ness marathon in September.The funds were used to pay for the ABA therapy consultation in Wales and for the ABA therapists to see the youngster on a daily basis in Stonehaven.Connor’s siblings, Maddie, eight, and four-year-old Ritchie have been a huge help to him according to Amy.However, he is still considered a flight risk by the family.Amy said: “We had an incident in November where Connor had managed to run out of the house and he was actually found next to the train station in Stonehaven.“We have been sharing all our updates via our Facebook page Connor’s Voice, including when he went out.“We wanted people to see what the family can go through and what their money went on.“It has been amazing to see the support we have had from people, even in dferent parts of the country helping us raise the money.”Amy added that the family did feel bad for not working towards ABA sooner.During therapy, Amy said she spent most of the time with tears in her eyes and a lump in her throat as he spoke more during the sessions than he had in his whole le.She said: “We feel like we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.“It feels like Connor can now have a positive future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"north east charity sends out 6000 shoeboxes full of christmas gifts to those in need","story":"More than , shoeboxes full of Christmas gts have been sent out from the north-east.Over the past few weeks, members of Rotary clubs have been working with children from local schools to send Christmas present shoeboxes to families in poverty in Central and Eastern Europe.The scheme is a UK-wide project which has been run by Rotary clubs across the UK since  and is now a registered charity under The Rotary Shoebox Scheme.Last week, Aberdeen-based company Dyce Carriers, whose managing director is Jason Moir, helped to transport , boxes from the north-east to the main warehouse near Preston.Rotary district shoebox co-ordinator Ron McKail said: “What Rotary clubs achieve can only be done with the help of the schools, parents and children who support us each year.“Each box filled may be the only gt a child will receive.“The contribution made by Jason Moir and his staff at Dyce Carriers is immense.“Since , each year they have stored, packed and delivered shoeboxes at no cost to the Shoebox Charity.“In that time, they have palleted and transported over , shoeboxes.”The boxes include toys, toiletries, educational items or household goods, which provides a practical and useful present for people who may never have received a present."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/5c175d76af243-940x537.jpg ","title":"north east politicians dedicate christmas cards to deserving charities","story":"Politicians from across the north-east have shared their colourful Christmas card designs, with many helping the most vulnerable.Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart bought his Christmas cards from children’s charity Barnardo’s who support and protect children facing a wide range of issues.He said: “I volunteer in a local Barnardo’s shop before Christmas time and while I’m in I buy my cards there. Barnardo’s provide a great number of vital services and support for children in this city.”Aberdeenshire West MSP Alexander Burnett held a competition for primary school pupils to design his Christmas card. James Knox, a Primary  pupil at Clatt submitted the winning entry which shows a colourful living-room scene.Aberdeen North MP Kirsty Blackman said: “This year I’ve bought cards from Shelter, British Heart Foundation and Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland. It is upsetting to think that people are struggling to put food on the table. In an effort to help with the demand placed on local foodbanks, my office has been taking donations and will continue to do this throughout the year.“If you are in a position to donate, please spare a can or other non-perishable item and support a local foodbank.”North-east MSP Liam Kerr also asked pupils to send in their drawings, with Primary  pupil Lewis Masson, from Catterline School, crowned the winner with his snowman design.Meanwhile, Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin picked a design by Primary  Pitmedden School pupil Emma Stewart.She said: “It’s great to get the local community involved each year with Christmas cards. We received lots of entries and it was dficult to narrow it down.“Every pupil that took part showed creativity and flair and I’m delighted so many people wanted to contribute.”Aberdeen Donside MSP Mark McDonald chose not to send a Christmas card this year and instead made a donation to charity SensationALL, based at Westhill, who provide multi-sensory experiences for children and adults with disabilities, multiple support needs and their families.Mr McDonald said: “I have decided not to send out a Christmas card. I feel that too many cards are sent these days as force of habit rather than as a meaningful gesture.“I wanted to do something which would help make a dference in some way and so I chose to donate to SensationALL, a charity with whom I have close links and who I know do absolutely outstanding work supporting iniduals with multiple support needs and their families.”First Minister Nicola Sturgeon unveiled her Christmas card yesterday which features a photograph by photo-journalist Harry Benson CBE.The image of the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow will be auctioned next year with the proceeds going to four charities – Who Cares  Scotland, Maggie’s Centres, The Salvation Army Scotland and The Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice.The First Minister said: “I’m delighted to have such a beautul photograph from Harry Benson for my Christmas card this year.

Just keep hold of your ticket and claim on our website or mobile app.”Michael Hogg, RMT regional organiser for Scotland, said: “There was an agreement made, ScotRail reneged on that agreement and my members refused to work on rest days until such time as the issue was sorted out and addressed.“The issue is now resolved and we’ve got an agreement that training will be taken properly as opposed to carrying out the job and training at the same time.“There’s still a lot of training to be done by guard and driver members and this recent dispute really begs the question: ‘does ScotRail learn any lessons from any disputes ’“There are lessons to be learned because the RMT is not going to be messed about by an organisation that really should be investing not only in our railway, but also staff to ensure that they run it properly and safely.”North East MSP Lewis Macdonald criticised the service Aberdeen commuters have received.He said: “I am asking the question of the Scottish Government who are ultimately responsible for delivering a reliable train service.“Abellio is failing to deliver this requirement.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

And this type of attack has become all too common in Scotland.We all think our slobbering pooch would never be capable of attacking anything but, given the right circumstances, any dog, no matter how placid, will revert to instinct and could chase a farm animal. When in a state of excitement and aggression, a dog may then choose to attack a human being, and we are into another ball game entirely.The solution seems simple # keep control of your dog at all times and have it on a lead around livestock. As Brian Walker himself said, it is a very small minority of people who disregard these basic precautions, but that minority is growing in number.People love to moan about the dark days, wet weather and lack of entertainment.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

Elliott Summers, , of Bellesleyhill Road, Ayr, was found guilty after trial of the rape of a -year-old woman on July , last year. Judge Lord Kinclaven told first offender Summers: “You have been found guilty of a serious sexual offence and there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.” Summers, who was placed on the sex offenders register, worked at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as general manager for air traffic control and then in  became managing director at Norwich Airport in England. Recently he was working as a practice manager at a GP surgery in Glasgow. Solicitor advocate Murray Macara QC said: “He maintains he did not rape this woman and maintains that whatever sexual conduct took place was of a limited nature and was consensual. Mr Macara handed over a dozen testimonials from work colleagues of Summers. The QC said that his client objected to some of the comments in the background report compiled on him which referred to him a displaying toxic masculinity” and described him as a misogynist. Mr Macara said that Summers was highly thought of at work. He went on: “He worked as an air traffic controller and had senior managerial roles at two airports.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she arrived around .pm to pm and Summers, who was drunk, grabbed her and forcefully kissed her at the door. He told her that he had been drinking at the pub since .pm and she said he was so drunk he was unable to work the remote control for the television. Summers, then put his hand inside her bra, made a disparaging comment about her nipples and suggested that she looked older than . She said took her hand and took her into the bedroom which was pitch black and added: “I tried to push him away with both hands.

The womans daughter said her mother was distressed and crying and told her she had been raped and police were called. When quizzed by police Summers denied all responsibility for any rape and said that there was consensual sexual intercourse that evening.

He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":null,"title":"santa-is-ho-ho-hoping-to-spread-word-about-free-trishaw-rides-for-elderly","story":"Itrsquos not his usual mode of transport, but Santa is leaving his reindeer at home when visiting Peebles this month.Mr Claus will be ferried around the town on three wheels by his trusty little elf from am-pm every Saturday and Sunday from now until Christmas.And the reason he has taken time out of his very busy schedule, is to promote a very worthy cause which provides free bike rides for senior adults living in Peeblesshire.Cycling Without Agepedalled into Peebles a year ago, and it was long before willing passengers from residential and care homes were hopping on the purpose built trishaw, named Grace, and were whisked around the scenic town feeling the breeze in their hair whilst taking in the views.The trishaw will undergo operation Christmas sleigh transformation this weekend, as Cycling Without Age members publicise the work they do in the community whilst collecting donations to ensure the projectrsquos future.Steering group leader Jo Cunlfe, told us: ldquoBasically we have run this year as a pilot project to test the waters, get people trained up to ride the bike, and begin to make connections with community groups and iniduals who can use the service.ldquoWersquove only been operating one day a week.

My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes!

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

been supporting Campbeltown Sailing Club throughout the inception and evolution of Kintyre Seasports SCIO.#We are very pleased to see the project move forward to the current position where a broad range of partners and potential funders are actively engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of the Kintyre Seasports Project and remains committed to supporting its development for the future.#We commend the efforts of all in reaching this point and look forward to being a part of one of Scotland#s most innovative water sport developments.#The seasports initiative has boosted membership at Campbeltown Sailing Club from

He shows me his wedding ring, which is designed to look like a chain .He also shows me the coat of arms hersquos created for his family featuring a phoenixas well as a flag that stands for idealism. Tibbetts says the flag is a jokey nod towards his love of Doctor Who. If yoursquore true to your ideals, he says, you will never die, you will always be regenerated.:Mark Smith: The danger of lsquocriminalrsquo flags and why Irsquove changed my mind about the Union JackDay to day, Tibbetts main responsibilities at the Court of the Lord Lyon are to help communities create their own flagshe also deals with inquiries from the public and organisations that are interested in creating a flag. The Court of the Lord Lyon, based just off Princes Street, is mainly responsible for recording and protecting coats of arms as well as Scotlandrsquos national symbols , but it is also there to help create new ones. And, according to Tibbetts, there is an increasing interest in doing so.The most obvious example has been communities like Caithness and Orkney creating flags, and Tibbetts thinks there are a number of reasons for this trend. ldquoPartly itrsquos the way the world is, he says. ldquoThe more global the world becomes, the more important it is to understand your place in it. He cites the example of the flag of Barra, which gained prominence after the death of -year-old Eilidh MacLeod in the bombing at the Ariana Grande concert in . The flag was draped over Eilidhrsquos coffin when her body was repatriated to the island for her funeral and there is a campaign to have it officially recognised.Tibbetts also believes there is something particular about Scotland that makes us value symbols of identity. ldquoThere are two things in Scotland, he says. ldquoYou have a clan-based sense of identity. Also, there are hundreds of tartans and that has encouraged a deep and healthy sense of identity - Scotland isnrsquot just one thing, it is so many things underneath that build up to make this rich picture. There are a number of places that have a really strong national identity but itrsquos almost like itrsquos built on sand ndash therersquos very little underneath it. Whereas in Scotland it really is built on these strong foundations.Tibbetts sees his job as building on these foundations further and clearly loves what hersquos doing. The -year-old admits to me early on that hersquos always had a geeky interest in heraldry. ldquoIrsquom a massive geek, he says, ldquoand the more I talk, the more like Sheldon Cooper Irsquom going to sound. Growing up in Halesowen near Dudley, he specically remembers falling in love with Doctor Who. ldquoMy parents introduced me to Doctor Who when I was eight hoping it would keep me away from sex, drugs and rock and roll, he says, ldquoBut by the time I was  they were desperately hoping I would start to develop an interest in sex, drugs and rock and roll!Eventually, he moved to Scotland to study philosophy at St Andrews University, where he established a Doctor Who society and met his future we. He also began to develop his interest in heraldry, working on the universityrsquos graphic design team and developing a Tibbetts tartan that he could wear when supporting his we whos a Scottish country dancer. ldquoThat triggered me on to thinking, how do you develop these symbols  he says, ldquoHow do you make them useful :Revealed: the police list of flags that could be criminal offence to fly in ScotlandTibbetts has worked on those questions for about ten years, developing symbols for local communities before he was appointed to his new post at the Lyon Court in August. Hersquos now the go-to man on flags in Scotland, a kind of human wikipedia that you can fire questions at. I give it a try. Which is correct: Union flag or Union Jack  Both are correct, he says. What about the lion rampant ndash whatrsquos the status of that flag  Officially, he says, itrsquos a royal symbol that should only be flown by a representative of the crown. But he says hersquos not about to try to enforce that rule at Hampden on match day.I have another question: how aware is he of the negative side of flags and how do we ensure the symbols he loves donrsquot become a bad influence  Has he ever reflected on the problematic side of flags Of course he has, he says. ldquoItrsquos like any tool ndash it can be mis-used and by making more of tools that can be used negatively, am I doing a bad thing  It comes down to the system of using flags. If you were to focus solely on one flag, thatrsquos when the most toxic, negative elements come out. Whereas Irsquove seen places that start putting up their county flag and the Scotland flag and thatrsquos where you get the more pluralistic approach.ldquoA lot of the flags that are negative are political in origin, he adds, ldquowhereas what Irsquom trying to do is work with communities that donrsquot necessarily have any formal symbols to encourage the positive side. It would be easy to walk away, and say lsquotherersquos the ability to use these things for evil so no flagsrsquo. But thatrsquos not going to happen so without encouraging the positive, there will always be a negative.So what are his impressions about the status of the Union flag in Scotland  For many Scottish nationalists, itrsquos a negative symbol, but Tibbetts has a dferent take. ldquoIrsquove found the Union Jack to be on the whole a fairly positive symbol, he says. ldquoAnd I thinkanything has done anything positive for the Union Jack, itrsquos the  Olympics. He is aware, of course, he says, that there are political connotations to the Union Jackyou are looking through a particular prism, but he believes the flag has never been so positively used as it is now, even in Scotland. ldquoThe Union Jack is alive and well, he says, ldquobecause it isnrsquot just a flag anymore - itrsquos a pop culture icon. If the United Kingdom stopped existing for political reasons, orit just sank into the sea, the rest of the world would continue using the flag.Tibbetts has a similar positive impression of the saltire, and he feels it personally as a man who was brought up in England but has many connections to Scotland and now lives and works here.ldquoI still find the saltire very positive, he says. ldquoItrsquos the symbol of Scotland and now I have a Scottish we and a Scottish daughter, so I think of myself as very tied to Scotland. I will use it and I do use it and I encourage everyone to use it.In fact, Tibbetts, the go-to man on flags in Scotland, has a kind of mantra about the saltire that he thinks we should all stick to. He canrsquot control who uses the flag, he says. But he can control how he uses it. ldquoIt almost doesnrsquot matter how other people abuse it, he says. ldquoItrsquos my flag. This is our symbol.Career highThe registration of the Caithness flag has been a key success. This was the first mainland community flag in Scotland.Career lowIn my very first flag campaign after promoting my own design, a flag that failed several flag design basicswas chosen. However, this was a good early lesson as it taught me that it was more useful to promote good design principles and to provide communities with the tools to develop their own symbols.Favourite musicThe Moody Blues - I love the progressive, symphonic sound and their themes of philosophy and child-like wonder.Last book readSince the birth of my daughter last year Irsquove struggled to finish any book and even read any fiction at all.

Prince Harry has taken part in the event for more than  years but, according to reports at the weekend, he will not attend this year.Harry also, you may remember, failed to appear at the summer grouse shoot at Balmoral this year, reportedly because he doesnrsquot want to upset Meghan, who opposes blood sports. This is quite a moment: suddenly, at the heart of the Royal Family we have someone who objects to one of the things they love doing most: killing animals.The obvious question is whether Meghanrsquos opposition will change anything and we should probably admit that, in the short term, it wonrsquot ndash the Royals arenrsquot about to put down their guns because of the new American member of the family.However, longer term, Meghanrsquos personal stand is part of a wider trend thatrsquos starting to put pressure on shooting, particularly driven grouse shooting. In the last few days, wersquove had a think-tank report that challenges some of the economic claims made for grouse moors. A Scottish Government inquiry is also going on into the environmental impact of grouse moor practices and whether they can be made sustainable. There is a long way to go, but maybe, at last, the first hawks are starting to circle above the shooters.The shooters themselves normally defend what they do by claiming that shooting provides jobs and is a good economic use of the land but the report from the Common Weal think-tank has exposed that as untrue. The report compares grouse shooting to forestry, renewable energy, horticulture and tourism and concludes grouse shooting is the least economically effective. It also tackles the job claims: it takes  hectares to provide one job on a grouse moor, it says, compared to just  for forestry and three for horticulture. When you consider grouse moors cover  per cent of Scotland, thatrsquos a lot of land not being used to its full potential.However, the economic arguments ndash powerful as they are ndash are only part of the story. As everyone knows, the ideal grouse moor from the point of view of landowners and gamekeepers is one that is pretty much devoid of any predator, which leads to predator control on a mass scale ndash legal and illegal.The them-and-us atmosphere in shooting is also unpleasant ndash for months now, Irsquove been speaking to people within shooting who are concerned about the cruel and brutal way that some gun dogs are trained, but they are too afraid to go public because they know they will be shunned and their careers will effectively be over.There is also a disturbing imbalance at the heart of shooting, which I saw for myself at the Scottish Game Fair in Scone. Everyone at the event kept saying how shooting was for everyone and I remember one gundog trainer telling me how he had trained a dog for a Russian oligarch and a postie from Dundee.However, my impression I have to say was that the shooters were made up of two distinct groups: the aristocrats, the wannabe aristocrats and the well-off at one end and, at the other end, the people who work for them: men, and itrsquos mostly men, who work as keepers or beaters for not very much money. This class-ridden problem with shooting is just another reason to dislike it ndash and I rather relish the idea that it could be a duchess who helps draw attention to it.Irsquom also hopeful that Meghan Marklersquos opposition to shooting may help to change the narrative in Scotland and in particular help the Scottish Government to stop waffling and actually do something about grouse moors. The Governmentrsquos inquiry into the moors, chaired by Professor Alan Werritty, is a good start, but itrsquos based on a flawed premise that the Glorious th can actually be glorious and that grouse shooting can be made acceptable. Professor Werritty is explicitly looking for ways in which grouse moors can continue to be a part of the rural economy instead of questioning the idea of the grouse moor itself and whether something that harms the countryside should be part of the countryside.Irsquom also not entirely convinced that the Scottish Government really gets the argument on animal welfare. A few weeks ago, I accused the Government of hypocrisy for condemning Larysa Switlyk, the American photographed with a goat shersquod killed on Islay, while also supporting the culling of goats, seals, hares and other animals and failing to act on grouse moors, and the response I got from Roseanna Cunningham, the minister in charge of animal welfare, was disappointing. Ms Cunningham cited the Werritty Group and said it would be examining how grouse moors could be made sustainable and compliant with the law, but she obviously isnrsquot willing to look at the issue at a deeper level and ask whether we should question the very existence of grouse moors.Which leaves us in a curious situation in which the Duchess of Sussex appears to be making a better stand on grouse shooting than the minister in charge of the issue in Scotland. I donrsquot want to exaggerate what Meghan Markle has done of course, but the Royal Family can, and often does, reflect wider social changes and the hope must be that it has started ndash in a very small way ndash to do the same on hunting. My advice to Harry would be to listen to what his we is saying ndash she talks a lot of sense. My advice to the Scottish Government is to listen to the growing unease about hunting ndash and do something about it."},{"url":null,"title":"sse-and-npower-call-off-merger-blaming-government-price-cap-and-challenging-market-conditions","story":"The companies said the deal has been affected by multiple factors, including the performance of their businesses, clarity on the final level of the Governments default tarf cap and changing energy market conditions.:SSE and Npower merger provisionally cleared by regulatorSSE said: \"These implications meant the new company would have faced very challenging market conditions, particularly during the period when it would have incurred the bulk of the integration costs.\"The two firms had been hoping to seal the merger of their retail operations in the first quarter of  after it was recently given the green light by the competition watchdog.But only last month, SSE admitted there was \"some uncertainty\" over whether the merger with npower would go ahead after the pair delayed the tie-up due to the incoming cap on default tarf prices.SSE will now consider a standalone demerger and listing, a sale or an alternative transaction for its household energy ision.Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: \"This was a complex transaction with many moving parts.

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What followed instead has been chaos.Unprecedented is an overused word, but at the moment it is the only one that we have which even begins to explain the magnitude of the screw-up this Conservative Government has perpetrated.They are not alone of course. The Labour Party is equally chaotic and ided, while the SNP is intent on squeezing every smidgen of advantage possible out of this for their never-ending independence crusade, regardless of the bigger picture or implications for us all.Inidually there are politicians in each of those parties, and my own, who are putting the national interest first and looking for a solution.But, taken in the round, the impression this debacle is creating not just in the world’s media, but among the electorate to whom we are answerable, is incredibly damaging.For me, it’s time to think about doing things dferently before we run out of time and crash out of the EU, without a deal, and into economic disaster. We need to find consensus. Common ground. In reality, it is there already. Every day, politicians from each party talk to each other about how we get out of this mess. How we fix it. Be in no doubt, most of us know it needs fixed. And quickly.Increasingly, Labour, SNP and even some Conservatives are coming around to the Liberal Democrat view that we need to give this back to the people for the final say. A People’s Vote on the deal.But first, there is an enormous roadblock to get past. We need to find a proposal that Parliament can agree and give the people an option to vote on. And, for me, that must include the word ‘remain’.The only deal we’ve had so far won’t cut it. It has many flaws, but chief among them is the backstop.: Kevan Christie: What Plato had to say about BrexitThis year marked the th anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. For two decades, the violence which shook so many families during the Troubles has largely been kept at bay.The efforts made in the peace process by all communities should be applauded, not undermined. But that is exactly what the ham-fisted, chaotic tactics of this Government threaten to do.I am happy to accept that was not their intention. But sadly it may be the impact.The Prime Minister’s “cake and eat it” style of Brexit negotiation was always going to lead us up this particular proverbial creek without a paddle. On the one hand, the Government committed itself to avoiding a hard border, yet, on the other, they were adamant on departing from both the customs union and the single market.And so we are left with the bizarre half-in half-out arrangement known as the backstop, which would mean Northern Ireland staying in the customs union for an indefinite period of timean appropriate customs agreement cannot be agreed with Brussels by the end of the transition period in .And, as it was revealed once the Government was forced to publish legal advice put together by the Attorney General, this arrangement could last indefinitely.Unsurprisingly, Unionists in Northern Ireland don’t like it. The people of Northern Ireland, like those in Scotland and London, voted overwhelmingly to remain.And they and the rest of the UK did not vote for separating off Northern Ireland while the rest of the country is torn from the single market and customs union.The reality is that there is currently no version of Brexit that will work for Northern Ireland, or for the rest of us for that matter.: Brexit: Imperial dreams leading to Little Britain – Kenny MacAskillThe most optimistic of Theresa May’s supporters did see a glimmer of hope in the European Council this weekend, with reassurances from the other countries that, of course, they would look for a quick solution. But that was quickly extinguished.Instead we are left with an unfinished debate on withdrawal, a deal on which parliament has not voted and will not approve, the potential of a no-confidence vote this week and just three months to find and implement a decision.The time is long past when there was room to indulge the no-deal fantasies of the European Research Group. It’s also too late for the determined Brexiteers in the Tory party to find another deal, or another leader.It’s time to admit they got it wrong. They led the people up the garden path with the promise of a smooth, easy, economically booming Brexit which simply doesn’t exist.Do I want to stay in the EU  Yes. But more importantly I want us all to have the choice, now that we know what Brexit really means. Today I’ll get on another flight at Edinburgh Airport and head back to Westminster for another week of, well, who can really be sure The Labour Party might finally table that vote of confidence. This weekend’s gossip and speculation might mean we have even more chaos. Or maybe, just maybe, the more sensible voices will prevail, and we will find a way to reach the consensus that the country needs.

It was a simple message that voters could understand. Find a copy of the SNP manesto for the  general election and you’ll see it prominently on the front cover. “Independence in Europe - make it happen now!”Alex Salmond and his supporters pushed the party to embrace a more pro-European stance following his election as leader in .They believed membership of the evolving European Union offered Scotland the chance to move from being part of the UK to joining the EU club of nations.: Second referendum on EU membership “would damage politics”Under plans drawn up in Brussels in the s, EU nations were about to open their borders and fully commit their economies to the Single Market.While it was never the intention of the EU technocrats, this move towards integration meant that one of the oldest and most potent arguments against Scottish independence - that it would lead to border patrols at Berwick - was severely undermined. If an independent Scotland retained its EU membership alongside the rest of the UK, the SNP countered, there could be no hard border along the Cheviot Hills.“Scotland will have open borders with England,” the SNP manesto for the  general election claimed. “European countries have abolished internal frontiers and our close family and trading ties with England will not be interrupted in any way by Scottish independence.”This remained one of the party’s core messages on independence up to and including the  referendum.Along comes BrexitThat changed when a majority of voters across the UK - but not in Scotland - voted to leave the EU in . Suddenly, a key plank of SNP strategy dating back two decades had been removed.Presuming Brexit takes place as planned, Scotland will leave the EU alongside the rest of the UK. The old certainties of European membership will come to an end. Borders - as the on-going row over Northern Ireland proves - have become a live issue.If a majority of Scots were to vote in favour of independence at a future date, the new state created will start le outwith the EU. One of the immediate priorities for any Scottish government would then be to secure trade across its only land border.“An independent Scotland works wellboth Scotland and England are in the EU, but with England outside the EU, Scotland probably needs a bespoke deal with the EU rather than EU membership,” said Professor John Kay, a former economic advisor to the Scottish Government, in an interview with The Sunday Times.“The nature of that deal depends on the unknown trade deal between the UK England and the EU. As with all of the EU debate, it is actually about the complex detail that politicians and the general public would prefer not to engage with - which is the source of our current misery.”A hard border The Scottish Conservatives believe that the SNP failed to deal with the border question in , long before Brexit.“It was made perfectly clear during the  campaign that a hard border would be requiredScotland and England had dferent arrangements in relation to the EU,” a party spokesman told The Scotsman. “Given the UK is leaving the EU in March, and given it’s stated SNP policy for an independent Scotland to join the EU, it’s dficult to see how a hard border could be avoided.”The SNP believe Brexit - and the chaotic way it has been handled by the UK Government - strengthens the overall case for Scottish independence. They say independence would be the “opposite” of Brexit - putting emphasis on cooperation, not throwing up borders.“Brexit threatens to take Scotland out of a market eight times the size of the UK market alone, doing massive damage to jobs, investment and living standards,” a party spokesman said.“In , the people of Scotland were explicitly told that the only way to protect our place in Europe was to vote against independence. That has now been utterly exposed for the lie it always was.“Independence is the opposite of Brexit – it is about cooperating with friends and neighbours, not throwing up barriers, and that is the principle which will guide an independent Scotland.”: Brexit referendum ‘harms case against second independence vote’©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845234.1545063512!/image/image.jpg","title":"defiant theresa may dares labour to try topple government","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May has dared Labour to try and topple her government after she announced the Commons would not vote on her proposed Brexit deal until the middle of January, just a week before a crucial legal deadline.Jeremy Corbyn said it was “unacceptable that we should be waiting almost a month before we have a meaningful vote on the crucial issue facing the future of this country” and lodged a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister.Brexit: Would an independent Scotland face a hard border with England However, he was criticised by Nicola Sturgeon and fellow opposition leaders for stopping short of a pushing for a confidence vote in the government that could trigger a general election.Downing Street effectively dared Labour to mount a full attempt to topple the government, after refusing to give Mr Corbyn’s motion parliamentary time to be debated.Labour’s motion was not put forward under legislation that determines when the UK holds general elections, and would not have collapsed the government. “There is a method under the Fixed Term Parliament ActMPs want to express no confidence in the government,” a Number  source said.Amid continuing turmoil at Westminster, the First Minister is expected in London tomorrow and is likely to meet Mrs May to urge her to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It will be Ms Sturgeon’s third visit for Brexit talks in a month.There was confusion as Labour sources briefed in the run-up to the Prime Minister’s statement that a confidence motion would be brought forward, only for that to change when Mrs May announced a date for the meaningful vote. At the end of her statement, however, Mr Corbyn changed his mind, catching his own deputy leader off guard.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell claimed Labour had won a “victory in forcing the Prime Minister to set a date for the meaningful vote”, but claried: “Jeremy has taken the sense of the House of Commons which is clearly demanding a vote this week. Fair enough, we’re now going for it.”After the motion was lodged, Ms Sturgeon tweeted: “Labour tabling a motion just in the PM rather than in the entire government begs the question, which Tory do they want to see as PM ”Earlier, she had accused Labour of “acceding” to the government’s timetable and “allowing them to waste another month”. “When there are only three months left to avert disaster, that’s really not excellent tactics,” she added.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable accused Mr Corbyn of “bottling” a real confidence vote.Senior pro-Brexit rebels who tried to oust the Prime Minister last week said they would back her against Labour’s attempt to embarrass her.Tory MP Steve Baker said: “Eurosceptic Conservatives are clear that we accept the democratic decision of our party to have confidence in Theresa May as PM.” A European Research Groupsource added that its members would “of course be voting with the government on this meaningless Labour motion”, and the DUP signalled they would also back the Prime Minister.Updating the Commons on a turbulent summit in Brussels last week, Mrs May told MPs that “some of the resulting exchanges at this Council were robust”.She insisted she “faithfully and firmly reflected the concerns of this House over the Northern Ireland backstop” and claimed the EU had committed that the controversial provision in the Brexit deal could be avoided and would only be temporary.“I can confirm today that we intend toto the meaningful vote debate in the week commencing  January and hold the vote the following week,” Mrs May told MPs.The Labour leader said the vote should have been held before Christmas, accusing Mrs May of “dither and delay”.He told her: “A responsible prime minister would, for the good of this country, put this deal before the House this week so we could move on from this government’s disastrous negotiation”.The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said it was “time to call time on this government” and taunted Mrs May: “Where is the leadership  We thought the Prime Minister had reached rock bottom, but she’s still digging.”The SNP secured an emergency debate on the decision to put off last week’s vote on the Brexit deal, which could take place today.Meanwhile, Cabinet ministers continued to openly speculate about how to proceedMrs May’s deal is rejected, despite Downing Street denials that any plan B is being considered. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said it was important to find out the “will of parliament”, while Business Secretary Greg Clark also appeared to back an indicative vote to find out what –anything – MPs could support.In a bid to keep the Prime Minister’s deal alive, Downing Street said talks in Brussels were continuing “at all levels”.But the European Commission’s chief spokesman said no further meetings are expected. He said in Brussels: “The deal that is on the table is the best and the only deal possible.” ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4844720.1545042947!/image/image.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn scottish government must do more to end two child benefit cap","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The #cruel# two-child benefits cap must be brought to an end in Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn has said.Speaking in Edinburgh yesterday at a Christmas lunch attended by people who have experienced poverty, Labour’s Westminster leader described the cap as “inhumane” and said that much more must be done to tackle the issue of deprivation in the country.The cap was introduced by the UK government in  and limits tax credits and Universal Credit to a family’s first two children.Mr Corbyn said: “The two-child cap is inhumane across the whole of the UK and Scotland has the power to lt it.“It penalises larger families and also, what’s the message to third, fourth and fth children in large families, do they matter less than the first and second child  I say this with some feeling as I was the fourth of four children.“A Labour government in Westminster will completely redesign social security, but the Scottish Government has the power to make a dference to people’s lives right now.“The SNP need to stop enforcing this Tory policy, end the cruelty, and protect ­families in Scotland from the two-child cap.”Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard raised the issue at First Minister’s Questions at Holyrood on Thursday.Mr Leonard said that the cost of scrapping the policy in Scotland would represent . per centof the budget announced by Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last Wednesday.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon responded by stating that it would not be affordable to lt the cap.She said: “This government does everything it can to mitigate UK welfare cuts. We’re spending in the region of £m every year to do that The fact that we cannot mitigate every cut is not a lack of political will, it’s a fact of basic arithmetic.“We don’t hold the budget for reserved areas of welfare so every penny of mitigation has to come from another area of our responsibilities.“We’ve used our tax powers and we’ve allocated all of the resources at our disposal.”The Scottish Government, as a minority government, must seek cross-party supportits budget is to pass. A deal was agreed with the Greens last year, however the party has refused to commit its supportmore funding for local government is not provided.Richard Leonard insisted the SNP will not receive support for its budget unless major changes are made to address the issue of child poverty.“I was told by Nicola Sturgeon it’s a question of arithmetic, I think it’s a question of politics and priorities,” said Mr Leonard.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4844668.1544898647!/image/image.jpg","title":"library snaps up rare sylvia plath poem first published by scottish printer","story":"She is the American writer widely regarded as one of the greatest poets of the th century.He is a little-known Scottish publisher who worked with a private printing press for more than half a century.Now the role played by Alan Anderson, a banker turned bookseller, in helping to get Slyvia Plath’s career off the ground is finally being recognised.The National Library of Scotland has acquired the first work Plath had published in her own right – thanks to an offer of help from Anderson.Just  copies of a four-page pamphlet featuring Plath’s poem, A Winter Ship, were made at his workshop in Edinburgh at her request in .It is thought the writer sent the poem to family and friends inside Christmas cards. It was said to have been inspired by the waterfront in her native Boston, where she and husband Ted Hughes were living when she wrote the poem.The couple had moved to London by the time her pamphlet was published in  by Anderson’s one-man Tragara Press outfit, after Plath had been impressed by proofs he had sent her.Anderson ended up publishing Plath’s poem after initially writing to Hughes to express his admiration about his work.After being sent samples showing how the poem would appear in print, Plath wrote to Anderson, telling him: “I am writing on my own behalf to say how delighted my husband and I were with the proofs of A Winter Ship. I’m sending back the one we like best, with the border round it. “We thought we’d like the date, place and press in upright letters, as on the other proof, and my name deleted – as I’ll write that on the inside myself, with Christmas greetings too.”The National Library hopes the acquisition of the poem will raise greater awareness of Anderson, who was still operating his printing press at his home in the Highlands shortly before he died in  at the age of .Born in Fe in , he started his working le as a banker and took up a post with an antiquarian bookseller in Edinburgh after serving in the Royal Navy, before buying his own bookshop.Anderson would go on to publish an anthology of work by Barry Humphries, the Australian writer and actor best known for creating the character Dame Edna Everage.Graham Hogg, rare books curator at the National Library, said: “Alan Anderson had a private press so he just did what he wanted and when he wanted. He wasn’t actively going out and touting for work. He was never in it for the money – it was a hobby and a passion for him.“Alan Anderson mostly published small pamphlets for contemporary poets that he was interested in. He only really printed work that he liked or work for friends.“This particular one came about when he wrote to Ted Hughes to say how impressed he was by a short story he had written and askedhe had anything  and would be happy to print it. Ted Hughes wrote back to him and said that his we was writing poetry and askedhe could publish something. I doubt any money would have changed hands at all. They were never intended for public sale. “It’s very much a curio as she actually sent them out in their Christmas cards. He had sent her two proof copies and she chose the one she liked.”Born in Boston in , Plath met Hughes in  when she was studying at Cambridge University and they married a few months later. However, they had a tempestuous relationship and after Hughes met another woman in  he split with Plath, who had been troubled with mental illness for years.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true.

Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities.A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly. Firstly, in a bid to reduce ‘fast fashion’ a fancy-dress option will be available to participants with the focus on homemade outfits. And in a bid to encourage participation and make the event less competitive, prizes on the day will be only awarded to the best-dressed participants. These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course. Donations to the Crossroads Carecharity can also be made via the Skye Santa Dash website.The two-mile Skye Santa Dash fun run is open to people of all abilities and begins at . pm from Somerled Square in Portree on Saturday th December.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated.

Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium.

His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new report lays out bright future for west belfast","story":"A NEW report detailing the positive transformation that has taken place in West Belfast in recent years will be launched on tomorrow morning . ‘Vision : Transforming West Belfast’ will look to the future as well as outlining projects such as the James Connolly Interpretive Centre, Casement Park and the Roddy McCorley Society interactive museum and visitor centre.The report has been commissioned by Fáilte Feirste Thiar and the West Belfast Partnership Board and will highlight the amount of investment that has gone into the West of the city.Projects in the spotlight in the report include:•£m from Belfast City Council for the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre•m from the Department for Communities and Ciste for Áras na BhFál• £m for the Balmoral Hotel•£.m for the Blackmountain Shared Space Project•£m investment for Brook Leisure Centre•£m for the Falls Park City Cemetery MasterplanIn total, the report will list  projects in West Belfast that have benefited from investment.Speaking to the Andersonstown News ahead of the launch, Harry Connolly, Executive Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, said: “In recent years West Belfast has began to secure increased amounts of public sector investment.“Research undertaken for this publication has uncovered that this combined investment totals over £ million – a signicant figure.“Many people involved in our local private, public and community sectors will not be fully aware of the huge amount of work involved nor the scale of the investment secured.

He’s now been issued with a summons and was due to appear in court on Wednesday morning – but the hearing was adjourned for the second time.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, a gobsmacked Seamus said: “I’ve kept horses all my le, they are beautul creatures. I am in poor health and looking after these horses brings me a real sense of joy.”Seamus lives with COPD, is diabetic and has suffered multiple heart attacks.He continued: “I was giving bread to the horses, minding my own business, and these two characters approached me and demanded I stopped. This field belongs to my friend and I have permission to feed these horses. What harm was I doing  I don’t need the stress and strain of this.”Seamus described the encounter that led to the series of events that has left him baffled and angry.“I pulled my car up that morning and walked over to feed the horses, these two fellas shouted over at me and told me to stop. I told them to take themselves off, they said they were ringing the peelers and I told them to get whoever they wanted. One of the men said the birds were lting the bread I was feeding the horses and dropping it in his garden, absolute nonsense. I got into my car and drove off. Your man must have taken my car registration because I received a fixed penalty notice in the post.”Seamus added: “I turned up to court on the arranged date and the complainant never bothered turning up. I showed up again on Tuesday and the same thing, he never weighed in again. NowI didn’t bother turning up I’m sure they’d have something to say about that. This is a complete and utter waste of Belfast City Council time and money and I am urging them to drop it.”Local People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said: “This whole situation is ridiculous, whoever made the decision to issue a court summons to Seamus perhaps needs a basic crash course in what constitutes illegal or criminal behaviour. This summons should be withdrawn and Belfast City Council should apologise to Seamus immediately.“It’s also worth saying that Seamus is taking this in his stride and isn’t backing down – and fair play to him for that. But other people would likely be intimidated by this. Nobody wants brought up in front of a court and especially for something so absurd. I’d imagine the vast majority of people would agree with me that Belfast City Council and the powers-that-be in this city ought to put their time and energy into something more productive, instead of hauling a pensioner up in front of a court for feeding horses.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said that as this is an ongoing matter they would not be making any comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the fureys uniting generations through music","story":"DESPITE its relatively small population, ours has never been a country with a shortage of musicians on the international stage, but few of them have had an impact as lasting as The Fureys.Formed in the , the iconic folk group has entertained audiences throughout the world for  years. While the band’s line-up has inevitably changed over the years, brothers George and Eddie Furey have continued to tour the globe, bringing the finest ballads to generations old and new.To celebrate their th anniversary they have released a new album, ‘The Fureys  Years On… to be continued’, and will play a headline gig at Belfast’s Waterfront this January.Ahead of the gig, the Andersonstown News met with George and Eddie, who had just ed from the Netherlands leg of their jubilee tour. While their music has touched thousands,not millions of people, George and Eddie are a pair without air and graces. Our chat was an informal one that took place in the Waterfront Hall’s lobby, with school kids, excited by their trip to the panto, providing an excitable background hum. As for the story of The Fureys – it’s one of famous faces, infamous sessions, and more years worth of craic than can be adequately depicted in a single newspaper article. However, with the release of their new album – which foregoes many of the obvious tracks and is jammed full of new material – our conversation almost immediately turned to things more current.“A lot of the songs we would’ve heard as kids and would’ve grown up singing them,” Eddie explained.“Streets of London is one of them, which was written by Ralph McTell, and we know Ralph going back many, many years.”George added: “The first track on the album was written by a Donegal man, Jordy Gallagher, and he wrote the song about eight years ago. “Joe, our manager knows him very well and he gave our manager the song to have a listen to because he thought it might suit on the album because it’s a protest song. A lot of those songs from years ago are all protest songs, from the s.“We grew up with all these protest years ago. There was a great song years ago called The Eve of Destruction, and it’s about what would happen to ussomeone dropped the big bomb – we grew up with those songs. So this song really suits the album.”“The Day’s Gonna come is a great song,” Eddie concurred. “The song tells you what’s happening to the world and those older songs tell you what was happening at that time. The words are ‘the day is gonna come when the water runs out and the wells run try, man’s so dumb, fish can’t swim and birds can’t fly’.”He continued: “There’s also peace songs, love songs, and drinking songs. “We’ve sang an awful lot of love songs over the years too. Songs that our mother used to sing and our father used to sing, Sweet Sixteen and that sort of stuff.”Although it’s an anniversary album, the new CD is new territory for The Fureys, who had not previously recorded much of its material. But much like their previous albums, The Fureys have continued to record songs from some of world’s best songwriters.“The songs are mostly from people we’ve met over the years on our tours,” Eddie said.“We’ve sang a lot of great ballads over the years.“We even recorded an album of Charlie Chaplin songs. Josie, Charlie Chaplin’s second youngest daughter, was cleaning out her father’s house and she found five songs that were never recorded before, written by Charlie Chaplin, and she asked uswe would do the songs. We had to do them, and we had to do them with an orchestra. We had a -piece orchestra in the studio with us recording these great songs.”George added: “We do a mix of stuff – not just Irish songs. If you listen to some of the bands now they’re going back on the old stuff. To me, you can’t beat the real thing.”Unlike some older musicians and music fans, The Fureys are not consumed with thoughts of past ‘glory days’. On the contrary, George admits that music is “probably more versatile now”. Instead the past only serves to make their current concerts more fulfilling as they bring together people who have followed them through the generations.“A lot of the kids that come to see us now, their grandparents or parents would’ve come to our concerts and bought our albums,” George said. “Now we have kids coming to concerts with their grandma and grandpa.”Eddie noted: “People grew up with our stuff and they love to see it live.”The Fureys have united generations and their music has been played everywhere from their hometown in Dublin to the International Space Station – where astronaut Chris Hadfield famously played their track ‘Steal Away’ – but of all other places outside of their hometown, it’s in Belfast where they feel most at home.“We’ve been up here so many times it’s like our second home,” George insisted.“We used to play in the Ulster Hall before this was built. We used to bring the wives up to do the Christmas shopping, because it was cheaper up here. Then we’d smuggle it across the border. If you got caught at customs they’d take it off you – drink and everything – party time. We had some parties like.”He continued: “This is our tenth gig here, which I never knew until this morning. It was only opened up when we first played here. They know what to expect – people are used to coming to see us. They always ask for some of the old songs, and we have to do them. People will ask for some dferent songs too, and we can do them no problem.”Eddie added: “We’ll be singing some songs off the new album too. You have to add them in here and there. If a request comes up for an old song we like to keep people happy.”The Furey’s play at the Waterfront Hall on January , .

Everybody has to know the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.”In a commons statement on Monday, Mrs May said the EU had assured her the backstop was \"not a plot to trap\" the UK.\"EU leaders could not have been clearer: They do not want to use this backstop, they want to agree the best possible future relationship with us, there is no plot to keep us in the backstop,\" she said.\"These commitments have legal status and should be welcomed as they go further than the EU ever previously has in trying to address the concerns of this house.\"She added that and MPs would resume the debate on her Brexit deal on January  and a new vote on the deal will be held the following week, beginning January ."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast mans first christmas with birth mum ruined by gangs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Labour will try to force Brexit vote before Christmas  Bertie Ahern: Ireland cant give an inch on avoiding hard border  Blair: May is irresponsible to try and steamroller her deal through The routes are understood to include country lanes, private roads, rights of way across private lands and other unmarked access points leading into Northern Ireland that could be potential smuggling routes.The highly sensitive work was conducted by members of the Defence Forces, working with gardai. It involved physical mapping of the Border by army personnel along with desk-top work and was completed in recent months.Defence Forces are in continual mapping of Irelands Border for security purposes, such as during the Foot  Mouth disease outbreak  years ago The latest exercise is regarded as particularly signicant in light of the potential security risks posed by Brexit.The updated map of the frontier will form a key part of the security services contingency planning for a doomsday scenario that could follow Britain plunging out of the EU without a deal.The last official report on the Border identied  official crossing points. That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit.

They are contained in the conclusions of yesterday evening.“That is our position. That is what we have put on the table. And now we expect Great Britain to respond.”Belgium’s PM Charles Michel said: “The ball is now politically in the British court.”And Mr Tusk said he had “no mandate” to organise any further negotiations.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over  months.It seems that the Prime Minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her Brexit deal. We cannot go on like this. The Prime Minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let Parliament take back control.— Keir StarmerDecember , The Prime Minister addressed the EU leaders on Thursday about MPs’ concerns  about the backstop which had prevented her getting her Brexit deal through Parliament this week.Mr Tusk said the leaders had expressed a “firm determination” to work “speedily” to ensure there is an agreement on the future relationship in place by the time the transition period ends in December , so the backstop is not needed.But Mr Juncker criticised Britain’s lack of clarity over what it was seeking from the future relationship.“Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want,” he said.“So we would like, within a few weeks, our UK friends to set out their expectations for us because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarications.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker embraces council president Donald Tusk at the Brussels summit The EU hardball approach appears to leave Mrs May with limited room for manoeuvre during the countdown to the UK’s departure on March .The Prime Minister told the summit that a package of assurances around the backstop could “change the dynamic” at Westminster.At the same time, she made clear a failure by EU leaders to offer concessions risked the collapse of the whole agreement, with the UK leaving in March in a disorderly, no-deal Brexit.Mrs May managed a smile at her press conference when a reporter askedshe had had a “trying week”, jokingly replying: “Has something happened this week ”When asked whether the problems with her party at home and dealing with the EU had made her want to quit as leader, she said it is “our duty as a Government and as a Parliament” to see Brexit through.WATCH LIVE: PM @Theresa_May holds a press conference following EU Council https:t.co irtqNcSv— UK Prime MinisterDecember , She added: “I never said it was going to be easy.“Negotiations like this are always tough. There are always dficult times and as you get closer to the very end, that can get even more dficult because you are sorting out the last details of something.”Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s plan was “dead in the water” after she “utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes”, and reiterated Labour’s call for it to be put to a vote before Christmas.PM @Theresa_May has met leaders including @donaldtusk and @Xavier_Bettel at @EUCouncil today and discussed what is needed to get the Brexit deal over the line pic WMInAvAJkj— UK Prime MinisterDecember , Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington rejected that idea and defended Mrs May’s handling of the talks, telling Today: “Anybody who has heard Theresa May in debate, anybody who has heard her around the Cabinet table, knows there is a very clear plan.”He described the talks as “a welcome first step that was the removal of uncertainty” over the EU’s intentions, because it has shown it wants a “speedy UK trade deal” that would remove the need for the backstop in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"mays postbrexit trade deal suggestion dismissed by taoiseach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Scrapping the agency worker loophole is a victory for unions, but a right to request guaranteed working hours is no right at all - and plans to introduce new employment status laws risks letting gig employers off the hook.— TradesUnionCongressDecember , The Government said it was taking forward  of the  recommendations made in the Taylor Review.A statement said: “The reforms announced today reflect the views expressed by Matthew Taylor in his review into modern working practice that banning zero-hours contracts in their totality would negatively impact more people than it helped that the flexibility of ‘gig working’ is not incompatible with ensuring atypical workers have access to employment and social security protections.”TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Scrapping the agency worker loophole is a victory for union campaigning. It was an ‘undercutters’ charter’.“But these reforms as a whole won’t sht the balance of power in the gig economy.“Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour.“The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right all. Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said: “Work that’s flexible and fair is essential to the success of the UK’s labour market.“Focusing on issues like employee engagement, fairness and inclusion boost productivity as well as being the right thing to do.“Businesses support a strong floor of workplace rights, and it’s right that these laws keep pace with changes in the economy and society. They welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties.“However, legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future.”“These proposals do nothing to tackle the growing number of people on precarious zero-hours contracts, and with their botched Brexit deal threatening jobs and rights they’ll have to do a lot more than this to reassure workers.”Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “These measures may help make working le a little more bearable for some. But put simply, the Government could and should have gone much further.“Little will change to help the most exploited workers, and the most unscrupulous bosses are unlikely to start quaking in their boots.”Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said: “The Government’s plans are reluctant baby steps at best, and hardly give confidence that post-Brexit UK will be a country of decent jobs.“This is a time of historic low wages and of chronic job insecurity. We need proper, substantial action to combat this but what is on offer today falls well short of what this country needs to deliver work that pays.“People on zero-hour contracts and workers in the insecure economy need much more than a weak right to request a contract and more predictable hours.”"},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove and ed balls filmed dancing gangnam style at christmas party","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

However, we can now look forward to  with a new senior football team management in place, but with no guarantees of success, his report states.ldquoWe have to believe, though, that indeed the corner will be turned and as we look back to  years without inter-county senior success in football, there is surely a catalyst there for players to say they are going to make it happen.Mr McAteer points out that it will take a concerted effort from all involved in the game to get Down challenging for honours again.ldquoIt must come from within us all, players must want to make it happen in their efforts in training and on match days.ldquoAdministrators have to make sure that the environment is right for Down teams to be successful. If both of those two forces can come together then I do believe that we can be successful again.The county secretary believes that the project to develop a county training facility at Ballykinlar is another initiative to be positive about and he hopes that planning permission can be achieved in .ldquoThe hopes of many will take a further step forward early in  as we move to appoint a planning consultant and a design team for our centre at Ballykinlar, he says.ldquoThe past year has been spent being careful to ensure that all of the right steps were being taken hopefully to obtain full planning permission by the end of .While Mr McAteer praises written media within the county and thanks them for their excellent coverage of Gaelic games, he reserves some criticism for TV coverage.He says he is concerned by the coverage provided by the BBC and UTV.ldquoThere is an imbalance and this imbalance gives scant recognition of the fact that Gaelic Games are the best attended sporting events in the North of Ireland and also have now the greatest levels of participation by male and female participants.ldquoI do not wish this issue to become a political football whereby MLAs try to outscore each other on the back of an imbalance. I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games. We need at the very least, parity in terms of live and deferred TV coverage by BBC in particular and a better recognition of our games by UTV.Mr McAteer also pulls no punches when he covers some of the more controversial moments of .ldquoThere were good things happened in Down GAA in , occasions when we hung out our brightest colours and showed how can deliver to the highest standard.ldquoThere were other occasions when mediocrity was the norm and we became very good at mediocracy and then there was the ugly when we showed the country our poor and unacceptable side.ldquoYes, for Down GAA it was a year of mixed feelings and mixed emotions, pride and shame shared equal space in  in the world of Down GAA.ldquoThe eyes of the country and indeedwe take social media into account, the eyes of the world were focused upon us when images from one of our fixtures went viral and everyone was shocked by what they saw. The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

also be imposed on how long people can leave their vehicles in the Upper Square area in a bid to deter all-day parkers.While it is free to park in Castlewellan and there are currently no time

Theresa May used a Commons address on Monday to say a new national poll would do “irreparable damage” to the integrity of British politics.Strangford MP Mr Shannon echoed these remarks and warned that such a move would set a “dangerous precedent”.He told the News Letter: “The decision has been made. It would be a betrayal of the public to run another referendum, and would only serve to irreversibly damage trust in the political process.”Meanwhile, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has called for clarity about what concessions the prime minister is seeking from the EU.The party’s  MPs are adamantly opposed to the inclusion of any backstop in the withdrawal treaty because they believe it could separate the country from the rest of the UK.Mr Dodds said: “There is a need for clarity from the prime minister about exactly what she is asking for to deal with the key concerns about the legally binding indefinite nature of the backstop with no right for the United Kingdom to exit on its own terms.“The EU’s response to the summit was not surprising, but the prime minister must decide whether she will stand up to such tactics or once again accept a deal on Europe’s terms alone.”He made the call following a statement from the prime minister to Parliament.The North Belfast MP said: “Following the summit last week the European Council have talked about clarications and reassurances but ruled out renegotiating, contradicting or reopening the legal text.“They also even struck out text which stated the backstop didn’t represent a desirable outcome for the EU.”WEATHER WARNING: Rain and wind to batter NI with danger of flooding Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMother and two children die in house fireREVEALED: In pictures - every police station closed in Northern Ireland in last two decadesConcern for welfare of woman whose newborn baby found deadFunds raised for family of young crash victim Kai CorkumAll queers out daubed on N.I. flat front-door          ..

He had made arrangements with Antrim Borough Council to have their carriage kitted out with flowers and champagne, only for his plans to be put on ice due to the weather.Not one to hang around, he put together a back-up plan to ask Leanne for her hand in marriage at the Templeton Hotel in Templepatrick.Leanne, , said: “We’re five years together, we’ve one child at four and another on the way. Romance is sort of put to the side. I hadn’t a clue this was coming. Leannes four-year-old daughter Quinn was there to witness the romantic moment on Sunday“We had our gym party on Saturday night. The idea was to go up the big wheel first then go to the party and be able to tell everyone, celebrate with them and show them the ring.“Because of the weather warning, rather than wait, he went for plan B.”At the Templeton they were taken to a reserved table decorated with crystals where staff brought out drinks and a plate with ‘Marry Me ’ written on it in chocolate.Leanne said: “Then he got down on one knee and gave me the ring. It was really romantic. I was crying my eyes out. Then he told me what I could have won.”She added: “At least we got a second go at it. The big wheel will probably be the story we’ll tell peopleanyone asks how we got engaged.“Our daughter Quinn, four, was with us the second time. I’ve a priceless picture of her wee face when Niall put the ring on my finger.”WEATHER WARNING: Rain and wind to batter NI with danger of flooding Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMother and two children die in house fireREVEALED: In pictures - every police station closed in Northern Ireland in last two decadesConcern for welfare of woman whose newborn baby found deadFunds raised for family of young crash victim Kai CorkumWEATHER WARNING: Rain and wind to batter NI with danger of flooding          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Scrapping the agency worker loophole is a victory for unions, but a right to request guaranteed working hours is no right at all ndash and plans to introduce new employment status laws risks letting gig employers off the hook.mdash TradesUnionCongressDecember , The Government said it was taking forward  of the  recommendations made in the Taylor Review.A statement said: ldquoThe reforms announced today reflect the views expressed by Matthew Taylor in his review into modern working practice that banning zero-hours contracts in their totality would negatively impact more people than it helped that the flexibility of lsquogig workingrsquo is not incompatible with ensuring atypical workers have access to employment and social security protections.TUC general secretary Frances OrsquoGrady said: ldquoScrapping the agency worker loophole is a victory for union campaigning. It was an lsquoundercuttersrsquo charterrsquo.ldquoBut these reforms as a whole wonrsquot sht the balance of power in the gig economy.ldquoUnless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour.ldquoThe right to request guaranteed working hours is no right all. Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist.\"Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said: ldquoWork thatrsquos flexible and fair is essential to the success of the UKrsquos labour market.ldquoFocusing on issues like employee engagement, fairness and inclusion boost productivity as well as being the right thing to do.ldquoBusinesses support a strong floor of workplace rights, and itrsquos right that these laws keep pace with changes in the economy and society. They welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties.ldquoHowever, legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future.ldquoThese proposals do nothing to tackle the growing number of people on precarious zero-hours contracts, and with their botched Brexit deal threatening jobs and rights theyrsquoll have to do a lot more than this to reassure workers.Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: ldquoThese measures may help make working le a little more bearable for some. But put simply, the Government could and should have gone much further.ldquoLittle will change to help the most exploited workers, and the most unscrupulous bosses are unlikely to start quaking in their boots.Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said: ldquoThe Governmentrsquos plans are reluctant baby steps at best, and hardly give confidence that post-Brexit UK will be a country of decent jobs.ldquoThis is a time of historic low wages and of chronic job insecurity. We need proper, substantial action to combat this but what is on offer today falls well short of what this country needs to deliver work that pays.ldquoPeople on zero-hour contracts and workers in the insecure economy need much more than a weak right to request a contract and more predictable hours..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Labour: Gig economy workers trapped in Dickensian conditions article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The festive period can be a challenging time for some and that’s why Samaritans volunteers from the Craigavon branch are helping to keep the service running for those in need throughout the Christmas break, even on Christmas Day.Samaritans responded to more than , calls for help during December , by phone, email and text across Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Despite all the festivities, more than , of those calls for help and emotional support came in on Christmas Day.Samaritans is asking all of us to give the gt of a listening ear this Christmas, by encouraging friends and family going through a dficult time to open up and know that it’s OK to not be OK, even at Christmas. To make it easier, the charity has produced a set of vouchers to download from the Samaritans website, offering time to listen as a present.A pair of novelty socks won’t save a le but listening can make a huge dference.Emma Gale knows just how much dference it can make. She endured years of health problems and was unable to get a diagnosis. Emma said: “In the run up to Christmas  I was sent home from hospital. I felt ill, very lonely and a burden to everyone around me. I decided my family would be far better off without me and made plans to end my le. After driving to a quiet spot, I decided to call Samaritans for the first and only time in my le. I just needed someone to talk to, so I didn’t feel so alone.“The impact of that call was huge, it was a listening non-judgemental ear. From there my le completely turned around. The next day I went to a hospital appointment and I got a diagnosis for a rare genetic condition. I will never forget what that Samaritan did for me that Christmas, they gave me the biggest gt possible – the gt of le.”Emma’s le has changed so much since that call that now she’s become a Samaritans volunteer herself and will be doing a sht on the phones over Christmas for the first time this year, helping others who are struggling to cope.Samaritan volunteers from the Craigavon branch, will also be on the phones over Christmas and as one said: “Until you’ve sat in a Samaritans phone room and taken those calls over Christmas, you have no idea how tough it can be for a lot of people. “Some people assume Samaritans are just about suicide prevention, but there’s so much more to what we do, so many issues we deal with on a daily basis. Christmas feels like a condensed version of that, people’s problems seem to be turned up a notch at this time of year. For me, not to be answering the phones over Christmas just isn’t Christmas at all. The best present we can give someone is our time to listen.”Vivienne, Director Craigavon branch of Samaritans said: “If you’re feeling like it’s all too much, let someone know, don’t hide your feelings. You can always call Samaritans. Whether you’re on your own, or alone in a crowd, feeling lonely and isolated can be exacerbated at this time of year. If you are having a good time at Christmas, make time to listen to othersit’s not so great for them. Just having someone to listen can be a huge relief, and make things easier to bear.”You can download Samaritans’ Give The Gt of Listening vouchers for free at: http:www.samaritans.org christmas.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
