It was also reported that Diana picked out the jewel herself, while others claim that she chose it because it was the biggest and reminded her of her mother’s engagement ring.Princess Diana loved her engagement ring so much that she continued to wear it after her orce from Prince Charles in 1996 and it was made into a bracelet. She then started wearing an emerald-cut aquamarine ring in its place, the same one that Meghan Markle wore with her second wedding dress.          Princess Diana loved her engagement ring and continued to wear it after her orcePrincess Diana’s jewellery collectionGrant Mobley, a gemologist and Director at Pluczenik and one of the world’s leading diamantaires, said: ‘A beautiful ring that Princess Diana was seen wearing on her ring finger after her orce from Prince Charles was an emerald cut, aquamarine and diamond ring.He continued: ‘The Princess was very fond of a pearl and diamond bracelet featuring a large emerald cut aquamarine that she was given in her early years as a princess and, after her orce, she commissioned this matching ring to be made.‘Diana’s taste in jewellery was impeccable and the fact that she commissioned this ring to be made is a clear testament to her taste.           Meghan Markle seen here wearing Princess Diana\u0027s aquamarine ring to her wedding reception\u0027She always chose diamond jewellery that was meaningful to her - she was very intentional with her jewellery choices and made sure they were the best representation of those meaningful moments,’ he said, as reported in The Express.The aquamarine ring is thought to be around £75,000 because of the size, colour and quality of the centre diamond and a diamond from one of her rings was also used to make Meghan Markle’s engagement ring.Meghan Markle’s engagement ringDespite including a stone from Botswana and two diamonds from Princess Diana’s personal collection, Meghan Markle’s engagement ring was compared to one available from Argos for just £33.

Meghan also paid tribute to her late mother-in-law on her wedding day and wore Diana’s engagement ring to her wedding reception.          Meghan Markle\u0027s ring includes a stone from Botswana and two from Princess Diana’s collectionKate Middleton’s engagement ringWhen Diana passed away in 1997, Prince William and Prince Harry inherited her jewellery collection, which included her engagement ring, according to Good Housekeeping. The late Princess wrote: ‘I would like you to allocate all my jewellery to the share to be held by my sons, so that their wives may, in due course, have it or use it.

Seeing\u0026nbspthe young woman on a Vespa, you can hear the purr of the scooter and\u0026nbspthe gentle flap of the rider’s white skirt in the sea breeze, smell\u0026nbspthe perfumed and bronzed skin of the hopeful teenage lovers, taste the\u0026nbspgelato and hear the beach\u0026nbspjukebox.“Everyone loves Italy, the beach,\u0026nbspthe sea, the joie de vivre,” says\u0026nbspNori,\u0026nbspspeaking on the telephone. “I was there taking photos at a wonderful time, the 80s and 90s. There was no internet, no mobile phones and photography was still mythical.“These photos are not reportage – there is a certain staging, an ambience of dreams. I’m telling a story of myself, a Frenchman of Italian origins who went back to the beach he used to go to with his parents and seeks what he loved from that time. This is not the Italy of tourists, it’s not the Italy of monuments or museums. I wanted to show a side of Italy you don’t see very often.”Nori’s love affair with Italy started\u0026nbspearly. “Every summer in the\u0026nbsp1960s, we would load our luggage into my father’s blue Simca\u0026nbspElysée and drive to the Italian Adriatic beaches and sometimes the Mediterranean ones,” he writes in the book’s introduction. “We left\u0026nbspToulouse early in the morning\u0026nbspin\u0026nbsporder to arrive in the evening before sunset for our first\u0026nbspswim. My parents preferred the seaside resorts next to Rimini or Riccione, where prices were still\u0026nbspaffordable. My mother said the\u0026nbspsea there was bluer than anywhere else.”The way of life made a lasting impression on him. “The dolce far niente (“sweet doing-nothing”), sand, sea, sky, the pretty girls in bathing suits, skin’s sensuality offered to the sun, large tables bringing families together, bodies in\u0026nbspall shapes and forms and the Vespas always present in the set. I’m sure I became a photographer so that I could prolong this adolescence with impunity.”Nori began his career in the early 1970s in Paris with small jobs from advertising agencies\u0026nbspand magazines. But he kept being drawn back to Italy, and he and his friend Luigi Ghirri, the Italian artist and photographer whose Kodachrome images inspired Nori’s work, travelled the Italian coastal roads in a battered old Volkswagen.For the next four decades, Nori photographed Italian summers in the venues and bathing resorts of Rimini, Capri, Amalfi, Catania, Rapallo and Portofino. A first book of around 60 photographs, L’Été Dernier, was published in 1983. A second book, Un Été Italien, followed\u0026nbspin 2001 and sold out within\u0026nbspa few months.Italian Holidays contains “remastered and modernised” photographs from the 2001 book along with some new, previously unseen images. “My editor found one of the previous books in a store and thought the photographs would\u0026nbspinterest a new audience of young people,” says Nori. “These images are in a way eternal. This is like remastering a music album.”Most of these photographs, taken in the 1980s, are in Nori’s preferred black and white, to conjure up the Italian neorealism of the 60s and 70s. At the time, he would switch between his plastic autofocus Canon and a Single-8 film camera. “It’s about the approach, it’s about the aesthetic – framing the moment like it’s in a film,” he told i-D magazine in 2015. “In a way, I was making movies by way of still photographs.”While often deeply personal, Nori’s photos are a world away from today’s selfies, an obsession about which he is scathing. “Digital has swept away the mystery of the exposed yet undeveloped image,” he says. “Cellphones and hybrid devices \u0026nbsphave trivialised and broken the spell of the photographic process. It has become difficult to simply take a picture in the streets, on the move mistrust is now present everywhere\u0026nbspbecause of social networks. As soon as they are taken, these images move anarchically along on the internet. People prefer to avoid a photographer yet take multiple selfies, a phone with a camera at the end of an articulated arm whose\u0026nbspwide-angle lens disfigures their portrait.”“Looking back and observing my\u0026nbspItalian adventure,” he writes in the new book, “I am aware of having photographed a privileged territory at a time that was particularly happy and carefree.

Also, it is a colour that suffers from social stigma and cliches, so it’s fun to work with that and go against the grain of the prejudice.” Pancrazi now lives in Oxford, and his photographic series began with a desire to revisit the Mediterranean city where he grew up. “It started as an aestheticisation of my home town and the memories I had there,” he explains. “Living abroad, in a fairly different climate, prompted me to find the reality that was hidden beyond those ethereal memories.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4a443eebdac317b303d4f03e028dbefa403fc4c/226_538_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e91273f830e4daaa3e6b160d9b8b47d7","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The death of Aretha Franklin, the bridge collapse in Genoa and a scrambling turtle – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bf4a1e17a1cfe385e9064f1a2f050c3b0428759/0_654_1392_834/master/1392.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2686df36f9da32f00376ac10e360b09e","title":"patrick gale interview","story":"Patrick Gale is the author of 19 novels, including Rough Music, Notes From an Exhibition and the Costa-nominated A Place Called Winter. He wrote the acclaimed TV drama Man in an Orange Shirt, the centrepiece of the BBC’s 2017 Gay Britannia season. A keen cellist and gardener, he lives on a farm in the far west of Cornwall. Take Nothing With You is his new novel about boyhood, coming of age and the power of music.You often base your novels on your life and family. How autobiographical is Take Nothing With You?Like the lead character, Eustace, I learned the cello when I was young and went on these amazing residential music courses in Scotland, which were quite a rite of passage. The other thing lifted from life is Eustace’s mother having a terrible car crash. When I was 10 my mother crashed her old Morris Traveller, which didn’t have headrests, so she had terrible whiplash and a brain stem injury. She should have died and it was testimony to her amazing resilience that she survived. But she underwent a complete personality change. She used to be very witty, chatty and talkative. It was as if a different person came back from the hospital. She became so Christian it really took over her life, which profoundly affected the whole family.You mentioned the cello. How important is music in your life?Hugely. Music has been almost like a second career for me, both as a cellist and an administrator, running things like the St Endellion Summer Festival and the Penzance Orchestral Society, where I am secretary. I am passionate about how music transforms people. For children, I think it is so depressing that it is not an absolutely obligatory part of the national curriculum. Think of all that poetry, all those folk songs that nobody is learning any more. I feel it is a national tragedy.Writing Man in an Orange Shirt for TV was new territory for you. What did you take away from the experience?The thing I really enjoyed – and am still enjoying as I’m doing more TV writing – is the collaborative aspect, which is enormous fun. When you write a novel, it’s very lonely and you have no idea what anyone is going to think of what you’re writing, whereas when you write a script you have feedback at every stage – instant reassurance or not as the case may be.If you weren’t a writer, what do you think you would be doing with your life?I would probably be a psychotherapist. My abiding fascination, the thing that really sparked my interest in writing novels, is with what goes on under the human bonnet. I was never a scientist, so I could never have been a medical doctor, but I do think that if I have any gifts at all outside of writing I am quite good at getting people to talk about themselves, which I love to do. Everyone is really quite strange once you delve into their minds. There’s no such thing as normal.Are there any literary genres you particularly enjoy?I love science fiction, which was very much one of my ways into reading as a boy. My totemic childhood books were The Weirdstone of Brisingamen by Alan Garner and the Earthsea books by Ursula Le Guin. I also loved Le Guin’s adult science fiction books when I was older, not least because she plays very subversive games with gender.I’m told you like reading books about nuns...It’s true, I adore them. The book I would love to adapt for the BBC is The Corner That Held Them by Sylvia Townsend Warner. It’s a very subversive novel about a Fenland nunnery during the years of the Black Death, which sounds like not a barrel of laughs but is very, very funny and haunting and strange like all her novels. The reason I love books about nuns is that the enclosed world of the convent is such a brilliant metaphor. Nun books are as much about politics and power as they are about spirituality. Very slightly kinky, I know, but there it is.How do you organise your books?I am ruthless. They are organised by type so fiction, nonfiction and poetry are separated out, short stories are separated out from novels and they are all alphabetised, as is my spice rack. Do you have a favourite literary hero and heroine?I’m so boring – they are both from Jane Austen. Mansfield Park is probably my favourite – I cycle back to that a lot for the structure – but the novel that gets me every time is Persuasion. Anne Eliot is the most perfect heroine because she has that deep, deep tumultuous inner life, most of which she is too polite to show and that’s what is so beguiling. Captain Wentworth is completely wonderful too and I think it comes down to me hero-worshipping people who don’t give much away.What kind of a reader were you when you were young?Voracious. I was a Puffin Club member and obediently did just what the marketing department wanted. I probably spent my pocket money on a Puffin Club book every week. I also benefited hugely from being not only the child of bookish parents, living in a house where every room had stacks of books, but also the youngest of four children who all read as well. So I had the luxury of having almost a home library.Which book would you give to a young person like Eustace in Take Nothing With You, who is struggling to decide who he is?I would give them EM Forster’s Howards End, because it is one of those novels that really showed me, as a young reader, just what a novel was capable of, in that it contained multitudes. Not so much lots of characters, although it is richly peopled, more that it covers so much ground emotionally and psychologically that it erupts in your head and keeps on erupting long after you’ve read it.What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?There is always somewhere on my shelvesa book about how to improve your Italian or German– evidence of my constant battle to learn other languages. That’s been a lifelong thing with me. I am a pretty fluent French speaker but I yearn to speak more languages.What do you plan to read next?I want to read Neil Ansell’s memoir, The Last Wilderness. He’s a wonderful nature writer who is going deaf. Like all musicians, I have a complete horror of losing my hearing but I think in his case it must be even worse because it means he can’t hear birdsong. This book is very much about coming to terms with that and about his lifelong love of solitude. I think as a society we are a bit cowardly about our own company. I don’t know about you but I love my own company, I think it is a great luxury.What do you most like doing when alone, apart from gardening?I love to bake. I make our own sourdough bread and I love to bake and to read about baking. It’s something that comes from when my mother was in hospital when I was a child. I started cooking a lot then and, like a lot of children, baking was the first thing I felt confident about having a go at rather than trying to cook a full meal. I’m very interested in the link between sugar and power. I think in a lot of families the person who bakes the cakes wields a lot of influence. They are just bribes, basically: you’re making people love you by giving them cake.• Take Nothing With You by Patrick Gale is published by Tinder Press (£18.99).

Houses and streets are potent when it comes to our childhood memories, but I can think of reasons why this is especially true of Bristol’s. Much of the city is hilly, so that it’s showy: wherever you look its streets are laid out on display – layered like a tiered wedding cake above the wooded gorge of the river Avon, or festooned around steep hillsides in Totterdown above Temple Meads. And we learned how the city’s buildings were its history, in school trips to those parts of the medieval centre that had survived wartime air raids and the assault of postwar development – conservationists were fighting a defensive action, street by street. The city was full of “bombsites”: the word in our childish usage was casual, interchangeable with playgrounds. Grown over with grass and purple buddleias, the bombsites were more peaceful than screaming swings and seesaws.In the 1960s the terraces of Clifton and Hotwells, built in the 18th century, were only just beginning to be desirable. Most hadn’t been done up and made-over, so they seemed to have ancientness clinging to them, the deep past perhaps not much of the 18th-century past, which was too far away, but certainly something dark and decayed and Dickensian. My parents bought, on a schoolteacher’s salary, a skinny tall Georgian house in Kingsdown Parade: four storeys plus a basement, two rooms on each floor. It came with two sitting tenants: an old lady in the basement and Old Tom with a cleft palate, who worked for the Salvation Army, in our front room. Below the basement there was a real windowless cellar, which seemed carved out of the rock: when I heard later that Jung had modelled the psyche as a house, with ancestors in the basement and culture in the attic, I seemed to recognise the place. We had an attic, with exhilarating views over the city, which we let to an art student he absconded leaving enormous abstract paintings, grey and pink, in lieu of rent – we lived with these for years afterwards. My dad kept his home-made wine in our cellar, brewed from a kit. And I was excited, after a trip to Wookey Hole caves, to discover stalactites growing from its ceiling.The past seemed to be layered beneath the present and visibly showing through it: houses these days can seem dimensionless by comparison, because they’re made over and updated so often. The house next door to us in Kingsdown Parade was all bedsits, with torn lace curtains hanging behind broken dirty windows: an old woman who lived in there wore a long black dress like a Victorian. My grandparents’ house in Ashley Down, where we visited each week for Sunday dinner, was still furnished as it had been when they moved in in the 1920s – so that I was intimate with the gravy-brown gloom of that era, its paintings hanging in chains from the picture rail. Meanwhile my mother was transforming our own house in the bright light of contemporary Scandinavia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5ae977ce42ac2f904df163c9453a2cf4e8bb0d3/0_137_3672_2204/master/3672.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0e6cfe32604d62a085d21814d16d041","title":"obamas letters to fellow americans in pictures","story":"In 2009, the new US president set a rule that he’d read 10 letters a day from members of the public.

He reveals what they meant to himIt was October 2016. Hurricane Matthew had just rolled out to sea, Samsung phones were catching fire, Hillary Clinton was up by double digits in the national polls and the unthinkable was still unthinkable. Shailagh Murray had spent two terms in the White House helping to lead the administration’s communications strategy and it appeared to have taken its toll. With Obama just a few months away from leaving office, journalists wanted exit interviews they wanted to be first, biggest, loudest. She was sick of the egos, the same old questions.The letters, she said, served as a respite from all that, and she offered to show some to me. She chose a navy blue binder, pulled it off the shelf, and opened it, fanning through page after page of letters, some handwritten in cursive on personal letterheads, others block printed on notebook paper and decorated with stickers there were business letters, emails, faxes and random photographs of families, soldiers and pets. “You know, it’s this dialogue he’s been having with the country that people aren’t even aware of,” she said, referring to Obama’s eight-year habit of cor­responding with the American public. “Collectively, you get this kind of American tableau.”Obama had committed to reading 10 letters a day when he first took office, becoming the first president to put such a deliberate focus on constituent correspon­dence. Late each afternoon, around five o’clock, a selection would be sent up from the post room to the Oval Office. The “10 LADs”, as they came to be known – for “10 letters a day” – would circulate among senior staff and the stack would be added to the back of the briefing book the president took with him to the resi­dence each night. He answered some by hand and wrote notes on others for the writing team to answer, and on some he scribbled “save”.Starting in 2010, all physical mail was scanned and preserved. From 2011, every word of every email fac­tored into the creation of a daily word cloud, dis­tri­buted around the White House so policy makers and staff members alike could get a glimpse of the issues and ideas constituents had on their minds.In 2009, Natoma Canfield, a cancer survivor from Medina, Ohio, wrote in, detailing her staggering health insurance premiums in a letter Obama framed and had hung in a corridor between his private study and the Oval Office: “I need your health reform bill to help me!!! I simply can no longer afford to pay for my health care costs!!” It stood in for the tens of thousands of similar letters he got on the healthcare issue alone. They saw spikes in volume after major events such as the mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, and Charleston, South Carolina the Paris terrorist attacks the government shutdown Benghazi. You could see these spikes in the word clouds. “Jobs” might grow for a time, or “Syria”, or “Trayvon”, or a cluster such as “family-children-fear” or “work-loans-student” or “Isis-money-war” surrounding a giant “help” – the most common word of all.“You should go to the mailroom if you want the full effect,” she said. “Just sit there and read. You’ll see what I’m talking about.”“We will begin with a tour,” said Fiona Reeves on welcoming me at the White House security gate. In emails she had said I would have to agree to certain terms before I would be allowed into the post room. These mostly had to do with privacy concerns – I couldn’t disclose the contents of any letter I read unless it was cleared with its author – but the forti­tude with which she announced the rules made the larger point: Reeves cared deeply about people who wrote letters to the president.“Why don’t you sit down and read?” she said. Ten interns were crowded around two long tables, but there was an extra seat.A girl doesn’t want her mum to be deported, and can the president please help? A guy finally admits to his wife that he’s gay, and now he would like to tell the president. A car dealer writes to say his bank is shut­ting him down, and thanks for nothing, Mr President. A vet who can’t stop seeing what he saw in Iraq writes a barely intelligible rant that makes his point all the more intelligible: “Help.” An inmate admits to selling crack, but he wants the president to know he is not a lost cause: “I have dreams Mr President, big dreams.” A man can’t find a job. A woman can’t find a job. A teacher with advanced certification can’t find a damn job. A lesbian couple just got married thank you, Mr President. A man sends his medical bills a woman sends her student loan statements a child sends her drawing of a cat a mother sends her teen­ager’s report card – straight As, isn’t that awesome, Mr President?This pile, that pile, another pile over there pull from the middle if you want. The narrative was sloppy and urgent, America talking all at once. No filter. The hand­writing, the ink, the choice of letter­head – every letter was a real object from a real person, and now you were holding it, and so now you were responsible for it.In total, the Office of Presidential Correspondence required the orchestration of 50 staff members, 36 interns and a rotating roster of 300 volunteers to keep up with about 10,000 letters and mes­sages every day. As the director of the entire operation, Reeves was the one who kept it all humming along.¶Reeves and I met again in March 2018. It was a windy day, and we were about to head over to meet with Obama in the post-presidency office he maintains in Washington. I had spent months tracking down the people who had written letters, following up on their stories, finding out how hearing from the president had changed their lives.Since leaving the White House Reeves had become a mother. She told me about a meeting she’d had, before she left, with the White House staff secre­tary for President-elect Donald Trump. He asked about the post room, how it worked, and Reeves told him about the transition materials, the binders, and she did her best to summarise. “Ten letters a day,” she said, as if that would simply be the normal order of business. The president would be expected to read his mail and answer it. The meeting was maybe 20 minutes. The staff secretary said some­one would be getting back to her for more information. No one did.Obama had been largely absent from public life since he left office, working on his foundation and his book, offering no comment on the cascading tumult that characterised the US’s new political landscape. At that point, he had done just three interviews: one about his early days as a community organiser, another that brought David Letterman out of retire­ment, and a third with Prince Harry. And now he would do one more: a conversation about the post room.His suite was bright, airy and colourful. Large images of the Pacific Ocean adorned the waiting area, along with a set of Muhammad Ali’s boxing gloves that had been on display in the Oval Office dining room. Head­­ing down the wide centre hall toward Obama’s office brought you stead­ily closer to a photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. The image was of King’s back as he stood before a crowd – the point of view of the speaker, not the listener.Many of the staffers, about 12 in all, had worked for Obama in the White House, and most of them knew Reeves people stepped out of their offices to greet her. Obama app­eared just like the rest of them, smiling widely. You don’t realise just how lanky he is until you see him in person, a long, flat physique he looked fit, even youthful, his hair cut short so that all the grey he’d famously acquired during his presi­dency was less pronounced. He walked up to Reeves with his arms outstretched and asked about her family, and she sheepishly stepped in for a hug.“I’m great. She’s great. We’re just great … ”“Well, we’ve got babies popping out,” Obama said. “It’s the best thing. I’ve got all these staff who started with me when they were like 20. And now suddenly it’s like they’ve got kids everywhere. It’s sweet. And a bunch of them, you know, a number of them met on the campaign or at the White House. But nobody yet has named a child Barack.”“A lot of letter writers did,” Reeves offered, perhaps too quietly for him to hear.“I’m a little frustrated about that,” Obama continued with a laugh. “I’m like, ‘Come on, people!’”We followed him into his office. He offered us a seat on the couch, and he sank into the chair at the end. He was in jeans and a light blue shirt unbuttoned at the top. He put his feet up, crossed his legs at the ankles. Pete Souza’s book of photographs was on the coffee table family pictures were everywhere, on end tables, on the walls and Obama’s expansive desk on the other side of the room was covered in paper and books. He mentioned the book he’s been working on, said it was difficult. “Writing is just so hard. Painful. It’s – everybody thinks it’s, you know. But it’s work. It’s like having homework all the time. Yeah, it’s hard.“I should mention to you, by the way, Fiona,” he said, as we were getting settled, “we’re still getting like 250,000 letters a year. It’s a lot.”I noticed that over by his desk, on a wall, he had hung the framed letter from Natoma Canfield Obama had said she reminded him of his mum, who died at 52 of a similar cancer. The letter had stood as a reminder to him of his commitment to healthcare reform.“The only instruction I gave was that I wanted every packet to be representative,” he continued. “And understanding that it wouldn’t be perfect. It didn’t mean that, you know, out of every 10 letters, there had to be two positive and two negative and three neutral and one funny. It wasn’t formulaic like that. But that was the one thing I insisted on – that this is not useful to me if all I’m getting are, you know, ‘happy birthday’ wishes. And I think they did a won­derful job of channelling the American people in that way.”“It wasn’t just me,” Reeves said. “It was this big group. And folks in the office came from different backgrounds. We had our volunteer workforce. And there were some old people in the mix, too. So we had a lot of people putting stuff forward for you, a lot of people interpreting what ‘representative’ meant.”“I will say this does also have to do with a culture that we tried to develop early on in the campaign,” Obama said. “Which was putting a lot of confidence in a bunch of young people to fairly, meaningfully, and passionately reflect the people they were inter­act­ing with. Whether that was on a campaign or in the office.”I asked if he had any sense of the power of his response to the people who wrote to him. “I think I understood that if somebody writes a letter and they get any kind of response, that there’s a sense of ... being heard,” he said. “And so often, espe­ci­ally back in 2009, 2010, 2011, a lot of people were going through a lot of hardship. And a lot of them felt alone in that hardship. They were losing their homes, or they’re dealing with somebody at the bank and the bank say­ing: ‘There’s nothing we can do. You’re going to lose your house.’ Or they’ve got a pink slip, and they’ve lost their job, and they’re going to interview after interview after interview. Over time, I think it’s easy for folks to feel a little invisible, as if nobody’s paying attention. And so I did, I think, understand that if I could at least let them know that I saw them and I heard them, maybe they’d feel a little bit less lonely in those struggles.“Certainly what I learned during the presidency was that the office of the president itself carries enormous weight,” Obama went on. “And, sadly, probably where I learned that best was in moments of tragedy where you’d visit with grieving families. Sometimes they were in places where – I think it’s fair to say – I didn’t get a whole lot of votes. You know, after a tornado or a flood or a shooting. And what was clear was that my presence there signified to those families that they were important. Their loved ones were important. The grief they were feeling was important. That it had been seen and acknowledged.”“That notion of being heard,” I said. “It seemed to be embedded throughout all of this.”“I still believe it,” he said. “I think this whole letter-writing process and its importance reflected a more fundamental vision of what we were trying to do in the campaign and what I was trying to do with the presi­dency and my political philosophy. The foun­dational theory, it probably connects to my early days organising. Just going around and listening to people. Asking them about their lives, and what was import­ant to them. And how did they come to believe what they believe? And what are they trying to pass on to their children?”He looked straight ahead, at a spot somewhere near his feet propped up on the coffee table.“I learned in that process that if you listen hard enough, everybody’s got a sacred story,” he said. “An organising story, of who they are and what their place in the world is. And they’re willing to share it with you if they feel as if you actually care about it. And that ends up being the glue around which relation­ships are formed, and trust is formed, and commu­nities are formed. And ultimately – my theory was, at least – that’s the glue around which democracies work.”“Listening,” I said.“Yeah,” he said. “I don’t want to suggest that I would have necessarily described it in a sort of a straight line from when I started running. But I do think that that was pretty embedded in our campaign philosophy. I think that’s how we won Iowa, by having a bunch of young kids form those relationships because they were listening to people. It wasn’t us selling a policy mani­festo, and it wasn’t even because we were selling me. It was because some young person in a town they’d never been to went around and talked to people, and listened to them, and saw them. And created the kinds of bonds that made people want to then try to work together.”He was talking about Reeves and all the people like her who knocked on doors.“It’s the power of empathy not as an end-all, be-all,” he said. “Because even after you’ve listened to some­body or seen them, they still have a concrete problem. They’ve lost their house. They’ve lost their job. They disagree with you on abortion. They think that you’re pulling troops out of Afghanistan too soon and, you know, potentially betraying the sacrifices that have been made by the fallen. There are all these concrete issues that are real. And there are real conflicts and real choices.“But what this form of story sharing and empathy and listening does is it creates the conditions around which we can then have a meaningful conversation and sort through our differences and our challenges, and arrive at better decisions because we’ve been able to hear everybody. Everybody feels heard so that even if a decision’s made that they don’t completely agree with, then at least they feel like: ‘OK, I was part of this. This wasn’t just dumped on me.’“It goes both ways, right?” Obama said. “I want to emphasise the degree to which this was important and useful to me doing my job.“There was a sizable percentage of the letters where, if they were critical, I’d read them and say: ‘Well, that’s not fair. I don’t think that’s true. They obviously don’t know this.’ But there were times where somebody would write a letter, and I’d say: ‘I can see their point.’ And I’d circle it, and I’d write it on the margins: ‘Is this true?’ or ‘Can you explain why this is?’ or ‘Why don’t we fix this?’”The last time we had talked he was still in the White House and we’d discussed some of the mail he got in the wake of the 2016 election. “There was a lot of anxiety and sadness I had to respond to,” he said then. “I remember one that said: ‘Pack up your bags because, thank goodness, we’re about to undo everything you’ve done it couldn’t have come a moment too soon,’ some­thing along those lines. I don’t think I responded to that one ... ”I had asked him how he might advise President-elect Trump on what to do with the mail.He had laughed. I think it was more out of awk­war­d­ness than because of any sort of image the question may have conjured.“But, um, it, ah,” he said about the idea of Trump reading the mail. “You know what, this is a great habit. I think it worked for me because it wasn’t something I did for anyone else. I did it because, as you said, it sustained me. So maybe it will sustain others in the future. OK?”OK. But I never used the word “sustained”. I remember wondering how that word had popped up.“I can tick off the bills and the policies and the accomplishments. But I tell you one of the things I’m proud of about having been in this office is that I don’t feel like I’ve ... lost myself.” Like everything else, that thought came out slowly. “I feel as if – even if my skin is thicker from, you know, public criticism, and I’m wiser about the workings of government, I haven’t become ... cynical, and I haven’t become callous, and I would like to think that these letters have something to do with that.”The letters as sustenance came up again during our second meeting. “I will say, selfishly, that the number of people who would write letters acknow­ledging the meaningful difference that a policy had made in their lives – making it real as opposed to abstract – was sustaining.We talked about another letter writer, Marjorie, who wrote about trying to expel the racism she believed was lodged like poison in her heart. She had discovered it and wanted to get rid of it.“She was writing to tell you that she was listening to you.”“She went for it. She wanted to tell you that.”“It makes me proud,” he said. “My grandmother, who loved me more than anyone, had an initial reaction like Marg to young black men approaching.”Obama had told the story about his grandmother back in the earliest days of the presidential cam­paign, in a speech during the 2008 primaries against Hillary Clinton. He had been criticised for his can­dour about a topic as sensitive as unconscious bias. In a radio inter­view later, he tried to explain what he had meant, which only made it more contro­versial. “The point I was making,” he said to the host, “was not that Grand­mother harbours any racial animo­s­ity. She doesn’t. But she is a typical white person, who, if she sees somebody on the street that she doesn’t know, you know, there’s a reac­tion that’s been bred in our experi­ences that doesn’t go away and that sometimes comes out in the wrong way, and that’s just the nature of race in our society.”“Typical white person.” You’re not supposed to say stuff like that, especially not as the first black candi­date ever to run for the office as a major party’s candidate. The Clinton campaign pounced. Obama was clearly new at this game.Now all that listening he’d been talking about – eight years of it – was just history. All those letters he’d rece­ived during his presidency had been shipped off to the National Archives. They’ll live on, artefacts for a mus­eum exhibit someday. Here are the voices of America, from 2009 to 2017. But the letters offer more. They remind you that government can work and that people committed to public service really do exist. We had this, which means we can have it again.“And, you know, right now,” Obama said, “a lot of people who have worked with me in the past or supported me or voted for me, you know, can get discouraged by the news day to day. And that’s understandable. I always have to be careful in not sounding as if I am Pollyannaish about the future.”The future. America was not, as of late, ageing gracefully. Did he feel responsible?“A better future is earned,” he said. “It’s hard work. And democracy in a country this big, with such a erse population, is especially hard. And compli­cated. And there are times in our history where we’ve had bad, ugly stretches. And so it’s important not to ever forget and to recognise that the ideals and the best version of America isn’t preordained.“But I do think that when you hear someone like Marjorie, at her age, just take a leap of faith like that, then you can’t help but feel as if it is worth the effort.“If we duplicate enough of those moments, enough of those interactions, enough of those shared stories, over time we get better at this thing called democracy. And that is something that all of us have the capacity to do. That’s not the job of the president. That’s not the job of a bunch of professional policy makers. It’s the job of citizens.”• This is an edited extract from To Obama: With Love, Joy, Hate and Despair by Jeanne Marie Laskas, published by Bloomsbury on 18 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e33bf9ea2d76d4541a6d22a48259e55f1b233bd/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=268013864249897ffe2feafdfe5ef278","title":"brexit looming energy sector builds new links europe","story":"While Westminster attempts to deliver Brexit within months, the UK’s energy system is set to become dramatically more dependent on the EU just as Britain leaves.As the UK’s Brexit white paper said in understated fashion: “There has been a trend towards greater interconnectivity that has brought mutual benefits to trading partners.”Leading the charge is National Grid, which is behind three of the 11 new proposed cables.Jon Butterworth, who heads the group’s interconnectors business, said: “From our perspective, and from the perspective of the general public, there’s not a lot of downsides to interconnectors.”The company argues the links are good for consumers because lower wholesale prices on the continent will translate to cheaper energy bills in the UK. Households will save £9.01 a year once the 13.9GW of new capacity has come online, it calculates.That may not be much off the £1,138 average annual bill, but it would almost offset the cost of Hinkley Point C, the nuclear power station that will add at least £10 to bills.National Grid says interconnectors are vital to make electricity networks more flexible, a priority as more wind and solar power comes online.Interconnectors have obvious appeal as a source of growth for the company, which is mulling job cuts in response to regulator Ofgem proposing tougher price controls on its core business, the UK’s national electricity network.Brexit poses one obvious risk, with the prospect of trading energy across borders becoming harder. The Brexit white paper stressed the need for efficient trade across interconnectors.But National Grid and its European counterparts, who develop the cables through joint ventures, believe the fundamentals remain unchanged.He rejected criticism that the cables threatened energy security and would not be subject to the UK’s carbon tax, charges usually levelled at interconnectors by firms that wanted to build big gas power stations in Britain.Industry experts broadly agree that greater interconnection is a good thing in a world with more renewables, but there is no consensus on how much.“The question is: what is the optimal level of interconnection? There is a hole in thinking,” said Peter Atherton, analyst at Cornwall Insight. He believes the links have played an important role in the UK’s energy system.Cheaper power from Europe sounds like good news for households hit by tariff rises blamed on rising wholesale costs. But if wholesale prices went too low it could hurt the economics of UK-based power stations. “A low wholesale price is not necessarily a good thing,” said Atherton. “We don’t accept dumping of other things.”National Grid’s dual role as builder of interconnectors and manager of balancing electricity supplies has also raised questions about its vested\u0026nbspinterests. “I wouldn’t say there is conflict of interest, but there is potential,” said Atherton.Other companies are building cables through the Channel tunnel, and planning to connect to electricity supplies as far away as Germany.National Grid’s link to Belgium is its first to come online, in early 2019. It will be followed by a second connection to France in 2020, and then the world’s longest subsea interconnector to Norway.The company is not ruling out more radical ideas, including interconnectors for a Dutch-backed island in the North Sea surrounded by windfarms. Butterworth said: “It’s just something we need to take a good, hard look at. It’s not crazy. You’ve got to sometimes push the boundary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1372a9412e98444c29323fba275a13e2a58b88c7/0_0_5400_3587/master/5400.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acbc76aa34a550daeac5f828db10e6b7 660w","title":"how to cope with disappointing a level results exams","story":"Pictures of elated teenagers jumping with joy and stories about high-achieving students gaining places at Oxbridge were all over the news last week. But not everyone has been celebrating A-level success and the publication of the results of new, tougher GCSEs on Thursday will undoubtedly see more pupils unhappy with their grades.For some of the 129,700 A-level students who last Thursday woke to find they did not have a place at university because they did not achieve the grades needed, the future may have looked bleak – or at least a bit cloudy. But you never know where you may find a silver lining. We asked five people with experience of exam disappointment for their strategies and coping mechanisms.“At school you have such myopic focus, and you have to specialise so early,” says Fred Weller, 22. “I hadn’t thought about an alternative plan if I didn’t achieve the A-level grades I needed to study medicine.“Comparing myself to my peers only made it worse. I felt so alone that day. I remember apologising to my mum for letting her down, and her turning round and telling me I was being an idiot. But in my mind, I was an abject failure.”His mother Sarah, 55, says: “I remember Fred was gutted about his results but, personally, I wasn’t disappointed. My priority has always been his happiness. He had decided at 14 he wanted to study medicine, which is very young. At the back of my mind, I had always been concerned he was veering away from his natural interest in the humanities. In my opinion, you should study something that makes your heart sing.”She encouraged him to look for another course through clearing. “When he saw a classics course he could apply for, I reminded him about how much, as a small boy, he had enjoyed learning about the Greek and Roman myths. We stressed that, if he gave it a go but hated it, he could come home at Christmas and we would come up with another plan together.”“That really helped,” says Fred. “I felt massively supported.” He got in and “never looked back,” Sarah says. After winning an award for his high marks in his BA, he is now studying for an MA in classics.“My experience taught me why hard work is necessary but also that I should do what I want to do, rather than what I think I should be\u0026nbspdoing,” Fred says. “Now I look back and am proud of how I handled the situation. My results drove me to succeed.”“I opened my A-level grades and they were even lower than I’d thought they would be,” says Steven Bartlett, 25, co-founder of the Social Chain Group, a social media marketing company. He received B, C and D, lower than had been predicted.“I was disappointed. I knew I wouldn’t be able to go to Newcastle University as I’d planned. But I just reminded myself I was going to be successful regardless. I knew I was good at influencing other people and I’d already started my own business. I said to myself: you’ve messed up your grades, now you better hope they don’t matter as much as everyone says they do. I suspected they were lying, that I didn’t need an A* to succeed in life – and I was right.”The global company Bartlett founded now turns over tens of millions of pounds a year and he is a multimillionaire. “I grew up very poor,” he says. “My mum can’t read or write. She left school in Africa at the age of seven. She was very upset when she heard about my grades and later, when I dropped out of the university I got into through clearing, she stopped speaking to me.“Both times, I tried to rationalise why she felt that way. I knew it wasn’t because I was a failure or had hurt anyone. It was because she had a very narrow view of what success was. In her opinion, as long as I succeeded in education I would be OK. She loves me and was trying to protect me.” It all comes down to perspective. I think the only real danger of getting a bad grade is letting a bad grade get to you.”“Students should look at these results as just a stepping stone,” says Primrose Kitten, 35, a London secondary school teacher and vlogger who creates GCSE and A-level revision videos. “If you’ve got the results you need to move on to university, college or a job you want, in the end, your grades won’t matter. If you didn’t get what you need, you still have lots of other options. Maybe you’ll find something even better to study or do.“Try to put your current circumstances into perspective. Your results might feel like a big deal right now, but they are just letters and numbers. They are not representative of your character or worth. Don’t fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others who may have different resources. Your results do not dictate how successful you are going to be in the future.“From now on, you get to make your own choices about what you are going to do with the rest of your life. Whatever you do, don’t allow your grades to limit you. Take what you’ve got and do what you want. There are so many fantastic and exciting things out there waiting for you. The world is your oyster.”“Exam results can be a devastating, traumatic experience,” says psychologist Stephen Joseph, 54, author of Authentic: How to be Yourself and Why it Matters. “Your sense of yourself and your place in the world may come crashing down. But remember the education system has a very narrow interpretation of what skills matter. You may have skills and abilities, all yet to flourish, which have been untapped by examiners.“If you know yourself well enough, you may already be aware of the tension between you and the education system. You may have studied subjects which wouldn’t really have been your first choice and be on a path in life which isn’t really your own, when you hit a crunch point like exam results day. It’s actually an opportunity to redirect your life and follow your passions – but that can be very hard, because until that point, your life hasn’t been your own.“To own yourself, you must be able to stand your ground, to say: this is me, this is what I want, this is the direction I want to go in, and resist the pressures of other people. It won’t happen overnight. People will need to give you freedom to find your own path and strengths.“Let your goals be your own – the things you really want to pursue in life. Find out what is meaningful to you and which activities put you in a state of flow, where time just slips by. That should give you a clue about what you should be doing in your life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff54d0adaa39d0bcce773ffe74befe3cf8f9cd5a/652_277_4972_2984/master/4972.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4de61614e383333a47b4fc73e92d19d","title":"kingdom of the sapeurs inside congo fashion week","story":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s misfortunes have often eclipsed its good news, with ongoing armed conflicts and most recently an Ebola outbreak.

True, Henry Ford and John D Rockefeller made far larger fortunes, but most people couldn’t pick them out of a line up. Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken, however, enjoys a strange celebrity, even 40 years after his death. His face, with the distinctive goatee and browline glasses, is plastered across 22,000 KFC outlets around the world – including a branch called Sanders Cafe, a diner on Highway 25, just outside Corbin, Kentucky. It doesn’t look much, and is situated next to a rundown tanning salon (“new bulbs, new owner”) but for some this is a place of pilgrimage. In 1932, it became the Colonel’s first restaurant and remains open to this day.At lunchtime, customers are queueing to place their orders and eat in the original chestnut-panelled dining room. On the way to the restrooms, a few display cabinets feature one of Sanders’ trademark white suits and string ties, alongside old menus and memorabilia. At one table, Leslie Shriner, 52, a fifth-grade teacher from Florida, sits with Jeff Metcalf, 52, who grew up and lives in Corbin. “He’s taken me here on a date. I think he’s trying to impress me,” she laughs. She’s only half joking. She and Jeff have been going out for six months she’s paying him a visit and he wants to show her the sights. She hasn’t eaten a KFC meal since she was in high school. “I usually try to eat clean meats and organic vegetables and healthy food.” But he insisted they lunch at Kentucky’s most famous restaurant.Jeff explains: “For someone who grew up in Corbin, it’s a source of pride that KFC is now all over the world.” He travels quite a bit for work. “Wherever I go, even in China, when they find out I am from Kentucky they always ask if I knew Colonel Sanders. That is the first association they make.”The unofficial curator of the Sanders Cafe is Steve Dearing, 69, who has spent most of his career at KFC, having joined in 1969 to work alongside the Colonel, helping design the restaurants. “I have given tours to two groups from Japan, and I am not being facetious, it is almost a religious experience for them,” he tells me in his light Kentucky drawl. “They smell the walls. It is a truly deep emotional experience.”How did covering some chicken meat in seasoned flour and milk and then deep frying it become so popular? And can this boom survive not just huge competition in the dining-out market, but the increasing number of vegans and meat-eaters who want to adopt a more healthy diet? How long can a KFC Mighty Bucket For One meal, packing a gut-busting 1,275 calories, survive when politicians, particularly in the UK, talk about restricting fried-chicken shops in a bid to halt an obesity epidemic?In the UK, it’s possible that you might have missed the fried-chicken craze. But something strange happened in February this year, when KFC was involved in what appeared to be one of the biggest corporate cock-ups of all time: it ran out of chicken. In a bid to cut costs, the company had changed distributors to DHL, the German logistics company, and moved from three distribution centres to one. A mixture of the software not being tested properly, a failure to hire and train enough staff, and a crash on the M6, meant the new warehouse was unable to supply restaurants with fresh chicken. At one point, 646 of the UK’s 900 KFCs were forced to close for days on end.But while this was terrible for the company’s short-term sales, it revealed an unlikely wave of affection for the chain, and for fried chicken in general. Helped by a swift and irreverent mea culpa from the company (the adverts were headlined “FCK – we’re sorry”), people flooded social media to joke that KFC running out of chicken was worse than Trump or an early warning of the apocalypse. In London, the politan police issued a statement imploring people not to contact the emergency services.It’s also in London, chiefly, that chicken has gained a hip, urban following, as evidenced by YouTube’s Chicken Connoisseur, Elijah Quashie, whose shakily recorded reviews of takeaway outlets frequently gain more than 2m views (Quashie now has his own Channel 4 show, Peng Life). Meanwhile, a number of higher-end diners such as Chick ’n’ Sours and Shake Shack sell fried chicken to a mostly young crowd, alongside music and cocktails. “In the last few years, chicken – unless you are a vegan or a veggie – has become the go-to food for millennials,” says Paul Hemings, who with his wife opened Bird, a small chain of fried-chicken restaurants in London, four years ago. “Chicken is having a moment, not just in the US and the UK but around the world. Chicken is where it’s at.”And yet KFC has ridden this wave, opening new stores at the rate of one every seven hours. In the last two years, the chain has launched in Macedonia, Uzbekistan, Albania, Guyana, taking the number of KFC countries up to 131 – more than McDonald’s.To understand the rise of fried chicken, you must first understand the rise of chicken itself, an ascent that has been dramatic since 1948. This was when the final of the Chicken of Tomorrow contest was organised by the US Department of Agriculture, in an attempt to breed a bird that could – on an ounce-per-dollar basis – compete with pork and beef.Previously, chickens had been farmed primarily to lay eggs. Most people thought chicken meat neither tasty nor good value. The Chicken of Tomorrow contest encouraged farmers to cross breeds in an attempt to create, in the breathless words of one newspaper report at the time, “breast meat so thick you can carve it into steaks”. Breeds that had a propensity to overeat and thus grow quickly were favoured. The contest had a profound effect on the poultry industry – creating a bigger, cheaper, more profitable bird with larger breasts, and one that could be slaughtered after six weeks rather than 12. Nearly all birds we eat today, whether in America or Europe, are descendants of the winning Cornish-New Hampshire crossbreed.People fell in love with the taste of chicken. As the price of chicken tumbled compared with beef and pork, it became ever more popular, helped by the fact it is acceptable to many major religions.Britain, for instance, slaughtered a mere 1 million chickens in 1950. By 1965, this number had leapt to 150 million birds. The official figures for last year show we slaughtered more than 1 billion. In 2016, global production of poultry meat hit 119m tonnes, overtaking pork for the first time, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. Chicken is now the world’s No 1 meat.Harland Sanders’ cafe played a crucial role in all this. It sold various items, including ham, biscuits (a Kentucky speciality, similar to a savoury scone) and fried chicken. He, of course, did not invent the dish it had been a staple of southern cooking, especially for African Americans, for decades.But his was different, thanks to a “secret” blend of 11 herbs and spices and his method of cooking. “The Colonel perfected his recipe with the pressure cooker,” explains his former colleague Dearing, pointing to a bulky old appliance at the Sanders Cafe. “The pressure fryer not only makes it cook quicker, it pushes the moisture and flavour into the meat.”Fried chicken can only become fast food once it is fast. Where it once took 30 minutes to cook, Sanders’ pressure cooker reduced that time to nine minutes. But, in 1954, they built Interstate 75, which bypassed Corbin. Business dried up overnight.So at the age of 64, Sanders took to the road, with a pressure cooker and a bag of seasoning. He visited restaurants and demonstrated his recipe, asking them to put it on their menus, in return for four cents for every chicken they sold cooked his way. It was the start of a nationwide franchise that allowed him to sell up in 1964 for $2m (£1.5m), staying on as a $75,000-a-year ambassador until he died in 1980. It became a suitably rousing American Dream story for the marketing men to exploit.Now Sanders is being resurrected by a new generation of executives. Fried chicken may be thriving nearly everywhere on the planet, but in America, its birthplace, KFC has had a serious wobble as slicker rivals do a better job at winning over fickle millennials.KFC’s global headquarters is in Dallas, Texas, a modern glass-and-brick building on a business park with its own staff basketball court and test kitchens. Here I meet Roger Eaton, the chief executive. A 6ft 3in South African, dressed in jeans, he has a swaggering bonhomieand is keen on high-fiving and talking about football.One of his tactics in reviving KFC’s flagging fortunes in the US has been advertising – hiring a number of high-profile comedians and actors, including Rob Lowe, George Hamilton and Billy Zane, to dress up as Harland Sanders. “The adverts in the US are very distinct,” Eaton says. “The minute you see the Colonel on the television you say” – he snaps his fingers – “‘That’s a KFC advert.’ That’s the challenge: getting that distinctiveness when young people have an attention  of a goldfish, eight or nine seconds.”His innovation team has used social media astutely, launching a number of hyperbolic products that hit the menu for just a few weeks in order to generate a frenzy of Instagram posts and retweets. There’s been the chizza, developed by KFC in the Philippines – a pineapple and ham pizza where instead of a dough base, there is a piece of deep-fried chicken. In France, KFC is launching a croque monsieur, with slabs of deep-fried chicken replacing the slices of white toast.For now, this tactic is working: sales in the US have recovered and the UK, after the DHL fiasco, is back on track. But long-term, KFC needs to address a slow but inescapable shift in eating habits. Young people are becoming more interested in their food and the impact their consumption is having on the planet. In the UK, the number of vegans has tripled in the last 10 years, to 540,000 – or many more. Experts believe this figure (from the Vegan Society) underestimates the number of people who may not be fully vegan, but are “flexitarians”, actively seeking to cut back on meat for health, environmental or ethical reasons. The ethics of eating barn-reared chickens, who rarely if ever see daylight and are slaughtered after 32 to 45 days, is very much up for debate.KFC was described by the author Jonathan Safran Foer in his book Eating Animals as “arguably the company that has increased the sum total of suffering in the world more than any other in history”. He pointed out that, in 2004, workers at one of the company’s main suppliers were filmed jumping up and down on live chickens and kicking them like footballs. KFC vowed at the time to deal only with suppliers that promised a commitment to animal welfare.Eaton, who has been chief executive since 2015, insists KFC has had a good record in recent years. “I cannot tell you how seriously we take animal welfare. I take it personally. I visited numerous chicken plants in my life and I am very comfortable about what we do.” It’s true that the company has been free of the animal-cruelty scandals that dogged it a decade ago. And in the UK, all KFC chicken is Red Tractor, an assurance scheme that guarantees the chickens are British-farmed and stocked slightly less densely than EU minimum standards. Under EU legislation, broiler chickens (those grown for meat) can be kept in sheds with up to about 21 adult birds per square metre Red Tractor’s scheme allows up to about 19 birds – though a requirement for its sheds to have windows is only being introduced from 2020. Last month, Red Tractor came under fire after it emerged that just one in 1,000 farm inspections were made unannounced (the percentage should be much higher).But even if its customers are comfortable with KFC’s animal welfare standards, its health credentials are hardly golden. Chicken is lower in fat and higher in protein than beef, but the moment you deep fry it, you are transforming it into something pretty calorific. A three-piece original recipe meal, not the largest thing on the menu, contains 1,035 calories, way more than a Big Mac meal at McDonald’s (845 calories).Eaton is aware how KFC, along with other fried-chicken outlets, has become the whipping boy in the public obesity debate – certainly in the UK. When he was campaigning for the mayoralty, Sadiq Khan said that, “London has too many chicken shops”, lumping them together with pawnbrokers as a blight on the capital’s high streets.Since Khan came into office, he has put his London Plan out to consultation, which includes a proposal to ban hot food takeaways from opening within 400 metres of a school. One council has already acted, with Redbridge in east London implementing the ban earlier this year.Regulators also appear more willing to act against fast food companies that target children. Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled KFC had broken guidelines by placing a billboard for a KFC Mars Krushems drink too close to a primary school. KFC said it was an error and took the advert down the moment it was alerted.Eaton takes the line, one that fast-food executives have adopted for some time, that they are not really the problem. “We could go into a KFC store and we could comfortably have a meal for anywhere between 500 and 800 calories. If you apply common sense, KFC fits incredibly comfortably into a balanced diet. Hey, I’m living it.” That’s all right for him to say. He’s a tall man, and at 90kg (14st 3lb) would be classed as healthy on the Body Mass Index scale. But when pushed, he acknowledges that – even if most customers eat a KFC only once a month – the company needs to do a better job of engaging in the obesity debate. After talking to Eaton, I visit a branch of KFC’s main rival in the US, Chick-fil-A. It has half the number of US restaurants as KFC (about 2,200 US branches) but is growing far faster. In a downtown Dallas branch I meet Nikki Webb, 50, an office clerk, who says, “I would chose Chick-fil-A over Kentucky Fried. I prefer the taste – it’s more natural.” Chick-fil-A, as well as frying, grills a lot of its chicken. “Years ago, yeah, I had fried chicken the whole time. But I do worry about how unhealthy it is,” Webb says. “The health movement in the US is so big now. I think fast food is one of the worst things you can do to harm your body. So, I try to stay away from it.” She has ordered a yoghurt.Sarah Jacob, 39, who works in finance, echoes her views. “Where will fried chicken be in 10 years’ time? I think all these chains will be making adjustments, just as Chick-fil-A has. It has a kale salad on its menu, which is so good.” There is no kale on a KFC menu. In fact, in the US restaurants, it is hard to find any greenery apart from some cabbage in the coleslaw.Still, each country is allowed to develop its own dishes, so long as they don’t mess with the 11 herbs and spices. Jack Hinchliffe, 35, is the head of innovation for KFC in the UK, in charge of coming up with new menu items, from its British HQ in Woking, Surrey. He’s been with KFC for three years and has been closely watching the rise of healthy eating and veganism. “The data suggests this is more than a passing fad. Young customers are more engaged than they’ve ever been about the provenance of their food, the story of their food. Meat-free, flexitarian lifestyles will continue to grow. That’s something we’re aware of and seek to respond to.”To this end, Hinchliffe developed the rice box for KFC in the UK: a carton of Tex-Mex steamed rice, a green salad and tomatoes, with slices of fried chicken on top. “We developed the rice box to have a great, permissible way to enjoy KFC. It’s 500 calories. It’s a much lighter, healthier product. It is hitting a critical calorie count.” Using grilled chicken would seem the obvious way to cut calories, as Chick-fil-A has done, but Hinchliffe does not think this is the answer. “Our fans and guests don’t want a grilled product or an oven-baked product. We have tried those. They come to KFC for our fried chicken.” And fried chicken is what KFC will give them, even if it is alongside a salad rather than a portion of fries.It will become an increasingly difficult circle to square. KFC needs to offer healthier dishes, to keep abreast of social change, and keep politicians off its back. But any success and social media hype it enjoys tends to stem from the fact fried chicken remains, at its heart, comfort food: greasy, crispy, salty and, for many customers, very tasty.Back in Corbin, I ask Leslie Shriner how her meal was – her first KFC since she was a teenager. “You know what? It tastes good. Just how I remember. It’s juicy, tender and crunchy.” Even though she would usually order an organic salad for lunch? “Hey, there’s a nostalgia thing going on, for sure. There’s comfort. It’s like eating Mom’s cake.”Her new partner, Jeff, pipes up: “Will you come and eat fried chicken again with me?”“It’s the most famous recipe in the world,” says KFC chief executive Roger Eaton. Developed by Harland Sanders in the 1930s and 40s, the spice blend is still used, and a big part of the company’s marketing. KFC uses two separate flavour suppliers, with one mixing up half the blend before shipping it to the second, to reduce the risk of the exact 11 being leaked. It arrives in all restaurants pre-mixed, and is then added to flour, dried egg and milk powder to coat chicken before cooking.Eaton, mostly very chatty, says: “I won’t answer any questions about the secret recipe. Seriously.” He then pauses. “Except to say it’s very secret and there are very few people in the world who know it, and there are very few people who know who does know it.”Does he know it? “I won’t answer that.”In August 2016, the Chicago Tribune reported that a nephew of Colonel Sanders had claimed to have found a copy of the recipe in a scrapbook. “Many people have made these claims over the years and no one has been accurate,” KFC said about the article. “This one isn’t either.” However, the recipe was:If you really want to know the identity of the spices, you can excavate the cornerstone of the Colonel Sanders Technical Centre in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1986, 11 vials containing the secret ingredients were embedded into a concrete block.• Commenting on this piece?

Whether it was Arsenal obligingly presenting their hosts with a healthy lead or, having revived, carving them open at will only to fluff their lines in front of goal, or Chelsea wilting at the back as if defensive responsibilities had been discarded with Antonio Conte, deficiencies were to the fore.Sarri declared the last 15 minutes of the first half “horrible” and time in which it would have been “better to go for a cigarette”. The confusion made for a frenzied match but both managers appeared to age in their dugouts at the glorious mess they were witnessing. What ultimately set Sarri’s team apart was the magician to whom they could turn to on the bench.Hazard returned late from the World Cup and had spent most of the contest clad in his tracksuit, trotting up and down the touchline while suffering the goading of the travelling Arsenal fans behind one goal. There had been a period this summer when Chelsea, expecting Real Madrid to formalise interest in their prized asset, had fretted over the 27-year-old’s future at the club.Sarri had admitted as much on the eve of the game, with Hazard having suggested on the conclusion of Belgium’s World Cup campaign that the time might be right to move on. Yet here he was still in blue, asked to restore some order with 29 minutes remaining, and driving Arsenal deeper and deeper into their shells at the end.It was his isolation of the visitors’ panicked substitute, Alexandre Lacazette, which was key to coaxing Chelsea’s winner. Hazard darted to the byline far too easily beyond the static forward and, while Arsenal desperately attempted to clutter the penalty area with bodies, Marcos Alonso meandered on to the cutback to finish past Petr Cech.Hazard, not content with that impact alone, would force his former team-mate into two smart saves in what time remained, and should have supplied Olivier Giroud with another. “I’d rather be out on the pitch than watching from the bench,” he offered through a smile. “But, when I did come on, I did good.”Life without Hazard is unthinkable, and the club’s priority should be to convince him to buy into Sarri’s project and commit to the club. All that talk of a £300,000-a-week contract has gone rather quiet.Sarri is already acutely aware of Hazard’s significance to this team’s good health. How Emery, slumping into his dugout as his side were breached for a third time, must wish he had a game-changer who can provide similar gloss to his own work in progress.Arsenal, soundly beaten by Manchester City last Sunday, have now lost their opening two top-flight fixtures for the first time since 1992, though the new manager will still cling to the positives from this occasion. Some of their approach play in that opening period had been scintillating, and far too good for Chelsea to repel, for all that it was also undermined by profligacy.They would score twice, through Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s skimmed finish and Alex Iwobi’s shot from the Armenian’s cutback, and took heart from the recovery, but it was the memory of all the misses that lingered.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Mkhitaryan and Iwobi would all sky shots over the bar from around the penalty spot. Other fine opportunities were spurned by Mesut Özil and Aubameyang – who will surely score far harder chances this season – with such wastefulness combining with uncertainty at the back to have alarm bells ringing early. There are already question marks over both centre‑halves and whether they possess the pace to thrive in Emery’s high‑press system.Likewise, discipline was lacking at times. Héctor Bellerín, such a threat in the attacking third, was up field and absent as Jorginho slid Alonso free early on. The Spaniard’s centre was converted crisply by his compatriot Pedro in the centre.Then there was the ease at which Álvaro Morata trundled on to César Azpilicueta’s lofted pass over Nacho Monreal – maintaining the Spanish theme – to score for only the second time in the Premier League since Boxing Day.“Calm,” preached Emery. “I know we need to improve things and push the players to work. But, for me, the team competed well and had chances in the match.”Neither side expect to challenge for the title. Sarri admitted that starkly – “No, not in this moment” – in the aftermath of this victorious start to life at Stamford Bridge. Regardless, both these teams will be entertaining to watch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab4eed8df6ff3e1661da386b4d1bff0f8647486/0_110_4683_2810/master/4683.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e48b40ae7158acf5f241537afc05da19","title":"cristiano ronaldo chievo juventus serie a match report","story":"Juventus came from behind to snatch a dramatic 3-2 win at Chievo as Cristiano Ronaldo made his debut for the Turin side on Saturday, although the Portugal captain was not among the scorers in his first Serie A match.Ronaldo was thwarted several times the by veteran Chievo goalkeeper, Stefano Sorrentino, and his handball in the buildup led to a late Juventus goal being disallowed.Sami Khedira put Juventus ahead after three minutes but the visitors were stunned when Mariusz Stepinski levelled seven minutes before the break.Emanuele Giaccherini then scored a penalty against his former club to give Chievo a shock lead in the 56th minute – only for Chievo’s Mattia Bani, under pressure from the returning Leonardo Bonucci, to deflect a corner into his own net in the 75th minute.Juventus had a goal disallowed for handball by Ronaldo but, in the next attack, Federico Bernardeschi turned the ball in to give the reigning champions a winning start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98dd164a19c8fbe9d27770fc54495bd761fcc866/26_322_6184_3712/master/6184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8182aa89f034ca08f2be59d69135653a","title":"tottenham fulham premier league match report","story":"There were echoes of England’s World Cup summer as Tottenham put a bad week behind them to claim victory over Fulham. Unfortunately for the Spurs team, however, playing like a side that finished fourth in Russia is not what Mauricio Pochettino is after.A superb free kick from Kieran Trippier and Harry Kane’s first Premier League goal in August turned the match in Tottenham’s favour after Aleksander Mitrovic had cancelled out Lucas Moura’s first-half strike. For Pochettino, however, this was not good enough and he demanded his side become more clinical if they are to become winners rather than just gallant runners-up.Trippier, making his first start for Spurs since starring for England in Russia, was at the heart of everything Tottenham did in this match. If his delivery had been better, in the first half in particular, they would have won the match at a canter. Still, he managed to score the goal of the day, a sweet free kick from 25 yards out that bent inside Fabri’s right-hand post.As for Kane, he sealed the victory with a typical goal 13 minutes from time, stepping inside Calum Chambers and firing low with his right foot into the far corner. The captain has found himself in the odd position of having won the Golden Boot in Russia while apparently struggling for form. Here he was back to something closer to his best, looking sharp in and around the box and providing a stern physical challenge for Fulham’s centre-halves.“I am very happy for Harry,” said Pochettino of his captain. “It was important for him to feel the net in this period. If not we might have made a big trauma for him. He came up to me after the game to tell me that: ’gaffer I have done it!’. We have a little disadvantage in fitness and preseason but if you have a good mentality you can compete.”Moura scored the opening Spurs goal in the 43rd minute, his first in the league for the club, curling home inside the far post after another cross from the right had been blocked. But Fulham came out the better side after half-time and Aleksander Mitrovic had already hit the post before he equalised in the 52nd minute, stooping low to head home after a cute layoff from Ryan Sessegnon.Pochettino responded to the goal immediately with a change of formation. Ironically, an England-style 3-3-2-2 with Moura alongside Kane went to a 4-2-3-1 with Mousa Dembélé replacing Davinson Sánchez. Soon Spurs were on the front foot again. As Fulham tired openings began to spring up and the home side enjoyed another period where they might have scored many more than just their two goals.For Slavisa Jokanovic there were no lessons to be learned from this match that weren’t apparent already. “We know where we are,” the Fulham manager said. “We played a complicated away game against one of the top Champions League teams. They showed quality but on the other side they showed they’ve been playing for three years together. We’ve played two and a half weeks together. We are a Premier League team in a building process, we are going to need the time. We showed a few positive things, but without any doubt we need to fix our problems. The only way I know how to do that is to work hard.”There were positive signs for the visitors, not just the Mitrovic goal and the Sessegnon assist but in the combination of £40m central midfield recruits Jean Michaël Seri and André-Frank Zambo Anguissa. Their next fixture is a home encounter with Burnley, another big challenge. Spurs, meanwhile, travel to Manchester United where Pochettino is yet to win in the league, or even score a goal.“I am disappointed but I am also happy‚“ Pochettino said in summary after this eventful match. “Old Trafford will show us whether we are ready to challenge at the top or not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

And that signals the end of this MBM report. It’s been quite a rollercoaster ride. Congratulations to Chelsea, commiserations to Arsenal. Hope you enjoy the rest of your Saturday night, whoever you support.Maurizio Sarri speaks! “It was a wonderful game, a wonderful match. It was very hard for us, but we did well. We were in control of the match. We have to work, because in 15 minutes we conceded four or five opportunities, so we have to work.”Unai Emery speaks to BT Sport. “The first half, we created good chances to score. For that I am happy. They had chances to score, and it was 2-0 for them, but our reaction was good. The half-time was good for us. We tried to gain control and create chances, but we did not keep possession. We had more chances, but we didn’t do it. We are playing with midfielders who are 19 and 22 years old, they will improve with experience.” Huge credit to Emery, who isn’t hiding from the media despite Arsenal’s tough start to the season. He could easily claim his English isn’t quite up to speed yet, and give the TV the big bodyswerve, but he comes out and communicates very well.Eden Hazard is asked whether Maurizio Sarri should be given time to implement his ideas. His answer suggests nobody at Chelsea is hiding behind the age-old Transitional Season excuse. “In the Premier League we don’t have time. We just want to win game after game. But he is a good manager, like we had before. We just want to enjoy winning games.”Chelsea were deserved winners of a very strange match indeed. They were the dominant force throughout, against a team whose defence can most charitably be described as a work in progress. They should have had a hatful. But then, so should Arsenal, whose performance was beyond erratic: as a creative force, there’s not much wrong with them. Despite being overrun for most of the game, Arsenal could have ended up, absurdly, as winners had they shown even basic competence in front of goal. Just one of those odd affairs. Given we’re so early into the reigns of both Maurizio Sarri and Unai Emery, it’s unfair to draw too many conclusions. Expect both teams to be put through some more defensive drills in training on Monday morning, though.90 min +3: One last chance for Arsenal to launch a Hail Mary. Guendouzi sends it long. It’s intercepted, and Hazard and Giroud tear upfield, two on one. Hazard dribbles into the box, then lays off to Giroud on his left. Giroud’s desperate to score against his old club, but his low bang is smothered by Cech.90 min +2: Kante bursts down the left and nearly opens Arsenal up. Not quite.90 min +1: It’s gone scrappy, and Chelsea are more than happy as the clock ticks on.90 min: Nearly! Ramsey latches onto a loose ball, bouncing to the right of the Chelsea D. He unleashes a screaming looper past Kepa and inches over the bar. There will be three added minutes.89 min: Bellerin crosses deep from the right. Too deep. Time is seriously against Arsenal now. Is there one last twist to this berserk match?87 min: Alonso embarks on basic run down the left. There’s nobody in red anywhere near him! Where is Bellerin (pt. XXXVIII)? Alonso reaches the byline, meanders into the box, and cuts back for Giroud, whose attempt to find the top left is denied by Cech.86 min: Giroud flicks the ball down the inside-left channel to release Hazard into the area. He shoots low from a tight angle, but Cech is equal to it.85 min: Bellerin makes a determined romp down the right wing, but Alonso refuses to let him glide inside.83 min: Arsenal win a free kick out on the left, and parlay it into a corner on the right. That comes to nothing, and Hazard very nearly romps up the other end on the break. Arsenal are grateful to the promising young midfielder Guendouzi for putting a stop to his gallop.Lacazette plays a poor backwards pass that puts Chelsea in. Hazard dribbles down the left, and makes it to the byline. He flicks low, towards the near post, where Alonso sidefoots powerfully past Cech! So simple. But what was Lacazette doing?78 min: Mustafi is booked for coming through the back of Hazard. Then Pedro is sent skittering down the left. His cross finds the head of Kante, ten yards out. Kante flashes his header over the bar.77 min: Ramsey, just inside the Chelsea box on the right, has a low diagonal whack at goal. Kepa fumbles, then recovers. Aubameyang, having gone for the loose ball, lightly clatters the keeper. Kepa is furious, but the striker had every right to go for that. The referee agrees. We play on.76 min: Arsenal shift the ball right to left through Ramsey and Lacazette to Monreal, who has space in front of him as he enters the box. A heavy touch allows Azpilicueta to block. A chance gone.75 min: Alexandre Lacazette comes on for Alex Iwobi. Chelsea make a change too: Olivier Giroud comes on to face his old club, Alvaro Morta making way.73 min: Luiz sends the free kick up over the wall and back down towards the top-left corner. It’s punched clear with great purpose by Cech.72 min: Torreira is booked for a cynical trip on Kovacic as the Croatian dribbles down the inside left. This is a free kick in a very dangerous position. 71 min: Chelsea have had 88 percent of the possession during the last five minutes. Right now, there’s only one team winning this. But we’ve been fooled by this game before.70 min: Hazard spins down the left and zips clear of Bellerin. He reaches the byline and fizzes a low ball across the face of goal. There’s nobody in blue lurking to snaffle an easy goal.68 min: Mesut Ozil is replaced by Aaron Ramsey. He takes an age to troop off.67 min: Chelsea continue to ping it around. Azpilicueta curls in a cross from the right, but Morata can’t beat Ozil to the header at the far post.65 min: Arsenal are being pinned back in their final third right now. Papastathopoulos has a couple of chances to clear, but his headers upfield aren’t particularly useful. Pedro has two digs from distance. Neither come off.64 min: Corner for Chelsea on the left. The ball’s worked to Jorginho, who is in a ludicrous amount of space on the edge of the box. He takes a touch and shoots ... not particularly well, given the time he had. His shot, sent towards the bottom left, takes a wicked deflection but Cech is able to change direction and gather.63 min: Chelsea ping it around patiently. Hazard suddenly slips a ball down the middle and Morata is free in the box! His low shot is blocked by Cech, and he’s offside anyway.62 min: Some pinball in the Arsenal box. Azpilicueta can’t find anyone with a low cross Pedro has a shot that’s immediately blocked.61 min: A double substitution by Chelsea, as Willian and Ross Barkley are replaced by Eden Hazard and debutant Mateo Kovacic.60 min: Iwobi bursts with great belief down the middle of the park ... then with options either side, plays a slide-rule pass out of play for a goal kick.58 min: A loose backwards header in the midfield by Jorginho. Ozil latches onto it and helps it forward to Aubameyang, who scoots free of the last man and buries a shot into the bottom left. But the flag’s up, correctly the striker needlessly went too early.57 min: Pedro has a belt from the edge of the area. Papastathopoulos blocks, but Barkley picks up the loose ball, gently chips it down the inside-right channel, and chases after it himself. Breaking into the area, he sends a low diagonal shot towards the bottom left. Cech, at full stretch, fingertips round the post. That’s a glorious effort, and an even better save. Nothing comes of the resulting corner.56 min: Morata wins a corner off Mustafi down the right. Willian hoicks it long, but nobody in a retro 80s blue shirt can get their head to it at the back stick.54 min: Alonso and Willian try to open Arsenal up with some neat one-twos down the left. Not quite. “This is like watching an episode of Robot Wars,” opines Hubert O’Hearn. “Two mindless, defenceless, attacking machines absolutely bludgeoning one another. Can we get Dara O Briain on play-by-play please?”52 min: Arsenal are caught out playing from the back. Pedro robs Mustafi and lays off for Kante, who has a shot from the edge of the box. Papastathopoulos blocks, then falls on the ball. Chelsea claim a hand ball and a penalty, but there’s no way they’re getting that: there was little contact with ball and arm, and there was no intent anyway.51 min: Bellerin races down the right and loops a cross into the centre. Aubameyang and Monreal confuse each other as the ball drops towards them, level with the left-hand post. Chelsea are able to clear.50 min: Guendouzi lofts a pass down the middle. More juice on it, and Aubameyang was tearing clear on goal. As it is, Luiz is able to intercept.48 min: Barkley bustles out of a pocket on the left and makes off towards the Arsenal box. The ball’s rolled across to Pedro, to the right of the D he attempts a curler into the top left. It’s high and wide. And this game is still as open as it was in the first half.47 min: The ball’s launched long for Aubameyang, who dribbles past Luiz with great ease, then fires a low cross through the six-yard box. Ozil wasn’t far away from meeting that and running it into the net.Right, we’re off again! Chelsea get the ball rolling for a half of football that can’t be more outré than the first 45. It simply can’t be. Surely? Anyway, Arsenal have made a change, bringing on Lucas Torreira for the trundling Granit Xhaka. Meanwhile here’s Kári Tulinius: “Smart people like to say that the World Cup is a lagging indicator, and no longer sets the tone for football globally. But this game is only a politically motivated pitch invasion and a rain-soaked president short of being as weird as the last World Cup final. Let’s hope this is a trend.”How on earth do you parse all that information?! Chelsea could easily be leading 6-2. Arsenal, an absolute shambles at the back but in their element up front, probably should be leading 6-2. As it is, it’s merely 2-2. Merely 2-2! That was less a half of football, more a 47-minute hallucination.45 min +1: This is getting really silly now. Bellerin feeds Mkhitaryan down the right. Mkhitaryan reaches the byline and cuts back ... whereupon Iwobi becomes the third Arsenal player to clank one over the bar from the penalty spot, missing an open goal!45 min: There will be two added minutes of this first half. Can there be another 22? 44 min: Iwobi twists and turns down the left. He crosses low towards the near post. Aubameyang sends a first-time slapshot inches wide of the bottom left. Arsenal are utterly transformed! As are Chelsea. This half of football has been positively psychedelic.43 min: Guendouzi cuts in from the left and forces Arrizabalaga to scrabble around by his right-hand post. It’s only fair to point out how poor Chelsea are defending now. Bellerin slips in Mkhitaryan down the right. Mkhitaryan pulls a ball back. It’s Arsenal’s third gilt-edged chance from the penalty spot! And this one’s converted, Iwobi smashing the ball straight down the middle and high into the net. Arsenal are level!40 min: Arsenal have visibly grown in confidence, though. An awful lot of pinging around in midfield. Then ...38 min: This game is weird. Arsenal have been so bad at the back, yet they’re only a goal adrift of Chelsea and have missed two open goals. Kante goes romping down the right and lays off to Morata, whose curling effort from 20 yards, aimed for the top right, is tipped over spectacularly by Cech. Nothing comes of the resulting corner.Monreal robs Willian 30 yards from goal. He feeds Iwobi, who drifts left before pulling a ball back for Mkhitaryan. He pearls a shot into the bottom left from the edge of the box, Arrizabalaga left with no chance! 36 min: Pedro tries to curl one into the bottom right from the edge of the box. Cech snaffles that one easily. Pedro had options either side then it was maybe the wrong decision to shoot.34 min: Willian is found in acres down the left again. Bellerin was running infield at the time. Willian wanders to the byline and cuts back for Kante, whose shot from the penalty spot is blocked. Arsenal’s right wing is being ripped to shreds. Bellerin is freestyling all over the place, and he’s not getting much support from Mkhitaryan further up the flank."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2680dce50b0c7d1fe21c5a1392697fd4ef5ee3ff/0_1716_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4023ff599a38660c34a73f386b0db602","title":"caroline lucas so much time is wasted in parliament","story":"The MP talks about fearing for her life in Cambodia, getting arrested and how Westminster makes her swear more than she shouldA girl named Rachel transformed my childhood.

It opened my mind to ideas I could never have dreamed of.I organised a strike at my secondary school. Lessons were cancelled, but we weren’t allowed to go home. In retrospect, I can see the safeguarding issues that might have created, but at the time it felt the greatest injustice.In 1986 I had my lightbulb moment.

Yes, there’s the aesthetic of Brighton – the sea, the Lanes, the Downs – and I’ve never felt a stronger sense of community.

The most high-profile instance was when protesting at the fracking site in Balcombe. It’s an industry which will undermine our chances of tackling climate change. I don’t take civil disobedience lightly, but protecting our climate felt bigger than a law that says don’t sit down.The Green party is full of inspirational people, but they need to be given space to shine. That’s the primary reason for me standing down as leader.My private life doesn’t feel relevant to my work, but I know I couldn’t do what I do without my husband and family, that’s what matters. I give myself to politics, I keep my family for me.I felt so lucky to cross the threshold of parliament as the UK’s first Green MP, riding the wave of decades of work by others. It felt monumental, a chance to change the course of history, and a bloody long time coming, too. It’s this I’ll always be most proud of.Don’t tread on one another’s dreams, that’s the secret to a happy relationship. We celebrated our 27th wedding anniversary a couple of weeks ago. We try to make the space for each other to follow our passions, whatever they may be.So much time is wasted in parliament. When I was an MEP votes took a matter of seconds, but in Westminster we spend 20 minutes each time walking through the lobbies. It’s archaic and it’s stupid. It makes me use the F-word more than I should.I’m still learning to make time for things that matter to me. I want to spend more of my life in nature and with my family, to read more books and explore the spiritual aspects of life. The thing I am most afraid of is running out of time.We still haven’t woken up to the dangers of climate change. What else does nature have to throw at us?

Not any moreOn holiday in Corsica, I ate a lot of cheese: le niolo, which is made from goat’s milk and so addictively delicious I would sometimes eat a slice at breakfast, lunch seeming too far off and brocciu, a fresh, ricotta-like cheese made from ewe’s milk that is excellent with bread and salad and rosé, but which we also ate in the form of a rich but pleasingly unsweet ice-cream. Naturally, my dreams grew worse with every day that passed cheese gives me nightmares. But my consumption grew exponentially. And even when I wasn’t eating it, I was talking about it. Beside the pool, my friend S and I would describe the characteristics of our favourites out loud to one another, two crazy voluptuaries with pink shoulders and sun-frazzled hair.I love cheese. It came into my life when I was nine, and my parents took me to France for the first time – we ate oozing supermarket camembert in some long grass by the side of a country road, and I knew in an instant that Dairylea triangles would henceforth no longer quite do it for me – and there it has remained, centre stage, ever since. Lately, though, it has begun to play an even more vital role in my life. When, not so long ago, my worries about Brexit threatened to take over my waking hours – if I wasn’t picturing the 13-mile lorry park that will be the M20 some time quite soon, I was thinking about medicines and which ones, if any, I should try to stockpile – cheese stepped in, acting as a kind of proxy, a repository into which I could hurl all my other anxieties. What I mean is that I now fixate almost exclusively on what supplies of brie and chaource will be like next spring – and the rest is just so much noise.My friend the shrink tells me that she regards this as a pretty nifty psychological mechanism, a form of repression that allows me to fret a little, but not too much – and doubtless she’s right, up to a point. Then again, perhaps she does not quite grasp my deep feelings in the matter of cheese (if she did, I bet she would already have tried to make me do some form of lactose-based cognitive behavioural therapy).Eating paper-thin slices of young comte the other evening, I thought, like some lover turned half-mad with longing: comte! I only discovered you a decade or so ago, and now you are set to leave me. I find that I know almost by heart the most concerning details of the LSE’s recent report on the impact of Brexit on the UK dairy industry, and that bits of it now float unbidden into my mind at all manner of moments.Last week, having somehow resisted the purchase of a tiny, almost loopily overpriced French cheese in a local deli – oh, the darling way that green frond was wrapped around its ashy rind – I suddenly remembered the words of the man from Arla, the dairy that commissioned the study. Thanks both to disruption to the supply chain and vastly increased tariffs, if we leave the EU with no deal, he noted, speciality cheeses may soon become “very scarce”. Reader, you know what happened next. I turned around, pulled a fiver from my wallet, and swiftly bought the little fromage that was barely the size of a 50p piece. If things go on like this, I’ll be broke even before the tariffs arrive.It’s no use people making jokes about red Leicester, and how I’ll come to love it, ha ha. Until such time as Britain vastly increases its milk production, we’re dependent on EU countries such as Denmark and Germany if we want to maintain our own supplies of cheddar and, yes, red Leicester – which is something I will, once this long hot summer is over, think about every time I stick a slice of cheese on toast under the grill.No writer can live without rubbery cheese on toast, and no true cheese lover without, say, gouda so old you taste crystals with every bite. Given that I’m both things, I must therefore prepare for the worst. As my dear shrink friend would also say: alas, repression works only up to a point. Even as I type, the fear rises. What grim times.

There was no emergency – I was simply so overwhelmed at being left alone to look after her, and she looked so fragile that I didn’t want to hurt her by bending her delicate little arms. So I resorted to scissors.I am sure most new fathers feel helpless, and even after nine months’ preparation, terrified of doing the wrong thing. But I didn’t even have the luxury of those nine months of pregnancy to get ready – I had just three hours’ notice. At 11.45pm on 11 May 2015, I was 29, carefree and child-free. By 12 May 2015 at 3am, I was a dad.It began with my girlfriend’s “appendicitis”, as diagnosed by the 999 operator. Except it wasn’t: she was in labour. Until then, Lyndsay, whom I had been with for three years, had no symptoms of pregnancy: she had been taking the pill and had even been losing weight. Neither of us even remotely considered she might be pregnant. That day, I hadn’t heard from Lyndsay since lunchtime, so I was blissfully unaware until her mother called me at 11.50pm. I knew something was seriously wrong, because she refused to say anything until I was sitting down. When she said Lyndsay was in labour and I was going to be a father, I couldn’t speak. The baby was coming, imminently.When I put the phone down I stood there, stunned, my mind in overdrive. I wasn’t ready to accept the responsibility everything was happening in the wrong order.I had always said that I didn’t want children, but if ever I chose to, it would be after marriage. The very idea of fatherhood made me shiver in fear I had never even held a baby. I had to get to that hospital, but I couldn’t think straight, so I phoned my best friend. She was equally confused and surprised, but stayed with me on the phone for the entire journey. She told me to think about Lyndsay, who would be terrified, and to keep her posted. Just sharing the news helped calm me down.When I made it to the hospital, Lyndsay’s mother was waiting for me. As she led me down the corridor to the maternity ward I felt as if I was walking the Green Mile. At the same time, I was desperate to get to her. As I entered the delivery room, Lyndsay was still insisting to the midwife that she wasn’t pregnant and, in between words of denial and inhaling gas, rolled around in pain on the bed. When she spotted me she burst into tears and blurted out how sorry she was – she knew I didn’t want children. I did all I could to reassure her it was going to be OK, but the truth wasI didn’t have a clue what was going to happen.The midwife showed us our baby on a monitor, but it was too late to determine the sex or health Lyndsay just had to go for it. She was already 8cm dilated and told that she couldn’t have an epidural. I held her hand tightly as she cried out.It was approaching 3am when our daughter was born, and I was the first to hold her. She was wrapped in a towel and had an angry, confused cry and yet, as I took her from the midwife, I felt nothing but unconditional love. I had convinced myself fatherhood would be my own personal version of hell, but at that moment I understood how wrong I’d been.It wasn’t until later that morning, alone with our daughter for the first time, that it dawned on us: she had no name. We chose Bella – the first I suggested. We discussed how Lyndsay andBella would move in with me and that I would be there, despite the challenges.But that was the easy part. Apart from a 10-minute conversation I had with a nurse, who told me to “support the head and you can’t go wrong”, I didn’t know what I was doing. I was sleep-deprived, scared and clueless. Then social services unexpectedly turned up to talk to Lyndsay in hospital. They explained they had to look into all cases of “concealed” births, just in case of familial abuse. Lyndsay described how she had recently been feeling extra tired but had assumed that it was down to a new job, not a baby. (The midwife explained that Bella had been hiding in her back, hence no bump.) I was also visited at home to ensure that it was a suitable environment to bring up a child. We reflected on the places we’d been and the mad things we had done while Lyndsay was pregnant. We certainly wouldn’t have gone ziplining the weekend before Lyndsay gave birth, had we known. Four days later, Bella and Lyndsay came home. By then I wasmentally much more prepared. As soon as the front door closed and I placed Bella into her moses basket, everything felt calmer. My perspective on the world had totally changed in the space of those three hours, between finding out she was on her way and her birth. I had grown up overnight.

Then the novichok poisonings changed the moodA few months into making my show Sam Delaney’s News Thing, which I hosted for two-and-a-half years on RT UK (the channel formerly known as Russia Today), we made a sketch called Diana in Heaven. It featured the writer and broadcaster Andy Dawson dressed in a blond wig and pearls, giving celebrity gossip reports from the afterlife. Dawson is a middle-aged, overweight man from Sunderland. He delivered his (awful) impression of Diana in front of a shabby celestial backdrop, while swigging from a can of lager. The production team and I thought it was hilarious, but when the channel boss saw it he was unimpressed. “You cannot broadcast this sketch!” he told us in his firm Russian accent. “There are some thingsthe British public just won’t accept.”So we removed it. I mean, we liked it, but not enough to make a stand and fall out with the channel. We were surprised they took the memory of the Princess of Wales so seriously. After all, it was the first – and almost the last – time RThad interfered in any of our output. But in many ways, the incident embodied our relationship: fun, yes, but also a bit stressful and confusing.I first entered RT’s London studios in 2015, when I was promoting a book I had written about political advertising, Mad Men \u0026amp Bad Men. I had never heard of RT, but my publisher told me it was a good place to sell books such as mine because it had a politically engaged audience.I was interviewed by Afhsin Rattansi, the British journalist who now hosts RT’s news show, Going Underground. Charming but provocative, Rattansi had previously worked on Radio 4’s Today programme and CNN. The interview was surprisingly robust but I enjoyed myself.On my way out, a producer told me he was in the market for a topical comedy show. At the time, I was still editor-in-chief at Comedy Central UK, and he thought I might have some ideas. I did. I had been developing a format with the producer Ben Rigden, who once ran The Big Breakfast and Richard \u0026amp Judy, as well as devising Fighting Talk for BBC Radio 5 Live. Together, we came up with a show that featured me as host, plus a panel of guest comics and journalists, and a big political interview. It was anarchic and irreverent and frequently stupid. It was probably too daft to be described as proper satire mostly, we were inspired by the spirit of Viz magazine.But the channel seemed to like it. I was introduced to the boss, Nikolay Bogachihin (who remains the only Russian person I ever met there). He is a quietly spoken man in his late 30s whose deadpan persona, I learned, hid a very good sense of humour. I liked him a lot. He commissioned a pilot. The guests on our first, unaired episode were the comedians Sara Pascoe, Richard Herring and Des Clarke, alongside an interview with the former SNP leader Alex Salmond (this was years before RT gave him his own show). It went well enough for the channel to commission six months’ worth of episodes.I was, by then, aware of RT’s reputation. The channel is part-funded by the Russian state and some of its coverage of the conflict with Ukraine had been criticised for extreme pro-Russian bias. Ofcom, the body that regulates every broadcast news outlet in the UK, had censured RT for its lack of impartiality, as well as for presenting misleading information over the BBC’s coverage of a chemical weapons attack in Syria (RT claimed the BBC had staged the attack). Its discussion shows were frequently accused of giving platforms to screwballs and conspiracy theorists.My own concerns were obvious: would the channel try to bend our daft entertainment to some sinister political agenda? My gut said it was unlikely. They already had enough angry content. I was confident they wanted an outsider who could lighten the mood a bit. Nevertheless, we decided to proceed with extreme caution.I told Bogachihin that my production company would make the show independently and sell it to RT. We wanted to maintain stringent control – over everything from the guests we booked to the scripts we wrote. At the time, Going Underground and the channel’s local news coverage were all produced by an in-house team we were RT’s first independent commission. Since then, there have been several more, including Alex Salmond’s political discussion show.During the week, we produced the show from our offices in Southwark, south London. On Fridays we went to RT’s studios on the 16th floor of Millbank Tower in Westminster to record the show. From the offices, there are sweeping views across the river to the MI6 building and out to the Houses of Parliament. Our guests loved that.In one of our first episodes to air, in November 2015, we covered the Russian Olympic doping scandal, and delivered what we thought was a provocative depiction ofRussia as a nation of cheats. It was our way of testing the water. The channel checked it before it went out (a standard procedure for any broadcaster) and made no changes. We started to feel reassured.As time went by, we were astounded by the freedom we were given. Some of the stuff we broadcast on News Thing was so juvenile, offensive and, sometimes, terrible that we expected to be kicked out at any moment. But we rarely saw the boss we rarely had any interaction with the channel at all. That was almost suspicious in itself. Everyone on News Thing had worked for terrestrial channels for years none of us had ever experienced such laissez-faire management.For its first 18 months, the channel seemed to fly under the radar. Not many people paid attention, and the audience for News Thing was under 40,000 a week. But we attracted a big social media following, and made it our business to generate as much noise as we could. We booked high-profile political guests such as John Prescott, Alastair Campbell, Neil Kinnock and Vince Cable. Rising stars of the Tory party, including MPs James Cleverley, Johnny Mercer and Kwasi Kwarteng, also appeared. We booked columnists from all the main papers: Giles Coren, Andrew Pierce and Michael White, the ’s former political editor, were regulars on our panel.We teased our guests, made them play silly games and encouraged them to muck about. Ken Livingstone sang a duet of the Phil Collins track Easy Lover with me to close an episode. Former Ukip leader Paul Nuttall was subjected to a phoney psychometric test while wearing a colander on his head covered with wires. Prescott ate a platterof oranges sprinkled with Oxo cubes, a tribute to Cilla Black. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves and most returned for more.Our most famous prank was getting a little girl to dress up as the Queen and pretend to knight Nigel Farage. We had primed her to say: “My mummy says you hate foreigners.” The clip went viral, with 4m views and made headlines around the world. George Osborne was one of the first to retweet it, along with the comment: “This deserves a wider audience.” The comic Sarah Silverman shared it with her 10 million followers alongside the comment: “THIS IS THE GREATEST THING EVER!” For a while, the show felt like it was flying.Then, in the autumn of 2017, things started to get difficult. Some of our political guests were criticised for receiving payments to appear. They weren’t breaking any parliamentary rules we were an independent show paying our guests pretty standard appearance fees of £500 – much less than a BBC panel show like Have I Got News For You. The most we ever paid was £2,000. But some of our regulars started to feel nervous about being associated with RT.Conspiracy theorists – and even some mainstream journalists – began to accuse us of being part of what they called Putin’s propaganda machine. This seemed laughable to us. For a start, we had complete editorial independence. Plus, everyone involved in making the show was essentially left of centre, your typical metropolitan liberal dickhead types (including me). Our output was often dumb and sweary, but usually balanced and pretty moderate in its views. We criticised Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn equally. The show was consistently pro-remain. The channel’s marketing slogan was: “Question more”. It was true that programmes such as Going Underground or George Galloway’s weekly discussion show liked to challenge what they saw as the lazy bias of western neoliberals by comparison, News Thing was positively wishy-washy and mainstream.But RT didn’t seem to care much about us. Even when our Farage stunt went global, Bogachihin just smirked and said: “Just the sort of thing that you liberals find funny, I suppose.” I started to question what my role really was. “Useful idiot” is a term I learned from watching Homeland on Channel 4, a phrase used by Russian intelligence operatives to describe a seemingly benign court jester who provides handy distraction from the more sinister stuff. Was I RT’s useful idiot?Interestingly, the RT social media team would seem particularly supportive of this sort of output, heavily retweeting the show – perhaps because these speeches were critical of the government and scornful of the state of British society. They paid far less attention when we were just being silly, or more mainstream in our views.We spent just a few hours in the RT studio each week, and had little interaction with the channel’s staff. But when the Daily Mail published an “inside report” of the newsroom in November last year, I had seen enough to know it was widely exaggerated. The article portrayed a sinister propaganda machine, with rows of journalists hunched over computers producing fake news. The truth, as far as I could see, was rather more mundane. Almost everyone who worked on RT’s news team was British. They were mostly young journalists, many in their first jobs, gaining what looked like valuable experience in news reporting and television production. Most of them seemed bemused by the perception that they were employed as propagandists. I remember the day Theresa May got up in the Commons to give her statement following the novichok poisoning of Sergei and Julia Skripal in Salisbury in March. I was told that, at Millbank, young RT journalists gathered around the TV nervously waiting to see if she would (as some MPs proposed) shut the channel down. They all had rent to pay and were scared about the fallout of being caught up in a geopolitical scandal.The scene was very similar in our production offices. We knew the writing was on the wall. Overnight, the negativity surrounding the channel increased hugely, largely fed by RT’s questioning of Russia’s culpability in the poisoning. The show and everyone who worked on it was at risk of being stigmatised by association.Our contract would come to an end in June, and we decided we would not renew. It was becoming harder and harder to book guests. The MPs who had become friends of the show told us, off the record, that they couldn’t come on any more their party chiefs had forbidden them from appearing.In the end, the channel got there first. They told us that they expected to be shut down by Ofcom sooner or later, and had been ordered by Moscow to cut their independently made shows. I was called into Bogachihin’s office as we prepared to record a show in late April. He was honest and frank about the decision, even joking that “now at least you won’t have to listen to people saying you work for Putin”. I got the sense that, if it had been down to him, Bogachihin would have kept the show going: the positive news we generated was a respite from all the criticism. But my overriding feeling was one of relief. I had enjoyed making News Thing, but the association with RT had become toxic, however sure I was of our own independence.Oddly, other independent shows – Alex Salmond’s, for one – have continued. Perhaps they were deemed more reliably anti-establishment. Hiring an extremely high-profile politician such as Salmond had been a real coup for RT, and certainly his chatshow was a better fit than my weekly output of profanity and pranks. Ultimately, News Thing didn’t have enough impact on the channel’s reputation one way or the other. In that sense, I was more of a useless idiot.Were we naive in going to work for RT? I don’t think so. In 2015, it was not particularly controversial. Yes, we knew there were Kremlin links but we were satisfied by the channel’s Ofcom-regulated status, as well as its pledge to allow us complete editorial independence.We were also attracted by their risk-taking mentality. We had more creative freedom than any of us had had elsewhere, from the BBC, ITV, Sky, the  and pretty much every other mainstream media outlet you might care to mention. And despite this, we were (slightly disappointingly) never once sanctioned by Ofcom ourselves.The truth is, RT was the only channel that wanted us in 2015. Had the BBC or Channel 4 or anyone even a bit less controversial wanted to broadcast the show, we would have bitten their arm off. But I’m not sure we would have been afforded the same freedom.In a news story about our 2017 Farage stunt, Buzzfeed’s then political editor Jim Waterson (now the ’s media editor) wrote of News Thing: “Although RT has been repeatedly accused of being a propaganda front for the Kremlin’s interests in the West, it is unclear how this show fits into that pattern.” And he was right. We never knew how we fitted in, either.Commenting on this piece?

No longer, due to what they and their Blairite plotters are doing to my party and the long-suffering people of Britain who need a radical Labour government.”Labour said it could not comment on inidual cases, but that complaints of antisemitism were “fully investigated”.Corbyn’s team has been frustrated by the row over its handling of allegations of antisemitism in the party, which has prevented them from spending the summer developing a programme for government.Corbyn’s presence at a gathering in a Tunis cemetery in 2014, at which a wreath was laid at the graves of figures connected to the Black September group, was a source of controversy running throughout last week. The group conducted the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed.Corbyn has said that he was present but not involved in the wreath-laying. He said that he was at the gathering to commemorate the victims of the 1985 Israeli airstrike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation offices in Tunis. The row followed criticism of Labour for refusing to adopt the full definition and examples of antisemitism as set out by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.Some of Corbyn’s closest allies, including the Unite union boss Len McCluskey, have urged the party to adopt the full definition. It is now preparing to do so, but wants to ensure legitimate criticism of Israel is not curtailed.A survey by Deltapoll published in April suggested that half of the electorate believed there were at least pockets of antisemitism in Labour. That poll was carried out shortly after a demonstration outside parliament against antisemitism within the party.

He bought books – lots of them. Thirty years on, the 50-year-old council worker is surrounded on all sides by his ever-growing collection: 15,000 books and DVDs fill his small bungalow on the outskirts of Edinburgh. “It’s quite tricky to let go of some stuff,” he admits.Woods is a hoarder, as is his housemate Lynda. They’re midway through an anxiety-ridden declutter, which has already resulted in one transit van full of “stuff” being taken away, with about six more left to fill. By the end, they hope, there may even be room to sit down.“If I was living in a big, posh house and had this amount of books on the shelves, they would call it a library,” he said. “Nobody would go ‘Oh, Lord Toffington is a hoarder!’ But because I’m living in a bungalow and I’m the underclass, I’m a hoarder.”The World Health Organisation this week classified hoarding as a medical disorder, in a move described by hoarders and psychiatrists as “extremely significant”. According to the WHO, the disorder is characterised by an “accumulation of possessions due to excessive acquisition of – or difficulty discarding – possessions, regardless of their actual value”.The issue is far more complex: hoarding is often linked to other serious mental health issues, such as childhood trauma or clinical depression. Not all hoarders live in unhygienic homes, nor are they all fiercely opposed to letting go of possessions.“The television programmes add to the shame and embarrassment because if you say you have hoarding issues people immediately relate that to the TV and think they’re dirty. They call it entertainment but it’s just reinforcing stereotypes,” said Linda Fay, the founder of the hoarding support company Life-Pod.Woods said he did not realise he had a problem until a mental health support worker visited his home three years ago. “I just thought it was normal to buy a lot of books you don’t necessarily read.”His eclectic collection includes tomes on microbiology, magic and tarot cards, but his “latest splurge” has been on books about inequality and politics. It stems from “a feeling of not knowing enough”, he said. “I panic and go, ‘Oh my God! I need to understand.’”Woods has received help from Life-Pod for three years. It takes time and patience, he says, but “there is hope to deal with it”. Treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy are often prescribed by the NHS but rarely work, campaigners say, while forcing someone to simply clear out their possessions – as espoused by some local authorities and private landlords – often has disastrous consequences. Fay said she has known hoarders to kill themselves after being forced to get rid of their belongings.The embarrassment often felt by hoarders means many suffer in silence, according to Jo Cooke, a director of Hoarding Disorders UK. Just this week, Cooke said, police had to force entry to an elderly man’s house after neighbours found him collapsed in his garden. When officers arrived, they found a house filled to the ceiling with tools. He had five woodchippers, countless lathes, and a cement-mixer in his dining room alone.A former engineer, the man lived alone in the house where he was born. He had never sought help for hoarding. “We don’t know how long he had been living like that,” said Cooke. “His house was a toy room for a grown-up. When I spoke to him about what he could keep and what he could lose, recognising he would have anxiety, he said: ‘I want all my tools – everything else can go.’”The WHO classification was a “watershed moment” for hoarding disorder, said Paul Bertuello, a 59-year-old antiques buyer who lives with a blind three-legged cat named Minkyand a lifetime’s worth of valuables in a small cottage near Bath.Sitting on the corner of his bed, Bertuello stares at a 1.5-metre tower of what, he says, can “only be described as rubbish”. His home is named Boot Cottage as everything he owns and wears was bought at a car boot sale.His past employment as an antiques buyer has morphed into an almost uncontrollable desire to track down historical objects at bargain prices. Bertuello wears a 2,000-year-old Roman ring, and a silver piece of eight dangles from his left ear. Somewhere in his bedroom is a 200-year-old solid silver catheter and a pair of second world war fighter goggles.While his collection might sound eccentric, Bertuello says his hoarding is a byproduct of clinical depression, which he has had since his twenties.He said he hoped the WHO decision would lead to a greater public understanding of the condition: “It’s often quite a secret illness. It’s very, very difficult for people to empathise with you because it looks very silly.“It looks like you’re a lazy idiot and ‘get off your backside’ but I’ve suffered depression all of my life. I say to people: ‘I would love to invite you round for coffee but I’m afraid I can’t – you couldn’t get through my front room.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a8b8cd796af9b9e4ea6cf3f7a69abc25883f92e/0_368_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7295e5b4f207a8a4f12950389fd456c","title":"minimum wage workers pay price big british companies squeeze suppliers","story":"A fifth of British companies have found they use suppliers who are either paying their staff late or at illegally low rates, a survey has found, raising further concerns about the treatment of vulnerable workers.Suppliers to one in 10 British companies are failing to pay the minimum wage, according to a survey of managers for the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply.Industry figures said they expected such abuses to get worse as a result of Britain leaving the European Union when companies are likely to squeeze their suppliers even more to cope with rising costs. Further rises in the minimum wage could also encourage bosses to break the law.There are already concerns about insecure employment practices, with more work contracted out to workers who are not officially recognised as employees.The government’s adviser on enforcing labour laws has renewed his call for measures to stop the violations. David Metcalf called for new powers to seize goods temporarily, more pressure on big brands whose suppliers are acting illegally and stricter rules to ensure no public money goes to companies whose suppliers are breaking the law.Metcalf said that he expected to find some “major issues” in his investigation into practices in the hotel, warehousing and restaurant industries. The findings will be published next year. “We are going to go into this in depth,” he said. “I suspect that when we start turning the stones over, we’ll find one or two things that are not as they should be.“This is a serious problem and if the government were to adopt the measures that we propose on supply chains in our strategy, it would be helpful in tackling it.”Rises in the minimum wage have helped millions of workers since its introduction in 1999, when it was set at £3.60 an hour for most adults. It has since risen to £7.83 for people aged 25 and over, falling to £3.20 for apprentices.However, the increase has been accompanied by a rise in the number of people complaining about being underpaid. Complaints reported to HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs doubled from 2,513 in the year to April 2016 to 5,053 a year later. Many more cases are thought to go unreported.Cath Hill, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, said: “The vast majority of British businesses would agree that short-changing their employees is inexcusable, but when it comes to the workers further down their supply chain they don’t have the same level of concern.“Too often it is the people at the bottom of the supply chain who feel the pinch. As a country we must take meaningful action against businesses who reap the benefits of worker exploitation in their supply chain.”A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Any employer who breaks minimum wage rules and short-changes their workers can be hit with fines and public naming, as well as having to pay their workers the back pay.“Last year government investigators identified £15.6m in back pay owed to 200,000 minimum wage workers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d52e31c4eb2d6be8a2a520b318c022428988d06/0_123_4704_2824/master/4704.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31adb576a58d220cfd9e33d8aa510fec","title":"reece prescods late surge fractionally short of catching christian coleman","story":"• Briton loses 100m at Birmingham Grand Prix by 0.001sec• Matthew Hudson-Smith fails in 400m British record attemptUnder gunmetal skies Britain’s Reece Prescod fired a shot that will surely be heard around the sprinting world. This time, however, he was left ruing the fact he squeezed the trigger a thousandth of a second too late.At one stage the 22-year-old was dead last in a stacked men’s 100m final in the Birmingham grand prix. But once he hit top speed Prescod finished like a bullet train, flying past many of the world’s best sprinters to finish in a personal best of 9.94sec.Initially it also looked good enough for a sensational victory. But after officials had pored over two angles of the photofinish they ruled that the American Christian Coleman had got the nudge by 0.001sec.But Prescod has the confidence of knowing now he is the real deal, especially given he was fatigued from winning silver at the European Championships in Berlin last week. And if he can fix his start – which too closely resembles an elderly man rising from his favourite chair for comfort – he is a legitimate contender for gold at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.“I’ve been so tired after the Europeans, and I’ve just been dying every day trying to regain my fitness,” said Prescod. “I have gone back to work on a few things with my coach and I’m still trying to ace my start. I just need to get it a tenth of a second better.” The good news for British sprinting is that Prescod is working on it.After Berlin he treated himself to a new projector to allow him to do video analysis of his races on the big screen at his house, and it is already paying off.“I was also looking back at how I was last year, when I ran 10.04sec consistently and I was thinking when I was running like that I was really relaxed and bouncy, so I just tried to bring it,” he explained.“In the final everyone was tensing up in the last part of the race but I was like ‘Nah, don’t make that mistake. Just stay tall, stay bouncy, and you will just come through.’”And how. Behind him was Zharnel Hughes, the new European champion, Yohan Blake, a former world champion, and Noah Lyles, the brash American who also happens to be the fastest man of the year. “The Americans think they are very dominant but hopefully I have done our country proud and tried to show the British boys can sprint,” added Prescod.“Obviously the Americans are world-class competition – they are the guys I have to beat.“I feel like I am definitely close but I still have a lot of work to do to get stronger and faster.”Coleman, though, had a message back for his rival. “I have the utmost confidence in myself. I know when I am healthy and at my best I am hard to beat.”Elsewhere the performance of the day came from the South African Luvo Manyonga who jumped a meeting-record 8.53m to win the men’s long jump in what was also Greg Rutherford’s final stadium competition of his career.Rutherford, who has decided to retire due to a serious left-ankle injury, could finish only eighth after a modest 7.34m.But the crowd – many of whom sported ‘Thank You Greg’ stickers – applauded him like a champion.“It’s so frustrating to not be competitive any more because I don’t train any more and that’s down to the fact I am just too injured,” he said.“But I am also incredibly lucky to have an opportunity to come out in the stadiums one last time to wave to the crowds, sign lots of autographs and meet lots of people because that’s part of what I think as an athlete you should do.”Manyonga, who beat Rutherford to gold at the Rio Olympics, also paid tribute to his friend and rival. “Greg has been great and we’ve given him a farewell as one of the best long-jumpers in the world.”Another of the day’s best performances came from the Kenyan Emmanuel Kipkurui Korir, who won the men’s 800m in a meeting-record 1:42.79. “It’s a great achievement and I thank God for what I have done,”he said.However, Matthew Hudson-Smith fell short in his attempt to break Iwan Thomas’s 21-year-old British 400m record after fading to finish second behind the American Fred Kerley in a modest 45.59sec.But Hudson-Smith claimed he was not too disappointed.“It was a good race and it is all slowly coming together,” he insisted. “My coach will be happy with how that race was executed because I was a lot more patient than at the Europeans when I went off like a rocket. Things look bright for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6e1c99b993898f6d8e073002ddd5302df50994f/0_32_4512_2708/master/4512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1903fd43b33b4d36fafad8dda70badce","title":"virat kohli india england third test","story":"Marshalled by their captain, Virat Kohli, India reignited this series as a contest. After their humiliation at Lord’s India finished a fine day of Test cricket on 307 for six with Kohli and his vice-captain, Ajinkya Rahane, compiling a crucial 159-run partnership in the afternoon. This was a source of great relief to the Indian camp, tempered by the loss of Hardik Pandya to the last ball of the day. Perhaps even more uplifting than that stand between two familiar names was a cameo at the end from India’s debutant, Rishabh Pant. He was only 22 not out at the close but I have a hunch this might have been an “I was there” moment.Joe Root opted to let his bowlers loose after winning the toss and they did not respond particularly well to the challenge. There was less movement available than at Lord’s or Edgbaston but some mild encouragement for the pacemen. Too often India’s latest opening pair were able to watch the ball pass harmlessly outside the off stump.It is hard to argue with 978 Test wickets but the preference of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson to bowl to a 7-2 off-side field may contribute to them erring in line. Both have the admirable yearning to be mean but with two men on the leg side there is the temptation for them to bowl a little too wide. Just occasionally they over-compensated and Shikhar Dhawan, restored to the side in place of Murali Vijay, capitalised with leg-side boundaries.With remarkably few alarms India sped past fifty without losing a wicket as the introduction of Ben Stokes accelerated the run rate. It was not supposed to be like this, but in the second hour Chris Woakes, the England all-rounder who has only ever entered a court with a tennis racquet, intervened.Having replaced Anderson at the Ratcliffe Road End, Woakes found enough movement to test batsmen gaining in confidence. His pre-lunch spell suggested England would continue to torment the batsmen. First he found the edge of Dhawan’s bat and Jos Buttler at second slip held a neat catch then Woakes dispatched KL Rahul with a brute of a delivery, which swung away a little before nipping back devilishly.Rahul was given LBW and set off on his lonely return (apart from the presence of a TV cameraman, who will one day bear the brunt of a batsman’s anger) but Cheteshwar Pujara pursued him and told him to ask for a review. Rahul followed that advice, whereupon three red lights instructed him to continue his journey. It seems as if Pujara’s umpiring is on the same level as his running between the wickets.In the last over before lunch Pujara was also undermined by Woakes. The Warwickshire all-rounder delivered the solitary bouncer in his spell Pujara was surprised and he sensed runs before skimming a hook shot straight to long-leg, where England’s least reliable fielder was stationed. Adil Rashid steadied himself and took a taxing catch at chest height to enable England to take lunch in a buoyant mood.There would be no more scalps for England in the next four hours as Kohli and Rahane combined with remarkably few alarms. They were suitably wary against Woakes and Anderson, England’s most dangerous bowlers, but runs were easier to come by when Stokes and Rashid were in harness.Root could use Rashid only sparingly in his first spell as he yielded runs so easily. This was not so surprising since the leg-spinner has never been the solitary slow bowler in an England side and required to hold an end up while the pacemen have a breather. Kohli stroked effortless boundaries on either side of the wicket. After five overs and 29 runs Rashid was removed from the attack.For the first time in the series two India batsmen were in unison in the middle the pitch was sleeping, the ball softening, the bowlers tiring. It took a millisecond of brilliance to break the partnership. Alastair Cook has taken 165 catches for England and my suspicion is that the one he snatched on Saturday to dismiss Rahane was his career-best.Rahane edged a drive against Broad. Initially, it looked like Jonny Bairstow’s catch but the keeper did not move. So, late in proceedings, Cook lurched to his left and stuck out a hand and there the ball magically came to rest. Even more astounding was the air of nonchalance that Cook retained as he got to his feet, which was eventually betrayed by a beaming smile.There would be another slip catch of significance soon afterwards. It was a much simpler one and it was taken by Stokes off the bowling of Rashid. The importance lay in the fact that the batsman was Kohli, three runs short of his century. Until then Kohli had played Rashid with consummate ease but now he drove away from his body at a leg-break. Suddenly, the concerns about Rashid’s profligacy were shelved.Out came Pant, a stocky left-hander and capable wicketkeeper on his Test debut. He crunched his first delivery hard to extra cover to his second, a googly, he advanced down the pitch to drive the ball straight for six, a remarkable display of derring-do. Pant became the 12th man to get off the mark in Test cricket with a six New Zealand’s Mark Craig is the only one to do so from his first ball. The list contains very few notable batsmen most are impudent bowlers. Until Pant, the best was probably West Indies’ Carlisle Best. Already the young Indian looks as if he might be better than that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4119566628b9f498cbdb8e87e3bb89d08ec4ee74/286_468_1878_1126/master/1878.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f9052adbef48bfead138f1a0dc89791","title":"england v india third test day one live","story":"England won the toss, put India in and were frustrated as Ajinkya Rahane and Virat Kohli, who eventually fell for 97, put on 159 for the fourth wicketThat’s all from me. Tim and Adam Collins will be here for more tomorrow. Bye!Having lost a wicket from the last ball before lunch, another from the last ball of the day, and their captain just before his century, India will feel they could have done better. They have still done very well, mind, established a solid foundation in this match, and if they bat through one full session tomorrow (or longer) their total will develop a genuinely daunting look. Given the cloud and the wind at the toss, England will have hoped for more.Here’s Rashid on taking Kohli’s wicket:I was trying to keep it nice and tight and mix my pace up. Fortunately for me that went a bit slower, in the driving range, and he just nicked it.And here’s Rahane on Rishabh Pant: “He’s been doing really well for India and in IPL. Right now he’s really confident and that’s what matters at the highest level. You don’t think too much about your skills, the more confident you are, the better.”I think it’s a good score on this wicket. Unfortunately we lost Hardik in the last over, but we were looking to put pressure on the opponent. In the end it was a good score. It could have been better. 320-4 would have been really good. Intent was important on this wicket. Our openers played really well and we thought if we get a good score, the middle order could capitalise on that. Our focus was to rotate the strike as well as put bad balls to the boundary.Intent was positive throughout. It was slightly slow, but after lunch I feel it was really good to bat on.Sky switch straight to Surrey Stars v Western Storm in the Women’s Super League, so we might not get any player reaction from Trent Bridge. And that’s your lot! The wicket was taken with the final ball of the over, and with a few minutes still to go until the 6.30pm cut-off, but there’ll be no more. 87th over: India 307-6 (Pant 18) Anderson bowls a lovely inswinging yorker. Hardik just about gets his bat down in time to survive it. But it turns out that was just softening him up: the next delivery moves away, takes the edge, and Buttler takes the catch at second slip.Got him! Great bowling by Anderson, and this time he gets rewarded!86th over: India 307-5 (Hardik 18, Pant 18) Broad’s first delivery goes for four his last hits an inside edge and flies into Pant’s back leg and then to safety. Still the breakthrough doesn’t come, and England are running out of time. There might be three overs left today, perhaps only two.85th over: India 303-5 (Hardik 18, Pant 18) How the wickets aren’t tumbling here is a mystery. Anderson’s last two deliveries are crackers, but those wickets remain resolutely untumbled.84th over: India 303-5 (Hardik 18, Pant 18) Oooh! That’s a lovely delivery from Broad, pitched full, moving away, forcing the batsman to play. Pant clips the next one through midwicket for four, but then Broad does him again with one that moves away. And again! Great over, unaccountably unrewarded.83rd over: India 299-5 (Hardik 18, Pant 14) Hardik edges low and hard, and Jennings has no chance with this one. The ball flies past him on its way to the boundary.82nd over: India 294-5 (Hardik 14, Pant 13) Hardik leaves the first three balls of Broad’s over but then nibbles at the fourth and gloves it gently to third slip, where Jennings es to his right and unaccountably puts it down! It’s hard to see how he managed to drop it, and Broad is certainly at a loss. “How?” he screams. Dunno.81st over: India 294-5 (Hardik 14, Pant 13) The ground is bathed in late-afternoon sunlight as Anderson stands at the end of his run-up, fresh cherry in his hand. He bowls his first ball, but he doesn’t like the depth of the foothole he’s landing in, and after a chat with the umpire a couple of groundsmen are called on to deal with it, using a variety of novelty instruments. Eventually play resumes, but Pant is largely able to leave the new ball entirely alone.80th over: India 292-5 (Hardik 14, Pant 11) A couple of singles off Rashid’s ninth over, and the new ball is now due. What’s more, it looks like England are going to take it.79th over: India 290-5 (Hardik 13, Pant 10) Pant reins in his big-hitting instincts and eventually gets a single.78th over: India 288-5 (Hardik 12, Pant 9) Pant gets off the mark with a six! Kohli’s dismissal had been followed by seven dots, and just as an atmosphere of total calm appears to have set in, Rachid’s second delivery is smacked back over his head for a maximum! That’s a hell of a way to score your first Test runs.77th over: India 279-5 (Hardik 12, Pant 0) That’s a maiden from Stokes. England will have a new ball available in three overs.76th over: India 279-5 (Hardik 12, Pant 0) I failed to mention that Rashid had bowled the 74th over, the one in which Hardik wasn’t out. He hadn’t really looked very likely to make a breakthrough, but then suddenly there it was: a nicely flighted delivery, and a vitally important wicket.Got him! Kohli edges and the ball flies straight into the hands of Stokes at slip!75th over: India 277-4 (Kohli 95, Hardik 12) Stokes has the opportunity with the ball to atone for his review-demanding, but he doesn’t immediately do so. Kohli moves on run closer to his ton.74th over: India 276-4 (Kohli 94, Hardik 12) England are now clean out of reviews. That was a very strange one: there was no appeal, and literally only one person was at all interested. I trust that Stokes is suitably embarrassed about that, and that Root has learned to trust his instincts a little more in future.The ball could hardly have been further from the bat. It flicked the pad on its way through. A useless waste of a review.Nobody at all thinks so, except for Ben Stokes. He’s so convinced there was an edge it makes up for everyone else’s uncertainty, and Root eventually decides to review it.73rd over: India 272-4 (Kohli 94, Hardik 8) Stokes bowls, and Kohli scores a couple of twos. Or two couples. India’s captain is within sniffing distance of his century now. He has 22 Test centuries to his name, and has only once been dismissed in the 90s, in Johannesburg five years ago.72nd over: India 268-4 (Kohli 90, Hardik 8) There’s some swing here for Anderson. There’s also a boundary for Hardik, pushed through the covers.71st over: India 264-4 (Kohli 90, Hardik 4) Broad gets the ball to swing into the batsman, and then it swings right past the batsman, and past the wicketkeeper too, and it merrily swings all the way to the boundary. And the players will now enjoy some drinks.70th over: India 254-4 (Kohli 84, Hardik 4) “I am obliged to point out that many have been written in languages other than English,” writes Sayak Mukherjee. “My favourite book ever is দিশি গান বিলিতি খেলা (Native music, Foreign Sport) by Kumarprasad Mukherji. Extraordinarily written and infinitely amusing, this is the book that has given me a lifelong love for both cricket writing and Indian classical music. If the cover does not make you want to learn Bengali and read it immediately, nothing will.”69th over: India 253-4 (Kohli 83, Hardik 4) Hardik gets off the mark with a boundary, nicely times and place past mid-on. “I’d be interested to know if anyone else has a copy of Vic Marks’s The Ultimate One Day Cricket Match,” writes Charlie Miller. “Written in the mid-80s with Robin Drake, it’s a choose-your-own-adventure book where you are miraculously plucked from obscurity to become captain of an England team (of the GowerBotham era) playing a one-dayer against a Rest of the World XI including Viv Richards, Allan Border, Malcolm Marshall etc. I picked it up in a small bookshop in the middle of Somerset in the mid-80s but have never ever come across anyone else who has ever heard of it.” Ah, choose your own adventure books. A profoundly bad idea, but they entertained me for a while in my childhood. I’ve also never heard of this one, sadly.68th over: India 248-4 (Kohli 82, Hardik 0) Anderson immediately takes over from Woakes. Kohli’s momentum hasn’t stalled, though, and he hits a lovely shot through cover. “I would highly recommend Slipless In Settle,” says Ben Falkiner. Harry Pearson, once of this parish, is a brilliant writer always worth seeking out. It’s worth buying the book just for its title.67th over: India 241-4 (Kohli 75) You know things are going badly for England when Ben Stokes misfields. It only costs a run, but still. But then, from the final ball of the over, England’s luck changes. Rahane flashes his bat and the ball flies fast to Cook’s left. He probably expects Bairstow to go for it, but the keeper stands still and at the last second he flicks out a hand and it somehow sticks! On Sky, Ian Botham immediately declares it the finest catch of Cook’s career. What a catch from Cook! What a grab that is!66th over: India 236-3 (Rahane 77, Kohli 74) Woakes bowls short to Rahane, who swings at it and flicks it away for four, and then Kohli pushes down the ground for four more, before finally Rahane flays past point for another boundary. That’s a 17-run over. “How about Penguins Stopped Play by Harry Thompson,” writes Eddie Simmons. “A wonderful story of an enthusiastic cricketer and his attempts to organise a team and play cricket on all seven continents. Funny, beautifully written and also one of the most moving books I’ve read in a long time.”65th over: India 219-3 (Rahane 68, Kohli 66) “How has no-one mentioned Life, the Universe and Everything by Douglas Adams yet?” boggles Tim Myles, referring to this bit, as Kohli pulls the ball away for four:“The game you know as cricket,” he said, and his voice still seemed to be wandering lost in subterranean passages, “is just one of those curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images in the mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the midst of time. Of all the races in the Galaxy, only the English could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the Universe and transform it into into what I’m afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game.“Rather fond of it myself,” he added, “but in most people’s eyes you have been inadvertently guilty of the most grotesque bad taste. Particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the wicket, that’s very nasty.”64th over: India 214-3 (Rahane 68, Kohli 61) Woakes bowls. A couple of singles are scored.63rd over: India 212-3 (Rahane 67, Kohli 60) This Broad over is a million times less dramatic than the last, with no wickets threatened and no insects ingested. A good ing stop on the rope keeps the scoring down to two.62nd over: India 210-3 (Rahane 67, Kohli 58) Woakes bowls short and wide, and Rahane fair hammers it away for four. “Has no one suggested Fatty Batter by Michael Simkins?” writes Jeremy Beswick. “A must for all enthusiastic but incompetent cricketers like me. If it doesn’t make you laugh out loud you’ve no soul.”61st over: India 206-3 (Rahane 63, Kohli 58) Oof! That’s a beautiful delivery from Broad, drawing Kohli forward, moving gently away, and leaving the batsman helpless as it flies just past the bat. And then another cracker! The final ball of the over jags away from Kohli, who is again lucky to get nothing on it. In between, Broad has to pull out of a delivery after, with the bowler haring along at full speed, a fly flies into his mouth. There’s some speculation that he was stung by a wasp, but he looks insufficiently pained to me.60th over: India 206-3 (Rahane 63, Kohli 58) More bad luckjudgement for Anderson in the field, as he runs round to cut off a ball nudged wide of Jennings at third slip, slides, attempts to flick it back to Root, misses it and slides with it into the rope.59th over: India 200-3 (Rahane 62, Kohli 53) India complete their second collective century, helped by Rahane edging the ball between slip fielders for four.58th over: India 194-3 (Rahane 57, Kohli 52) Stokes’ first ball catches Kohli’s leading edge, but all that comes of it is a single. And then Rahane’s dropped! He absolutely cracks the ball to backward point, where Anderson jumps, gets both hands to it, pushes it into the air with his fingertips and watches it plop harmlessly to the turf. Given how fast the ball was moving it was a very difficult chance, but a chance it still was. 57th over: India 193-3 (Rahane 57, Kohli 51) The first ball of the session, bowled by Broad, is pushed past cover by Rahane for a fine four. “An outfield choice of cricket book from me: Shadows on the Grass by Simon Raven, the novelist and screenwriter,” suggests Chris Bourne. “This is a scabrous memoir of cricket matches at Charterhouse school, and various international grounds as his short army career (he was kicked out for unpaid debts at his bookie) tossed him around the fag end of empire. It opens with a homosexual dalliance in the scorebox at Charterhouse and includes a tale of the young Peter May urinating out of a train window as it passed through a station. Beautifully written and never a dull moment.”Right then! A(nother) key session awaits. England had the better of the first, India enjoyed the second, and now the hosts need wickets or they will head to their hotel feeling all sorts of glum.56th over: India 189-3 (Kohli 51, Rahane 53) Woakes continues, which means Root has paid him the ultimate compliment and given him as many overs as Anderson (15). He bowls one un-Andersonian ball, a bouncer, going down leg, which brings only four byes. And that’s tea, with India back on top, just about, thanks to their biggest and best stand of the series, an unbroken 107 between Kohli and Rahane. “It’s been disciplined and full of class,” says Isa Guha. England badly need a wicket on a day when only Chris Woakes has been incisive, and Anderson and Broad have had to settle for moral victories. Simon will be here after the break I’ll see you in the morning. Thanks for your company and some entertaining correspondence.55th over: India 184-3 (Kohli 51, Rahane 52) Stokes peppers Rahane, who lets one bouncer hit him between the shoulder blades. Quite a vivid example of taking one for the team.54th over: India 183-3 (Kohli 51, Rahane 51) Woakes too sends square leg off into the deep, but it’s a double bluff – he tries a yorker, which turns into a full toss, straight-driven for a single by Rahane. The script surely demands a twist before tea.53rd over: India 182-3 (Kohli 51, Rahane 50) Stokes comes on for a spot of bodyline, clearly signalled by a short leg and a deep square. One bouncer has Kohli flirting outside off, with a stroke that’s halfway from a nibble to a smash another is called wide, which is an eccentric way to bring up the hundred partnership. “Enough of this,” says Robert Wilson. “There is only one cricket book. The Pickwick Papers. Dickens may not have known much about the game but he recognised an opportunity for spoofing it loads when he saw one. This is Pickwick’s first meeting with a grifter, Mr Jingle. Is there any one of us who has not heard the same kind of shtick in some rained-off village 3rd XI game?‘Played it! Think I have—thousands of times—not here—West Indies—exciting thing—hot work—very.’ ‘It must be rather a warm pursuit in such a climate,’ observed Mr. Pickwick.‘Warm!—red hot—scorching—glowing. Played a match once—single wicket—friend the colonel—Sir Thomas Blazo—who should get the greatest number of runs.—Won the toss—first innings—seven o’clock A.M.—six natives to look out—went in kept in—heat intense—natives all fainted—taken away—fresh half-dozen ordered—fainted also—Blazo bowling—supported by two natives—couldn’t bowl me out—fainted too—cleared away the colonel—wouldn’t give in—faithful attendant—Quanko Samba—last man left—sun so hot, bat in blisters, ball scorched brown—five hundred and seventy runs—rather exhausted—Quanko mustered up last remaining strength—bowled me out—had a bath, and went out to dinner.’‘And what became of what’s-his-name, Sir?’ inquired an old gentleman.‘No—the other gentleman.’‘Poor Quanko—never recovered it—bowled on, on my account—bowled off, on his own—died, sir.’”That’s great. I had no idea that Dickens had invented the OBO.52nd over: India 181-3 (Kohli 51, Rahane 50) A rare bad ball from Woakes, short and wide, gives Rahane a nice way to bring up his first fifty of the tour. He’s done very well after coming in in a semi-crisis, at 82-3, and having the whole lunch interval to think about his first ball.51st over: India 177-3 (Kohli 51, Rahane 46) Anderson to Kohli: no alarms, but a maiden, which is (a) quite a feat when Kohli is well set, and (b) the zillionth of Anderson’s career.And here’s an unusual email from David Hooper. “Hi Tim – ref your request today for cricket memories from the older listeners... I was an Essex schoolboy in 1948 when the Australian cricket team arrived. It was to be Bradman’s last tour. I had missed it, but most of my school friends had seen the famous match versus Essex when the Australians had scored 721 in one day – albeit on a ground at Southend with a very short boundary. However, I caught up with the tour when Australia played at Lords versus - I thought the MCC – but the records show that it was the ‘Gentlemen of England!’, effectively the regular England X1.“I can recall very little of the cricket, apart from seeing at the nets a gnarled oldish bowler, who I now know was Doug Ring. I watched from The Mound, then uncovered but free, and recommended by a couple of old codgers I had met in the queue outside the ground.Mid-afternoon, all play was abandoned because of rain, and the Old Codgers invited me to watch the Real Tennis for a while. I had never heard of this sport. Later I realized that they were a pair of gate-crashers who had been entering the Members Only door to the Real Tennis courts for many years without understanding either the rules or the score system! That tennis episode has stuck in my memory.” Love those codgers. They must have been born around the time Test cricket began.50th over: India 177-3 (Kohli 51, Rahane 46) Root has lost faith in Rashid, not that he had very much in the first place. Woakes returns, and his first ball is propped down to third man by Kohli, who goes to yet another fifty. He’s recovered from the injury and insult of Lord’s, and is surely eyeing a big hundred.“Just emailing in on my day off,” says my colleague Tom Davies, “to add that Simon Lister’s Fire in Babylon book - developing the story covered in the film of the great West Indies teams of the 70s and 80s - is a compelling, thorough and pretty unputdownable account of one of the most interesting chapters in all sport, indeed all life.”49th over: India 174-3 (Kohli 49, Rahane 45) Anderson drops about three inches short and Rahane seizes on it, dancing back to play a classy steer for four through backward point. Sean Clayton joins the literary fray. “Beyond a Boundary is worth reading,” he reckons, “but I learned more from it about Caribbean culture and its 20th history than about cricket. My two favourite books about cricket, from rather different angles, are Mike Brearley’s ‘The Art Of Captaincy’ and ‘The Art Of Coarse Cricket’ by Spike Hughes, which is more a celebration of drunken villagecasual cricketing.” Not that drink and top-class cricket are total strangers, as we saw in the Stokes case.48th over: India 170-3 (Kohli 49, Rahane 41) Rashid regresses with an awful ball, a half-tracker, missing leg, which Kohli whips round to the fine-leg boundary. Root responds by taking out short leg, and the over goes for eight. “He’s got to have the courage to bowl at his speed,” Rob Key argues. “Not rush it.”47th over: India 162-3 (Kohli 42, Rahane 40) Kohli clips a single off the first ball from Anderson, leaving Rahane to face the dots. “I suppose it depends what you want from a cricketing book,” says Peter Rowntree. Can’t argue with that. “Undoubtedly the best-written cricket book ever written was A.G. McDonnell’s England, Their England. Which in terms of prose was the only cricketing book that I know that got onto the UK’s education reading list as recommended for A-level students. It has an account of a village cricket match, played down in Kent, which is considered a classic. The book covers a lot more than cricket, and if you enjoy a good laugh it is not only wonderfully written, but an extremely humorous account of British life in the 1930s.”46th over: India 161-3 (Kohli 41, Rahane 40) Again, a single and two from Rashid’s over. He has 4-0-21-0 and is warming to the task, trying a googly or two.“Two spring to mind,” says Andrew Thomas, talking about books. “Test Cricket by Tony Greig, which is a right riveting read.” My idea of heaven in 1975. “And The Thoughts of Trueman Now, by Fred Trueman, Eric Morecambe and Willie Rushton. An absolute delight including phrases such as ‘the thwack of leather on Brian Close’s head’ accompanied by an excellent Rushton cartoon of our Brian’s bald pate covered in round bruises.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/885c882b67c1d40fe9904d4d03c8593657e2924c/0_95_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10fde4d6a874868836cd65c22aa866b6","title":"uber judge steps aside","story":"The judge at the heart of tech giant Uber’s legal battle to operate in London has stepped aside to avoid any perceived conflict of interest.Emma Arbuthnot, the chief magistrate whose judgment reinstated Uber’s London licence after it was judged not a “fit and proper” private car hire operator, has withdrawn from hearing further appeals by the company after an Observer investigation raised questions into links between her husband’s work and the company.Lady Arbuthnot, who is married to senior Tory Lord Arbuthnot, approved a probationary 15-month licence for Uber to operate in the capital in June. Her ruling was a lifeline for the company, which in September had been told that Transport for London would not renew its licence. However, after the Observer highlighted her husband’s work for a strategy firm that has advised one of Uber’s largest investors, a spokesman for the judiciary confirmed that Arbuthnot would not hear Uber-related cases in the future. “The chief magistrate had been due to hear a licensing appeal by Uber in Brighton at a date yet to be fixed,” the spokesman said.“However, as soon as this link was pointed out to her, she assigned the case to a fellow judge. It is essential that judges not only are, but are seen to be, absolutely impartial.” The spokesman said it was the first time that such a connection had been brought to the chief magistrate’s attention.Lord Arbuthnot, a former Tory MP for Wanstead and Woodford, and then North East Hampshire, and chair of the defence select committee, was nominated for a peerage by David Cameron in 2015. He was until 31 December last year, three weeks after the start of Uber’s London appeal, a director of SC Strategy Ltd. Little is known about the private intelligence company, founded by Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, and Sir John Scarlett, the head of MI6 between 2004 and 2009. It has no website and eschews publicity.One of its few known clients has been the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the giant sovereign wealth fund that invests billions around the world.In December 2014, in a story that was not denied at the time by the QIA and was picked up globally by other media outlets, the Wall Street Journal reported that the fund was one of the main investors to have participated in a $1.2bn financing round for Uber.Although Arbuthnot stood down as a director of SC Strategy at the end of last year, his parliamentary website states that he remains a senior consultant to the firm, a remunerated position. Mick Rix, national officer with the GMB union which contested Uber’s London licence, said it had not known of the links between Lady Arbuthnot’s husband, SC Strategy and one of Uber’s largest shareholders.“GMB is surprised by the suggested connection between magistrate Arbuthnot’s husband and Uber,” Rix said. “Any matter which may be perceived as a conflict of interest is required to be drawn to the attention of the parties involved in any litigation at the outset.”The spokesman for the judiciary said the chief magistrate and her husband had been unaware that the QIA was an investor in Uber or had any links to it. The spokesman added: “The judiciary will have to consider whether the new information could be seen to change the perception of absolute impartiality.” Magistrates are bound by the Judicial Code of Conduct. It acknowledges that even the appearance of a possible conflict of interest may disqualify them. It ensures that a judge will be mindful of such possible conflicts and can draw relevant matters to the attention of the parties in the case. It states: “The question whether an appearance of bias or possible conflict of interest is sufficient to disqualify an officeholder from hearing a case is the subject of Strasbourg, English and Welsh and Commonwealth jurisprudence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12007a9d55bdcabfeff37f687e3bfc6eeb16d4bd/563_536_3287_1973/master/3287.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e83ac4671aeef136d00dfaf9dae145c","title":"the community space bringing scandinavian chic to glasgow","story":"For Fika Sake has become the centre of a thriving community in the heart of Scotland’s largest city, as part cafe, part learning space and lifestyle hubThe idea for an events space centred around coffee and cake was inspired by a place where so many good things originate – Scandinavia. Fika is the most recent Swedish tradition spreading across the globe. “It’s about taking time out of your day to actually sit down and maybe relax with someone or maybe yourself – usually over coffee and cake,” says Simon Forsythe, Glasgow-based owner of For Fika Sake.Forsythe’s space is part cafe, part community hangout and part creative workplace. Covering 185 sq m (2,000 sq ft) in the centre of Glasgow, For Fika Sake is drawing in everyone from students and freelancers to yogis and parenting groups who want to engage with other locals and like-minded people while learning something new.Forsythe brought the idea to life in January 2016, opening the doors after a year of planning. “It started when I was having fika at a cafe in town with a friend,” he says. “I was working a part-time job in a normal cafe and was fed up with that experience. She was running music workshops in Glasgow and wanted to work on a different project.” After bringing in one other partner, they came up with the name: For Fika Sake. “We thought up a funny, controversial title, a play on words and we stuck with that and went with it,” says Forsythe.The sense of community created by the cafe extends beyond its doors – the coffee, tea, and cake that give the space its name are sourced from local suppliers. On any day of the week you can walk into For Fika Sake to find people filling the space with music from an old piano donated by a local social enterprise, in pottery workshops run by local artists up on the mezzanine, discussing their latest reads during a book club, or catching up with friends.“It’s great to have this kind of community coming in and using the space for what it was originally designed for,” says Forsythe. “One in particular that stands out is the community for young parents. The big space means they can come in and store their prams in the corner and hang out with other parents and their babies.”After a challenging start, seeing the space come to life has been the big payoff for Forsythe. In December 2016, he had to take on the business himself after his two partners left to pursue other projects. “It was a bit of a shock,” he says. “But the business seems to have taken off since last January.” While he admits it was tough, particularly with the other stresses that come with starting a new small business – like big overheads – he says one of the perks to come out of it is being able to make decisions quickly and easily. “There was no compromise-with-partners involved, so I was able to get things done and out of the way,” he says.Now word of mouth has spread and the business is growing, and that quick decision-making is allowing Forsythe to try new ideas and systems to keep things running smoothly. He recently switched over to a new platform to help him get on top of his cashflow. He chose Square because he liked the “cool and simple” card machine – but also because he could access his funds the next working day.“It’s made a massive difference,” he says. “With this kind of business the most important thing for survival is cashflow, so being able to access your funds the next working day is a serious win. If it’s over the weekend you get your cash on Monday rather than Wednesday.”It’s also given him the time and freedom to focus on drumming up creative ideas for new workshops and events to help the cafe thrive. But if creating a community hub was the grand idea behind the space, it’s the cafe and fostering the tradition around fika that Forsythe reckons is the powerhouse of the enterprise. “It keeps the business going and it creates that space for people to use the workshop side of things,” he says.Using Square’s app, he can create a product button for a new kind of service on the spot – a convenience he appreciates, given the ever-changing use of the space and the introduction of new workshops and events. “Overall, it’s running nice and smoothly and going with that original plan, which is amazing to see.”Where does he see himself next? Hopefully with a second space, in a few years, although perhaps somewhere sunnier. “I’d love to see it grow and take on another premises in another part of Glasgow or potentially in another city,” he says. “But working on what we have right now and just gearing up more towards the community and growing it within this community is still number one.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd28f61c02f0eeb8892e587a59293fc76e8968f/0_0_5710_3426/master/5710.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ca13629e8308d22225c9ecbf734d997","title":"pembrokeshire coast beaches cafe skomer birds kayak","story":"The coastline of Pembrokeshire’s Marloes peninsula is glorious and uncrowded, the wildlife on nearby Skomer island is superb, and a new cafe on the way to both is the icing on the cake At Musselwick beach, the yellow sand, hemmed in by black slate cliffs, is an idyllic picnic spot, as we discovered after persuading our two scowling boys to walk the 20 minutes from Marloes village. They duly built acomplicated sand fort just in time for the tide to roll in and destroy it – the beach is only accessible for four hours a day, two either side of low tide.As we puffed back up the steps, we passed a dreadlocked fisherman in black neoprene, clutching a harpoon, with a serious-looking knife strapped to his thigh. He was in search of sea bass.Up the coast, the narrow cove at St Bride’s Haven is stony but sheltered, great for kids who want to swim, or practise sit-on-top kayaking and paddleboarding. There’s no hire place, but as it’s only a few metres from the free car park, it’s easy to bring your own. On an entirely different scale is mile-longMarloes Sands – well-used, with breakers for bodyboarders, but so vast it’s never crowded. Our most recent discovery, after over two decades of visiting this small peninsula in the Pembrokeshire Coast national park, is little-visited Albion beach. Named after a paddle steamer wrecked off this coast in 1837, it’s just north of Marloes Sands. We scrambled down a narrow path between gorse bushes to find waves crashing on to rocks, and not a footprint in the sand. With Cornwall hitting the headlines this week because of overcrowding, the chance to discover empty beaches makes this remote coastline even more appealing right now.Until this summer, anyone hauling themselves back up these cliffs, salt-stained and starving after a day on the beach, had to make do with a Mr Whippy from a van in the Marloes Sandscar park, or drive 15 minutes to The Griffin Inn in Dale. Marloes itself had just bog-standard pub nosh, and a sweet little cafe in the back room of the Village Stores.That has all changed with the arrival of chef Charlie Langrick and his partner Claire Pepperell, new tenants at a National Trustfarmhouse, where they have opened a cafe called Runwayskiln (10am-6pm, kitchen opens midday, closed Monday), with views to Marloes Sands and Skokholm island and on the way to Skomer island.The couple, who are west Wales natives, have updated this former youth hostel by transforming one of theblack-timbered barns into a cafe by day at night they offer dinner for groups of 10 or more. (They may open for breakfast and as a full restaurant in the evening next year, but check the website for updates.)Local artists’ work adorns the walls, and the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. Charlie, who has cheffed all over the world, says this National Trust tenancy has allowed him to realise his dream of a contemporary foodie destination in this far-flung corner of Wales. We ate superb pakoras, fresh hake and locally sourced crab fish cakes (mains from £8.50).Several of the local employees are on year-round contracts – Claire wants to keep people on in low as well as high season. It was a scramble to get the cafe ready for summer, so plans for bedroomsare on hold. Next spring, Runwayskiln will offer three rooms in the farmhouse – including a family room with double and bunk beds – with use of the kitchen and sitting rooms. More hostel-style accommodation will follow (until then try The Clock House in Marloes, doubles from £92 B\u0026ampB), or West Hook Farm Camping (from £15 for a car and tent for two). Next day, with Martin Leonard from Sea Kayak Guides, we paddled through the morning mist towards Skomer island, known for its bird life and managed by the Wildlife Trust. There is something magical about paddling through fog on a mirror-flat sea. The slap of our paddles and the whistle of wingsa few feet overhead were the only sounds. Gradually the island’s contours came into sight. A puffin skittered across the water, orange feet scuffing the surface, and headed to its burrow on the grassy cliff top. As the sun broke through, Skomer transformed from sludge greens and greys to blazing emerald topped with swathes of pink campions. On the rocks, cormorants stood drying their wings alongside black and white razorbills. Higher up the cliffs, guillemots screeched, keeping their single egg – or chick – safe on narrow ledges. Rafts of puffins bobbed on the water, some with a meal of silver sand eels in their orange beaks. Skomer’s puffin population is flourishing at the moment (the best time to see them is from April to July). It’s also good to know that these days it’s not just the puffins who stand a chance of decent food in these parts.• Dale Sailing operates cruises to Skomer (adult from £12, child £8, pembrokeshire-islands) until 30 SeptemberLooking for a holiday with a difference?

She was 76 years old. On Friday night, at landmarks like Cobo Hall and the Fox Theatre, marquees and billboards were lit up in her honor.Details of Franklin’s funeral were confirmed by her publicist, Gwendolyn Quinn. Public viewings will be held on 28 and 29 August at the Charles H Wright Museum of African American History, which held Rosa Parks’ viewing in 2005. The ceremony will be held on 31 August, with a service for family and friends at Greater Grace Temple. Franklin will be buried in Woodlawn cemetery, which holds members of her family.As the weekend drew on, Detroiters remembered a singer who changed the course of music but always embraced her often beleaguered hometown, when many others didn’t.At the Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts, a digital display read: “Forever Our Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, 1942-2018.” Franklin’s final performance in the city was there, last year. At the Made in Detroit restaurant downtown, a newer star plastered a message on his marquee: “Sending lots of love and prayers for Aretha. All of my respect – Kid Rock.”On Friday night, the museum held a tribute concert as part of its 36th annual African world festival, with performances by local musicians. Franklin’s longtime choreographer, Lisa McCall, and several dancers dressed in white and closed the night with a performance set to Franklin’s gospel classic, Mary Don’t You Weep.“I need the skies to just hold off,” McCall said, as rainclouds gathered. “We are going to speak to you through our movements.”The Museum has opened each day since Franklin’s death by playing her music. It will hold a gospel celebration on Sunday. For Njia Kai, director of the African world festival, Franklin was simply part of growing up in Detroit.“We respected her talent and consciousness,” she said, “and how she kept it real – she maintained that while also bringing an understanding to the level of celebrity that she had acquired. A lot of people gain their stardom and there’s no connection back to their neighborhood or where they grew up. It wasn’t like that with her.”The city’s professional sports teams also honored “Ree Ree”, as she was known locally. On Friday night, the Detroit Lions football team made an announcement before their preseason opener at Ford Field. The city and the world had “lost a true superstar”, it said. Franklin performed at Ford Field on Thanksgiving Day in 2016, singing The Star-Spangled Banner.The Detroit Tigers baseball team were away in Minneapolis, but they walked on to the field to Franklin’s most well-known and loved hit: R-E-S-P-E-C-T.In the city’s North End, a display of flowers, teddy bears and balloons grew in the doorway of New Bethel Baptist church, which Franklin’s father led from 1946 to 1979. Aretha sang gospel there, her singing career and spiritual life beginning.One note attached to a bouquet of red roses thanked Franklin for sharing her voice and “showing us how to be strong and persevere”.Less than two miles away, mourners gathered where Berry Gordy founded the internationally beloved Motown record label in 1959. It is now the Motown Museum. In the broad pages of a guestbook left just outside the entrance, visitors from Massachusetts, Maryland, Florida, Virginia, Canada, Uganda and New Zealand had left their condolences and signed their names.Franklin did record at United Sound Systems (USS), which was planning to open on Sunday for the public to walk through, listen to her music and look at evocative photos. “We’re welcoming whoever shows up,” a representative said.Established in 1939, USS was one of Detroit’s first independent recording studios. In 1985, Franklin worked there with the Eurythmics and the Rolling Stones.Carleton Gholz, founder of the Detroit Sound Conservancy, which helped get a historical marker for the studio, sent a bouquet.“It’s an important, secular place to honor Aretha,” he said. “Detroit was the center of the 20th century in so many ways, and Aretha is a part of that. It’s very affirming that we were the place she came back to.”In south-west Detroit at the El Club, an all-ages arts venue, patrons celebrated Franklin’s life with Chicago DJ WhoDat and Brad Hales, proprietor of Detroit-based Peoples Records. El Club founder Graeme Flegenheimer organized the evening and would donate all proceeds to MusiCares, a foundation for musicians experiencing financial, personal or medical crisis, including drug rehabilitation.“She was one of the few artists that hadn’t left Detroit,” said Flegenheimer, adding that he was a recovering addict and had friends who received direct assistance from MusiCares. “I think when people pass away who have had such a significant impact on people’s lives, you have to pay your respects. And I wanted to do right by her.”As midnight loomed, commemorations and celebrations were still going strong. PedalUp Riderz, a cycling group, organized a “Friday Night Groove”. Dozens of riders made stops at the museum, the Baptist church and the house in which Franklin grew up, on the west side. They blasted unforgettable hits such as You Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman) and stopped to hear each other speak. “Thank you queen, for your sacrifices,” one rider said. “Thank you for your love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e124545220be0c0d715c34447b63cc4e53c5d744/200_0_2699_1620/master/2699.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abe75721d08f94cc20ffc4ae731d962","title":"new york governor andrew cuomo america never that great","story":"Cuomo tries to walk back remark he admitted was ‘inartful’ and which drew fire from Republicans including TrumpThe New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who many believe is eyeing a White House run in 2020, has continued his attempts to walk back a controversial statement: that America “was never that great”.“I want to be very clear,” Cuomo said on Friday in a call with reporters. “Of course America is great and of course America has always been great.”His original phrasing, he said, had been “inartful”.Cuomo made the offending remark on Wednesday, at the end of a speech focused on his opposition to Donald Trump and delivered to an audience gathered to witness the signing of a bill introducing new penalties for sex trafficking.Riffing on Trump’s famous campaign slogan, the governor said: “We’re not going to make America great again – it was never that great.”To gasps and laughter, he continued: “We have not reached greatness. We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.”The president quickly joined a chorus of criticism from state Republicans, some of whom offered to buy Cuomo a bus ticket to Montreal.But the damage was done, the comment etched into Cuomo’s political biography, an error that reminded some of the day Cuomo’s father, Mario, famously baulked at running for the presidency himself. Stephen Colbert, host of The Late Show on CBS and a fierce critic of Trump, said it was “the dumbest thing you could say as a politician”.On Monday, Trump told a rally for Claudia Tenney, a Republican representative in Utica, New York, that Cuomo “called me and he said, ‘I’ll never run for president against you.’ But maybe he wants to.”The president then urged Cuomo to run.“Oh, please do it,” he said. “Maybe he means it. But one thing we know, and they do say: anybody who runs against Trump suffers.”The president continued to ridicule Cuomo on Friday, comparing the comment to Hillary Clinton’s use of the word “deplorables” to describe Trump supporters during the 2016 election. In that campaign, Democrats including Barack Obama also riffed on the “Make America Great Again” slogan, although they chose to tell audiences America “was already great”.“I say Andrew’s was a bigger and more incompetent blunder,” Trump tweeted. “He should easily win his race against a Super Liberal Actress, but his political career is over!” Trump was referring to Cuomo’s primary challenger, Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon. Trailing by 33 points in the latest RealClear poll, she told NY1 the governor was “trying to figure out what a progressive sounds like and missing by a mile”.Cuomo continued to tweet retorts, accusing Trump of “hiding behind tweets” and, with reference to immigration policy, “ripping babies from their mothers’ arms”.

But one thing about the wedding of the Austrian foreign minister, Karin Kneissl, stood out: among the guests was the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.The exact details of Putin’s controversial “private” visit weren’t confirmed until the last minute, when his private plane touched down at the tiny Graz regional airport early yesterday afternoon. The airport was briefly closed to passengers and sealed off by a large police presence supported by Austria’s elite Cobra taskforce.Putin’s party then travelled in a convoy of black vans to the Tscheppe restaurant, known for its Backhendl chicken, and boasting a terrace overlooking a mountain vineyard in the picturesque Alpine state of Styria.Television pictures showed Kneissl, 53, who had arrived earlier together with her groom, businessman Wolfgang Meilinger, accepting a bunch of flowers from Putin at the gate. And the two politicians then shared a dance – witnessed by the only photographer granted access to the ceremony.Putin’s entourage included the choir, which serenaded the couple and their guests, among them Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz of the conservative Austrian People’s party and vice chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache from the far-right Freedom party (FPÖ). The Russian president left a short time afterwards, rushing off to Berlin for wide-ranging bilateral talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel.Kneissl, an independent, owes her appointment as foreign minister to the populist, anti-immigrant FPÖ, the junior party in Austria’s ruling coalition. A polyglot who speaks seven languages including Arabic and Hebrew, she was previously known as a journalist and Middle East analyst who made frequent appearances on Austrian broadcaster ORF and in recent years shifted to the right.Putin’s attendance at her wedding drew anger from opponents who said it undermined the EU’s stance against Russia over Ukraine. For Kneissl to invite “the most aggressive foreign adversary of the EU” to a private celebration was “completely unacceptable”, Austrian Green MEP Michel Reimon said last week, calling for her resignation.Kneissl’s display of warmth to Putin also prompted outrage in Kiev, and sparked calls for Austria to withdraw from the EU Commission’s efforts to mediate an end to the frozen conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east.“It goes without saying: if you invite Vladimir Putin to your wedding, you are not neutral any more,” tweeted Ukrainian MP and foreign affairs committee member Hanna Hopko. “From now on, Austria can’t be a mediator in Ukraine. Period.”In a later Facebook post Hopko demanded Russia be held to account for the Skripal nerve agent attack in the UK, the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 and alleged war crimes in Aleppo, Syria.The Austrian government said Putin attended as “a personal guest”. Foreign ministry spokesman Matthias Forenbacher said: “No change will result in terms of Austria’s foreign policy position.”Kneissl first met the Russian president 17 years ago at a summit in Slovenia with the then US President George Bush in July 2001. A self-proclaimed “conservative free spirit,” she belongs to no party and has proved a isive figure since her appointment to Austria’s rightwing coalition cabinet last December.Kneissl’s scepticism over Austria’s acceptance of refugees from the Middle East won applause from the FPÖ and gained her the foreign ministry when the populists rose to power last December. Kneissl has sharply criticised the EU’s handling of Brexit and Catalonia’s drive for independence and poured scorn on Angela Merkel’s open-door migration policy, which she has called “grossly negligent”.Putin’s attendance at the wedding could be taken as a slight in Berlin, where Merkel had dampened expectations for Saturday’s “working meeting,” the first time the leaders had met since a fractious summit in Sochi in May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/169d747f1b9a585ff9feaceb7ea3f7ba07cd1363/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f8907d9e4781faeee60bc57969323fb","title":"french teenagers swipe up for arts electronic culture pass emmanuel macron","story":"It’s like Tinder but for the arts, and with benefits. Your phone shows you a picture teasingly described as likely to “arouse desire” – of a play, a film, a concert, a book, an instrument, a dance class – that is on, or available, in your neighbourhood.If it’s not for you, swipe left and the app serves up an alternative. If it is, swipe up to get more details, reserve a ticket or buy your copy. The bonus: if this is the year of your 18th birthday, it comes preloaded with €500 of culture credit.Four hundred young people in five départements are currently testing the technicalities of France’s new culture pass, which fulfils a campaign promise by President Emmanuel Macron to improve popular (and particularly youth) access to a broad range of cultural events, activities and goods.From late October, according to the culture ministry, which is running the €430m-a-year scheme, 10,000 young people will start using the app in real time in a six-month trial. The scheme is set to be rolled out nationally for all from next spring.There have also been warnings that it risks running into the same problems as the “bonus cultura”, a similar scheme introduced in Italy in 2016 by the then prime minister, Matteo Renzi, which local media have reported was widely abused. Italian students not much inspired by the arts reportedly auctioned off their passes to the highest bidder on social media, while unscrupulous retailers exchanged culture credits for electronic items such as tablets, laptops and games consoles while ringing up the sales as weighty art books.France’s culture minister, Françoise Nyssen, said last month the French pass would involve “no cultural snobbism ... No cultural or artistic offering will be excluded. Every organisation active in the cultural arena will be welcome on the pass – public or private, physical or virtual.”But leading cultural figures have asked whether the French government should really be offering teenagers free tickets for Hollywood blockbusters, such as the latest episode in the Star Wars franchise. “All young people can go and see this kind of movie,” Richard Brunel, director of the national drama centre in Valence, told Le Monde. “It’s not necessary for it to be available on the pass.”Others disagree. “Culture in France is stuck in a kind of aristocracy,” said Fabrice de Boni, director of a successful web TV series. “Star Wars absolutely should be part of the culture pass’s offering.”If that argument appears to have been settled (Hollywood is popular culture and will be represented in all its guises, the culture ministry insists, and it will be up to independent and arthouse cinemas to find ways to use the app effectively), there will nonetheless be some “editorialising”.In principle, offers could range from a ticket for a Comédie Française performance to a week-long water-colour painting course, a school book on a cultural theme, a subscription to a major online music service, six weeks of hip-hop classes or even a critically applauded video game.But the algorithm is likely to lean towards public sector, independent and local offerings rather than content produced by Netflix or Spotify. It will also, unlike those companies’ apps, promote ersity of cultural experience rather than recommend similar products based on recent behaviour.Nyssen has also said she intends to set limits – yet to be defined – for certain kinds of expenditure on the app to ensure 18-year-olds do not spend all their credit on subscriptions to US streaming platforms. (Practical cultural activities will not be restricted, allowing young people to blow their €500 on drum lessons if they choose).“We will be asking for an extra effort from the very big players,” said Frédéric Jousset, a senior member of the project’s management team. “There’s no way this is going to turn into some sort of motorway for the digital majors.”While many have welcomed the scheme’s potential to expand the cultural horizons of France’s youth, it has plenty of critics, including the late Socialist president François Mitterrand’s influential former culture minister, Jack Lang. In an interview with French public radio, Lang said he was “not convinced” by the project as it stood. “In Italy, it was above all pure entertainment that benefited. Young people have not really been elevated culturally.”Lang said arts policy should be built on creativity. “We have to have confidence in arts organisations: when you see opera opening up to young people, museums almost becoming schools ... We should be encouraging them to open their doors wide, not promoting a sort of cultural consumerism.”Stéphane Troussel, a Socialist party politician in the northern Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis, where the app is being tested, also had his doubts. “Culture is a powerful mechanism for reducing inequalities,” he told Libération. “But it has to be accompanied. For the popular classes, access to culture is not just a financial issue. There needs to be some form of mediation, of preparation. It can’t just be a publicity announcement.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e8b95251ebe3dc89cac546ae4c1cc4d76ab924a/0_112_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f728153027b0b5adae46feb466d00111","title":"hajj nap pods being introduced for pilgrims to saudi arabia","story":"The sleep stations – based on Japan’s famous capsule hotels – will offer clean sheets and air-conditioning Saudi Arabia plans to introduce sleep pods, reminiscent of Japan’s famed capsule hotels, in the western city of Mina in the coming days, as an estimated two million Muslims gather for the six-day hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam.The free pods are part of new measures being rolled out this year in a bid to modernise the centuries-old practice of hajj.The government has also introduced apps for on-the-spot translation and emergency medical care.A Saudi charity, the Haji and Mutamer Gift Charitable Association, is offering between 18 and 24 capsules for pilgrims to nap in for free in the coming days.Each fibreglass pod – less than three metres long and just over one metre high – features a mattress, clean sheets, air conditioning and a large, well-lit mirror.The pods can be lined up horizontally or stacked vertically to save on space.Each napper will have three hours so sleep in the pods, which are imported from Japan at cost of around $1,114 each.When the pilgrim wakes for prayer time – five times daily in Islam – workers will sterilise the pod before handing it over to the next pilgrim.“We believe it’s extremely well-suited for crowded places in our holy sites and in Mecca,” Amer said.But for hajj, which takes pilgrims across Mecca and Mina – cities in western Saudi Arabia home to the holiest sites of Islam - the pods were also inspired by the rising popularity of car and bike-sharing.“The capsules work through a share economy, like bicycles that you can rent for an hour and then leave for someone else,” said Amer.A trial run of 12 pods earlier this year was, he said, a success. Amer estimates 60 people used each pod every day during the fasting month of Ramadan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace12e6d6d25130f1551a1bc99813fd88d232150/0_13_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ded830ff9eb8fb0dc433a2ecae048f2","title":"kofi annan tributes un leader outstanding human being","story":"Tributes poured in from around the world for Kofi Annan, the first sub-Saharan African to lead the United Nations, whose work revitalising the organisation and putting human rights at the core of its mission was recognised with a Nobel peace prize.In a rare moment of unity, leaders around the globe and across the spectrum, from Tony Blair to Vladimir Putin, remembered his charisma, commitment and diplomatic gifts.In his home country, Ghana, president Nana Akufo-Addo said flags would fly at half-mast for a week in mourning to honour “one of our greatest compatriots”.“He excelled in the various undertakings of his life, leaving in his trail most pleasant memories. His was a life well-lived,” Akufo-Addo said on Twitter.Annan died aged 80 after a brief illness, with his wife and children by his side. “Wherever there was suffering or need, he reached out and touched many people with his deep compassion and empathy,” the Kofi Annan Foundation said, confirming the death.He spearheaded the global fight against HIVAids while in office and after leaving, and championed the millennium goals, the targets that became a focus for improving health and education worldwide.South Africa’s Archbishop Desmond Tutu described his death as a “devastating loss”. Annan was an “outstanding human being who represented our continent and the world with enormous graciousness‚ integrity and distinction”, said Tutu.He was admired but also much loved, said Frederic Eckhard, Annan’s spokesman and adviser for more than a decade, and the loss will be felt personally by many who worked with him. “You always felt on his team that you were working for something worthwhile.”“Kofi had an interesting combination of traits, he was reserved and disciplined on the one hand, and on the other he could be kind of playful,” Eckhard said. “He handled things so calmly and with such assurance. He had an enormous amount of charm and terrific political instinct.”Others paying tribute included Tony Blair, once an adversary over the Iraq war. Annan declared the US and UK-led attack illegal and described the UN’s inability to stop that conflict as his “darkest moment”.The former British prime minister said: “He was a good friend whom I saw only weeks ago. Kofi Annan was a great diplomat, a true statesman and a wonderful colleague.”Annan’s legacy is not entirely unblemished. As head of peacekeeping operations before leading the UN, he was in charge when genocide engulfed Rwanda and when thousands of Muslims were killed in the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia.He was haunted by regret that the UN did not do more to stop these tragedies, which drove his later sense of mission. The painful memories “influenced much of my thinking, and many of my actions, as secretary-general”, he would say years later. He also made scathing internal UN reports public.But after the cold war, Annan fought successfully to renew the UN’s sense of purpose, and carve out a role as a moral compass for a new world.Prime minister Theresa May said Annan helped make “the world he has left a better place than the one he was born into.” Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn praised his work building a “more just and peaceful world”.Annan’s last public mission was to Zimbabwe before bitterly contested elections. Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa praised him as, “a rare breed of diplomat soft-spoken but unshakeably firm … Go well son of Africa, champion of the world!”Russia’s Vladimir Putin praised his leadership skills. “I sincerely admired his wisdom and courage, his ability to make informed decisions even in the most complex, critical situations.”Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif shared a picture of him with Annan on Twitter, describing him as “a towering global leader and an unwavering champion for peace, justice and rule of law. Rest in peace my dear old friend.”Eckhart remembered, overall, a leader who had focused on hope and optimism, for the world, and for himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f026815a0f4decd59ce89e5496021ffb75311887/0_55_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9b6f1564ab660c513a8c1df76d2575c","title":"tesla ontario sue electric car rebate scheme","story":"The Canadian arm of Tesla Motors is taking Ontario’s new Conservative government to court, claiming it has suffered “substantial harm” after the cancellation of a rebate programme for residents who bought electric vehicles.Since taking power earlier this year, the new government – led by Doug Ford, the brother of the former, late Toronto mayor Rob Ford – has killed off several initiatives ushered in by previous Liberal governments, from a pilot exploring basic income to a hike in the minimum price of beer.Included in this was the end of a carbon pricing policy that sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Canada’s most populous province. The move would also end a range of environmental initiatives funded by the programme, including rebates of up to C$14,000 ($10,700) for residents who bought electric vehicles.To the soften the blow, the government announced a transition period rebates would be honoured for anyone who bought electric vehicles through a dealership, as long as the vehicles are registered and delivered by 10 September.In an application for judicial review filed earlier this month, Tesla Motors Canada claimed this stipulation unfairly singled the company out, as it sells vehicles directly to customers rather than through dealerships.“The Minister of Transportation’s decision suddenly left hundreds of Tesla Canada’s Ontario customers in the unfair position of no longer being eligible for the rebate they had expected to receive when they ordered their vehicles,” the lawsuit claimed. It noted that those who purchased other brands of vehicles can still receive a rebate.The lawsuit asks the province’s superior court to quash what is described as an “arbitrary and entirely unreasonable” decision.“The decision has already inflicted substantial harm on Tesla Canada in the form of lost sales and the creation of an impression among Ontarians that Tesla Canada may be singled out for future arbitrary treatment under the law,” the lawsuit noted.None of the company’s claims have been proven in court.A spokesperson for Ontario’s transportation ministry said that it was aware of the lawsuit but declined to comment, noting that the matter is before the court."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Suspect arrested after narcotics valued at \u0026euro64,000 found along with cash and cannabisMet \u0026Eacuteireann warns of short, intense bursts of rainfall with added hazard of spot floodingPlaque mounted recalling ultimate sacrifice of celebrated chaplain Fr Willie Doyle SJCardinal Donald Wuerl was to give a keynote address on families at RDS on WednesdayDepartment considered it inappropriate to ask former minister about Gmail accountFormer president describes reading reports from Pennsylvania as \u0026lsquolike a horror show\u0026rsquoCivil rights activist says she has \u0026lsquorun out of patience\u0026rsquo with \u0026lsquothat house on the hill\u0026rsquoO\u0026rsquoCallaghan reveals devastation at diagnosis of \u0026lsquoprogressive and sadly incurable\u0026rsquo diseaseIrish Government had asked the DUP leader to attend the pontiff\u0026rsquos speech in Dublin CastleAbout 270 workers engaged in industrial action over union representationActivists who occupied a vacant house in Dublin city say they are not vigilantesLotto price is to increase for the second time since the franchise was privatisedJust under 80,000 students to discover if application successful for third-level placeThere was little health and safety during previous visit, and no airportHope and a handcart fuelling cycle to east by faithful fans from BallygarPrelate, due in Dublin this week, is criticised in a damning US reportCouncil secures vacant possession of 50-year-old dilapidated complexFianna F\u0026aacuteil deputy leader also calls for Fine Gael to be \u0026lsquohonest\u0026rsquo about its failures"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

I’m having to have special shoes made for me because Strictly didn’t have any big enough.”Kate Silverton leaving BBC studios on Friday eveningThe presenter, who is 5ft 10in, was introduced to a selection of Strictly’s costumes earlier this week. She said having two children in her 40s has not knocked her confidence as she prepares to compete for the glitterball trophy.“At 14, I was already a shoe size eight and, while my school friends delighted in wearing the latest styles, I was still in Clarks Classics or — horror of horrors — boys\u0027 shoes,” she said.“Earlier this week, I tried on a costume. It was very short,  like wearing a swimsuit. When I put it on I thought: ‘This is how I am. This is how I look. Embrace it.’“I\u0027m 48. I\u0027ve had two children in my 40s. My body has actually served me really well.\u0027”But despite her confidence, Silverton still has a couple of caveats for her professional dance partner, who is yet to be announced.She said: “You ask, \u0027Why Strictly?\u0027 Why not Strictly? I love music. I love dancing with the children in the kitchen.Alijaz Skorjanec and Gemma Atkinson on the last season of Strictly“He\u0027s got an element of fun, but equally he will teach me, and there\u0027s going to be a lot to learn.“Let\u0027s say the benchmark is quite low. Whoever I dance with has to be taller, wider and have bigger feet.”It is not the first time Silverton, best known for regularly presenting the BBC’s one, six and ten o’clock news bulletins, has been approached for Strictly.She was offered a position in 2006 and again 2009, but said her personal life, including her struggle to have children, meant the moment was not right.“Where I am right now, everything has come together,” she said.Both Silverton’s children, Clemency, six, and Wilbur, four, were conceived naturally after five failed IVF attempts.The average shoe size of British women is six and only six percent are a size eight or above, according to the British Footwear Association.A BBC spokesperson said:  Our wonderful wardrobe team are creating a pair of custom-made dance shoes to fit Kate’s size 9 feet, which should give her all the support she needs to look amazing on the dancefloor.Churchill\u0026#39s earliest foe was his German tutorBuilding thousands of new homes on \u0026#39historically priceless\u0026#39 D-Day heroes airfield is an \u0026#39insult\u0026#39, campaigners sayComment: The BBC still thinks we should appease Iran’s dictators, but Iranians themselves are protestingComment: This government is leaving rural voters prey to violent criminalsComment: Look, we’re sorry about our apologies running late...The slow fall of Ghazni: how the Taliban took over an Afghan city Comment: An Amazon tax won\u0026#39t save the high street.

We wouldn’t walk down Normandy in France and expect to see a load of brand new houses built there, somewhere so significant, so I don’t see why it should happen here.“It is an important monument to the airman who helped us in our darkest hour and it should be preserved for future generations.”The airfield, which was the first of 14 US airfields built in England in the early 1940s, is now private land and has been put up for development by its owners.it was home to the 322d Bomb Group who attacked coastal defences on D DayIt has been an active flying school since 1973 and its manager, Mike Rowland, said the American pilots who lived and worked in Andrewsfield “certainly left their mark” on the area.He said: “The American pilots who used to live and work here would often come back and sign a plaque we have in the main reception. Most of them have passed away now, but still their children come to sign the plaque. As the generations move on, we have recently started getting their great grandchildren visiting too.“Andrewsfield is such a big part of the local community and is very historically significant.”A spokeswoman for the North Essex Garden Communities said: The North Essex Garden Community proposals are subject to approval through the local planning processes which the councils are currently undertaking.“The exact location of housing and other aspects of any new community will be subject to consultation. We are committed to ensuring that local people help us to shape all areas of the new community including Andrewsfield.”The landowners insisted that the developments won’t impact the “historical” aspect of the site, adding: “There’s very little of the original airfield actually left and the area has been scouted for housing since the 1960s.”Galliard Homes, the property developers on the project, were approached for comment.BBC\u0026#39s Kate Silverton: \u0026#39Strictly had to make special shoes for my big feet\u0026#39Churchill\u0026#39s earliest foe was his German tutorComment: The BBC still thinks we should appease Iran’s dictators, but Iranians themselves are protestingComment: This government is leaving rural voters prey to violent criminalsComment: Look, we’re sorry about our apologies running late...The slow fall of Ghazni: how the Taliban took over an Afghan city Comment: An Amazon tax won\u0026#39t save the high street.

The Office for Students is\u0026nbspclosely monitoring the number being issued and we fully expect it as the regulator to take appropriate action.”Speaking to The Independent\u0026nbspabout unconditional offers ahead of results day, Michael Barber, chair of the Office for Students, said: “Some universities seem to be lowering the tariff because they are worried about not recruiting enough students.“I think the sector\u0026nbspneeds to think about this very hard.”A-level results 2018 – in picturesStudents celebrate their A Level results from Ark Academy in WembleyCharlie Jenner,

accepted onto courses was down 1 per cent compared with the same point in 2017.However, the proportion of 18-year-olds being accepted on to courses broke records.In an exclusive interview with The Independent earlier this year, Ucas boss Clare Marchant called for an urgent rethink on universities using unconditional offers across the board.Universities minister Sam Gyimah has previously branded the rise in unconditional offers as “irresponsible” and has warned that the practice could undermine the credibility of the system.And on Thursday, Mr Hinds said he was “concerned” about the rate of growth in these offers.Department for EducationEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full

one another with regularity’Click to followThe Independent OnlineThe book centres on the samurai game 100 candles, where each storyteller must spin a tale to surviveThe kitchen is always a potential crime scene. A kitchen contains any number of lethal weapons. Knives, skewers, frying pans, chopping boards. Generally only deployed to inflict pain on radishes, cucumbers, and dead animals. But the possibility, the likelihood, of violence is there.Which is a fact that the late Anthony Bourdain – star of Parts Unknown, but who rejected the label of “celebrity chef” – has exploited in a now posthumous graphic novel, Hungry Ghosts, and a previous bestseller, Get Jiro!Bourdain’s long-time collaborator, Joel Rose, discovered (and was discovered by)\u0026nbspBourdain in the 1980s. Rose, noir novelist and author of Kill Kill Faster Faster, was then founder and editor of a magazine that captured the zeitgeist – and has since been acquired by museums like the Guggenheim, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney – Between C and D.The C and D in question were the Avenues C and D on the East Side of New York, in between which Rose lived. “Back in 1982,” Rose recalls when I visit\u0026nbsphim in New York, “I had a book contract and I bought a computer to do the job.” It had a dot matrix printer attached, an Epson QX-10, running a Valdocs program.\u0026nbsp“When it printed out the clatter of it\u0026nbspmade me think of Gutenberg, sort of historic, but revolutionary.” Rose realised that he could print a magazine in this way if he could find writers to fill the continuous sheet, folded over upon itself, with holes down each side. “I drew on the cover myself, put it in a plastic bag the way the drug dealers did with dope, and left copies at a few book stores, St Mark’s and East Side Books.” Miraculously, the new format magazine was an overnight hit.Copies sold out. Epson donated more printers and they had five or six printers going day and night and they still couldn’t keep up. Artists and writers rushed to contribute. Including one young wannabe, Anthony Bourdain, who submitted\u0026nbsp20 pages of a comic book that he had written and drawn.Bourdain first showed Rose his work, he said: ‘The drawing sucked but the writing was good’ (Hungry Ghosts)“I liked his writing,” Rose says. “I wrote back to him and told him the drawing sucked but the writing was good.” A week later, the apartment buzzer goes, and a tall good-looking guy with dark hair is standing at the door, in his chef whites. It’s Bourdain. He’s turned up in person. “We were friends from that time on,” says Rose. “He used to say I was the only real writer he knew.”Bourdain’s first ever published story appeared in Between C and D in 1985, in the volume 2, no 1 issue. Bourdain didn’t like to call himself a chef, he preferred to say cook. Chef was too hifalutin. Bourdain and Rose had a lot in common. They had both started out at the bottom as dishwashers.Good food, good eating, is all about blood and organs, cruelty and decayRose’s father had been a waiter and Bourdain\u0026nbsphad worked as a waiter himself, as well as a busboy, so he’d lived and worked in restaurants around New York. Bourdain grew up in New Jersey, his mother worked at The New York Times and his father was a music executive, but he developed a passion for cooking after eating an oyster on a French fishing boat, studied at the Culinary Institute of America, and rose through the ranks to become head chef at the Brasserie Les Halles, a French-style restaurant in the financial district, serving up escargots, foie gras and steak tartare.But at the same time, he always wanted to be a writer. While working as a chef by night, he wrote by day and published a couple of mysteries, Gone Bamboo and Bone in The Throat. “But he was still unsure of himself, he wasn’t confident about his writing,” says Rose.Anthony Bourdain: Celebrity chef in picturesAnthony Bourdain with Nigella Lawson and Ludo Lefebvre in Channel 4\u0027s \u0027The Taste\u0027Anthony Bourdain winning Outstanding Informational Series Or Special at the 2016 Creative Arts Emmy AwardsBourdain\u0027s no-holds-barred account of life in American kitchens is both a memoir and an insider\u0027s guide to the tricks of the trade.58 Chefs Anthony Bourdain (L) and Mario Batali take a selfieChefs Anthony Bourdain (L) and Mario Batali take a selfieBourdain and Danny Bowien at \u0027The Mind Of A Chef\u0027 Premiere Launch Party88 Anthony Bourdain and Joel Rose return for the follow up to their bestseller Get Jiro!

Anthony Bourdain, and Joel Rose (Kill The Poor) return for the follow-up to their #1 New York Times bestseller Get Jiro! Then, in 1998, Les Halles sent him to Tokyo to open a Japanese branch. He would send Rose regular emails about his adventures in Japan. There was one in which he described his visit to a local fish market. “It was so good I printed it out and took it in to show Karen.”Karen Rinaldi, an editor at Bloomsbury, was Joel’s wife. She happened to be breastfeeding their first child, Rocco, at the time. She had her hands full. “So I read it out to her,” says Rose.\u0026nbspShe looked\u0026nbspup and said:\u0026nbsp“Does he have any other stories like that?”“Loads,” he said.She put\u0026nbspthe kid down and picked up the phone and called\u0026nbspBourdain’s agent and straight off made an offer on the book. “What book?” said the agent. Because it didn’t\u0026nbspyet exist. She just bet\u0026nbspthat it will. It was a good guess.That book became Kitchen Confidential:\u0026nbspAdventures in the Culinary Underbelly, published in 2000, combining memoir and an insider’s exposé of the cons, vices and sins of the New York restaurant scene, hymning “the dreamers, the crackpots, the refugees and the sociopaths” of the kitchen.Bourdain was outspoken about his drug use. He had acquired a heroin and cocaine habit and he said he needed it to survive the rigours and stresses of his trade. He was funny, but in a raw, wounded, vulnerable kind of way. The book became a huge hit. The core of it was published as an essay in The New Yorker, called Don’t Eat Before Reading This. This is how it begins:\u0026nbsp“Good food, good eating, is all about blood and organs, cruelty and decay. It’s about sodium-loaded pork fat, stinky triple-cream cheeses, the tender thymus glands and distended livers of young animals. It’s about danger – risking the dark, bacterial forces of beef, chicken, cheese, and shellfish.”Bourdain’s sense of violence in the kitchen (Hungry Ghosts)Bourdain does not bother to conceal the dark side of haute cuisine and speaks of “humiliation, injury, fatigue, and the threat of illness”. He adds:\u0026nbsp“Gastronomy is the science of pain.” Little wonder then that “there is a powerful strain of criminality in the industry”. According to Bourdain the leading civilian occupation of prison inmates in the US, before they were locked up, was cook.Thinking that the life-giving side of food had to be balanced by death, he was always a carnivore to his bones and reserved a corner in hell for vegetarians: “Serious cooks regard these members of the dining public – and their Hezbollah-like splinter faction, the vegans – as enemies of everything that’s good and decent in the human spirit.“To live life without veal or chicken stock, fish cheeks, sausages, cheese, or organ meats is treasonous.” He liked to squirt blood into his mouth from a spicy boudin noir. He praised ribs, hooves, organs, tripe, trotters. Bourdain liked the element of risk in food. In one of his shows in far-flung parts he sampled cobra heart and soft-boiled duck embryo. He was even an outspoken fan of cream and butter.The essay and the book changed his life forever. His writing took him out of the kitchen and put him on the road. “What if I go to the places I love – Vietnam for example, or Morocco – and write about the cooking there?” he suggested to Rinaldi. Thus were born the subsequent A Cook’s Tour: In Search of the Perfect Meal and its sequel, A Cook’s Tour: Global Adventures in Extreme Cuisines. At a certain point a production company called him up and asked if they could tag along and film his journey. His charm and honesty and, to a degree, his profanity, made the shows as big a success as the books.“He married his high school sweetheart,” says Rose. “But she couldn’t understand what he was doing, ultimately couldn’t stand it.” His second marriage was to Ottavia Busia, the hostess of a French restaurant, Le Bernardin, where they were introduced by the chef, Eric Ripert, whom Rose describes as Bourdain’s “idol”. Together they had a daughter, Ariane, now aged 11.Bourdain had started with a comic book and he’d always wanted to do a graphic novel. One Thanksgiving he went over to Joel Rose’s place, cornered him, and announced:\u0026nbsp“I’ve got a great idea.” The idea for Get Jiro! came from Bourdain’s sense of violence in the kitchen. He wrote that, “Since we work in close quarters, and so many blunt and sharp objects are at hand, you’d think that cooks would kill one another with regularity.” In Get Jiro! – and the prequel Blood and Sushi – they do.Serious cooks regard these members of the dining public – and their Hezbollah-like splinter faction, the vegans – as enemies of everything that’s good and decent in the human spiritA Japanese chef – a dab hand with sushi and knives – comes to a near-future LA and is caught in the middle of a culinary war. Bourdain and Rose worked up a few pages and sent it to an editor at DC Comics. It turned into a New York Times\u0026nbspno\u0026nbsp1 bestseller. “It outsold Superman,” Rose says.Hungry Ghosts is based on a samurai tradition, going back to the Edo period, of telling tales in the night frightening enough to put fear into the hearts of warriors. A hundred candles would be lit but with each tale another candle would be snuffed out and so the stories became progressively darker. “We just changed samurai to chefs,” says Rose.The book is a thing of beauty, but the stories are filled with images of death and destruction. Knives and axes feature prominently. Decapitation and amputation abound. Eating but also being eaten. These are horror stories with recipes.Bourdain was most famous for his ‘Parts Unkown’ series, but he rejected the label of celebrity chef (Alamy)When he hanged himself in a hotel room in northeast France, aged 61, Bourdain was on location, filming a new episode of Parts Unknown. His friends were shocked and mystified. “I thought he was happy,” says Rose. “He was happy. He told the film director how happy he was to be working on the comics. He carved out the perfect life for himself.” But he also had a long habit of referring to suicide and depression.Perhaps, as some have suggested, Bourdain was simply exhausted by a gruelling schedule. Rose suggests that he may have been too self-critical, set himself impossible standards. “He valued integrity so high. Maybe too high.”These were Anthony Bourdain\u0027s three tips to making the perfect burgerAnthony Bourdain death: No narcotics found in system when he diedAnthony Bourdain\u0027s former New York City apartment for rent for £11,000Anthony Bourdain reveals how he pictured Harvey Weinstein\u0027s deathAnthony Bourdain leaves fortune to 11-year-old daughterFor all his worldly success, Anthony Bourdain always thought of himself as an outsider. It’s why he spent so much of his time on the road, always looking for a home he could never find. He wrote:\u0026nbsp“In America, the professional kitchen is the last refuge of the misfit.” Even in the spotlight, he felt isolated. He once described his lifestyle as “crushingly lonely”.One thing that emerges from his books and television shows is that, as Rose puts it, “He always made sure to be nice to people”. But in the end there were “so many people” that needed him, were dependent on him. He was drained by it all. It may be the fate of the most popular cook to feel as though he is being eaten up by others. Carved up and served on a plate. Not for vegetarians. In the story, Bourdain and Rose imagine the Snow Woman,\u0026nbspa ghostly figure who is capable of sucking the life right out of you: “her kiss is like that of the vampire”. Another story features the Jikiniki who are “devourers of human flesh”. Bourdain was self-deprecating enough to feel he didn’t deserve his success. He once said:\u0026nbsp“I should’ve died in my twenties. I became successful in my forties. I became a dad in my fifties. I feel like I’ve stolen a car – a really nice car – and I keep looking in the rearview mirror for the flashing lights – but there’s been nothing yet.” Joel Rose, in a metaphor which Bourdain would have appreciated, said: “He thought he was like the rat who stole the cheese off the table.”‘Hungry Ghosts’ (Dark Horse Comics, £12.50) is out 2 OctoberEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6463721  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 1984  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg","title":"madonna 60 pop stars middle age patti smith kate bush","story":"Created with Sketch.In most\u0026nbspprofessions,\u0026nbspwomen of a certain age are invisible.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/01/21/russian-ship-chase.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/01/21/russian-ship-chase.jpg","title":"hms queen elizabeth porsmouth us donald trmp royal navy ship","story":"Created with Sketch.Warship\u0026nbspwill first dock in New York and\u0026nbsptrial landing F-35B fast jets on deck for the first timeClick to followThe Independent OnlineHMS Queen Elizabeth leaves Portsmouth for historic US trip, amid rumours of potential Trump visit“Having the aircraft carriers maintains our credibility, without the aircraft carriers it would dilute it. Not to have an aircraft carrier at sea, to denude yourself of them, would be a folly,” declared Captain Jerry Kyd.“We remain an island nation with obligations. For national security reasons it is essential\u0026nbspwe have to maintain a strong capability.”The commanding officer of HMS Queen Elizabeth was speaking on the bridge of the aircraft carrier as she prepared to depart from Portsmouth for America\u0026nbspand trials to land F-35B fast jets on deck for the first time, the final crucial preparations as the 65,000 tonne ship comes into service.The carrier will dock first in New York and there are rumours that Donald Trump will come on board, which may be consolation for him after the military parade he ordered was postponed by the Pentagon with costs climbing to $92m\u0026nbsp(£69.5m).Captain Kyd did not know whether the presidential visit will happen.\u0026nbsp“I wish he would,” he said before going on to\u0026nbsppoint out why, in his view, the Queen Elizabeth and her sister carrier HMS Prince of Wales were imperative for Britain in the face of Russian aggression, Chinese expansion and\u0026nbspthe unpredictability about North Korea’s nuclear programme.The Kremlin, he believes, is\u0026nbspthe most immediate threat. “Without these two ships I think we would be struggling to remain credible as a first-class sea power,”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspthe Captain said\u0026nbsp to a group of journalists.\u0026nbsp“The increase in Russian submarine activity has been frightening, it has been quite eye-watering what we have seen over the past two years.“We have seen a huge increase in Russian activity in the maritime area we need to respond to that.\u0026amppound650m Navy warship arrives in Portsmouth“When you see how active as Russia has been you have to recognise that they do not spend all that money and do all this activity just for a laugh.”But it is the money spent on the Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales –\u0026nbsp£6.2bn – while the defence budget is being slashed across the board, which has led to fierce criticism, some of it coming from the military.For General Lord Richards, the former head of the Armed Forces the programme\u0026nbsp is having a “huge distorting effect” on the defence budget. “Now we have the carriers we have to make them work” he acknowledged, “but you make them work at the expense of the rest of the Navy, the RA, and the Army”.Lord Richards, who\u0026nbsphad been an opponent of the carrier programme when he was Chief of Defence Staff, rejects the notion that the two ships would project the UK back into being a major military power able to take part in far flung conflicts on, for example, the China Seas or off the Korean peninsula.“For Britain, with its Army of 78,000 and its Navy of 20 frigates and destroyers, to have the conceit to think it can fight a war in the Far East is almost laughable,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Our practical role should be confined to Nato, Africa and the Middle East. We lost all other capability not just in the recent cuts, but in the cuts in the early 90s, at the end of the Cold War.”Major General Jonathan Shaw, who was in charge of the SAS as Director of Special Forces, also points to the problem caused by cost of the carriers.“Most of the tasks they would perform can be done through cheaper alternative means. The cost has imbalanced the budget . The Army made its cuts two years ago, but it’s still suffering because of the carriers, it has also had a damaging effect on the Navy as well”, he stated.Some critics of the carriers can barely contain themselves in the vituperation of their disapproval.Max Hastings, the military historian and commentator wrote: “I have compared these boats to the ancient Egyptian pyramids: they have consumed immense resources while possessing almost zero utility.“At least the pyramids are amazing to look at I doubt in years to come a single tourist will visit Portsmouth to see the QE rotting at its moorings.\u0026nbspIf I sound intemperate, it is because many people who care passionately about Britain’s defences have been warning for years that the carriers would prove a disaster.”The criticism is refuted by the supporters of the carriers. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “ HMS Queen Elizabeth is a true statement of our national power and the whole country can be proud to see this magnificent symbol of our engineering prowess and international ambition leaving port to sail onto the world stage.China launches its first home-built aircraft carrierWreck of Second World War aircraft carrier found after 76 yearsUS Navy aircraft carrier visits Vietnam in a warning to ChinaLeak discovered on new £3.1bn aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth“Her voyage to America not only shows her global reach, but strengthens our special relationship with the US Forces who have worked hand-in-hand on this iconic programme.”Commodore Andrew Betton, commander of UK Carrier Strike Group also wanted to stress the “iconic” nature of programme.“These first F-35B embarked trials in a UK aircraft carrier are not only key to future operational success but represent an iconic moment for the modern Royal Navy”, he said.“At the heart of our Maritime Task Group, the aircraft carrier is well protected and sustained, ready to operate around the world as a potent and exceptionally flexible instrument of our foreign policy.”As the media departed the Queen Elizabeth, Captain Kyd warned: “No negative stories please, otherwise we’ll come and bomb you!”There will probably be no need for that but a ceasefire from the critics of the carrier programme remains unlikely in the near future.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/18/14/cannes.jpg","title":"uber british passengers france french riviera cannes","story":"Created with Sketch.‘If I wasn’t in a fit and able state we would all be 100 per cent\u0026nbspdead,’\u0026nbspsaid Londoner who escaped the sinking vehicle\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineUber refunded victims after initially charging for traumatic rideTwo Londoners\u0026nbspmade a lucky escape from a sinking Uber car after it was driven off the end of a jetty and into the sea\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspCannes.Nick Christoforou, 31, managed to open the car door underwater and pull his friend Sophia Toon, 23, to safety following the traumatic e in the water off the French Riviera coastline.The Uber driver, who was breathalysed and found to be sober, also wriggled free of his vehicle and swam back to the surface.Uber narrows losses but fails to turn a profit, dampening IPO hopesMan knocks on New York car window, dies after driver punches himAmish man offers ‘Uber’ rides in horse and cartLondon taxi drivers could sue Uber for £1.25bn over lost earnings“If I wasn’t in a fit and able state we would all be 100 per cent\u0026nbspdead,” said Mr Christoforou, a real estate employee from north London.Mr Christoforou and Ms Toon were on a work-related trip in Cannes when the incident took place.Despite the pair’s ordeal, the ride hailing app reportedly still charged them £18 for the trip, although the fare has since been refunded.Uber has banned the driver from picking up any more fares via the popular app.“One minute I was in the back of an Uber heading home, and the next I was in the sea,” Mr Christoforou told The Sun.“All of a sudden I felt falling.

That is why my trade union, Community, is backing\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Final Say\u0026nbspcampaign, to secure a people’s vote on the final deal.”Contribute to the march of a generationAt the last People’s Vote March in June, well over 100,000 people marched on parliament.Community’s roots are in textile manufacturing and the steel industry – pushed to the brink of collapse in recent years as much larger economies such as China distort international markets.In 2018 the industry has faced new pressure in particular from steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump’s US administration, which Brexiteers are relying on for a favourable future trade deal.Community also supports prison and justice workers, logistics, finance, politics and public affairs staff, the charity and freelance sectors and is affiliated to the Labour\u0026nbspParty.Mr Rickhuss highlighted London School of Economics data concluding Brexit was already costing the average UK household more than £404 a year by June 2017.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline

“profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table“If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table, including reopening negotiations with Europe and retaining the status quo.“Community would not shy away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote launched in April demanding a referendum on the deal agreed with the EU\u0026nbspand has a grassroots network of around 1 million people, holding rallies and action days across the country.The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign three weeks ago,\u0026nbspso far gathering 615,000 names to its petition along with a string of political endorsements.In June this year more than 100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in Brexit negotiations?No-deal Brexit ‘will raise risk of disease outbreaks’Why has John McDonnell’s constituency changed its mind on Brexit?Senior Conservative asks constituents if they want new Brexit voteIt received backing from British film star Dominic West today, who said: “Please sign the petition, join us on our march, and let’s get a people’s vote to say that we won’t be dictated to.”The gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new referendum, said: “This Tory government, unfortunately assisted by the Labour Party,\u0026nbspthreaten to harm young people’s futures.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“That’s why students across the country are coming together for the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future. Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure

USAlex Jones is being sued by the families of nine Sandy Hook victims for spreading false claims that the 2012 elementary school shooting was a government-backed hoax Lawyers for the families of two Sandy Hook shooting victims are accusing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars media business of intentionally destroying evidence relevant to the defamation cases against him, according to a motion filed on Friday in a Texas court.Mr Jones is being sued by the families of nine Sandy Hook victims for spreading false claims that the 2012 shooting at the elementary school that killed 20 first-graders and six adults was a government-backed hoax, and that the families of the dead were actors.Mr Jones said on his broadcast last week that he had told his staff to delete material after CNN cited Infowars content that violated Twitter’s policies, according to the motion filed Friday.Mr Jones has been protesting an unprecedented effort this month by Apple, Facebook, YouTube and other services to remove Infowars content from their platforms.At least some of the deleted content was considered evidence in the Sandy Hook cases, and Mr Jones had been informed in writing in April that he was obligated by law to preserve all relevant material, according to the court filing in District Court in Travis County in Austin, Texas.“As pressure mounted from pending defamation lawsuits and growing public indignation, Mr Jones chose to destroy evidence of his actual malice and defamatory conduct,” the motion filed on Friday said.Scenes of shock and devastation at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, ConnecticutPicture from local newspaper the Newtown Bee shows Connecticut State Police lead children from the Sandy Hook Elementary SchoolThe scene outside the primary

Elementary School in Newtown, ConnecticutPicture from local newspaper the Newtown Bee shows Connecticut State Police lead children from the Sandy Hook Elementary SchoolThe scene outside the primary school following the incidentConcerned parents picking up their children following the shootingObama wipes away a tear during the press conferenceThe suit said that it was not known how much content had been deleted, but that it included written social media materials and videos.The motion was filed on behalf of Neil Heslin, father of Jesse Lewis, a 6-year-old killed at Sandy Hook.Over the five years since the shooting, families of the Sandy Hook victims have been stalked, threatened and subjected to online abuse by Jones’ followers, after he spread false claims about the mass shooting, calling it “synthetic, completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured,” according to documents.Friday’s motion is the latest legal salvo in three separate defamation lawsuits filed by Sandy Hook families, which seek tens of millions of dollars in damages and pose an existential threat to Mr Jones’ business.Should the court find that Mr Jones and Infowars willfully destroyed evidence, he, and possibly his lawyer, could be assessed fines and be subject to punitive action.Most importantly, the material that was destroyed could be presumed by the court as supporting Mr Heslin’s claims against Mr Jones, bolstering his case.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log

rotating leadership between the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) and the Pakistan People’s Party, punctuated by military rule.A tearful Mr Khan, dressed in a traditional black sherwani, promised to “bear true faith and allegiance”, and to “discharge my duties and perform my functions honestly, to the best of my ability... and always in the interest of the sovereignty, integrity, solidarity, wellbeing and prosperity of Pakistan”.The 65-year-old – who became a national hero after captaining Pakistan to world cup victory in 1992 – had won a confidence vote in the National Assembly the previous day.His taking up of office follows\u0026nbspvictory in the country’s July election in which his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party promised to end corruption and build an “Islamic welfare state”.At Saturday’s ceremony,he was joined by members of that 1992 world\u0026nbspcup winning team, including fast bowler Wasim Akram.Another cricketer-turned-politician, India’s Navjot Singh Sidhu, was seated in the front row. In a sign that relations between the two countries may improve under Mr Khan, he was seen warmly embracing Pakistan’s\u0026nbsparmy chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa.Mr Khan’s third wife Bushra Bibi, formerly known as Bushra Maneka,\u0026nbspwas also present, making her first public appearance since the couple married earlier this year. She was covered from head to toe in a white niqab.His first wife, the London heiress Jemima Goldsmith – who he maintains a good relationship with – was not in attendance. Neither were the couple’s two sons. “The boys really wanted to be there but their father told them not to come,” Ms Goldsmith tweeted.She has been one of her ex-husband’s biggest supporters, previously tweeting: “22 years later, after humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices, my sons’ father is Pakistan’s next PM. It’s an incredible lesson in tenacity, belief\u0026nbsp\u0026amp refusal to accept defeat. The challenge now is to remember why he entered politics in the 1st place.”After the swearing in ceremony, the new leader went to the prime minister’s house in the capital\u0026nbspwhere he was given\u0026nbspa guard of honour.But the challenges now facing Mr Khan are myriad.\u0026nbspNo prime minister of Pakistan has ever completed a full five year term, and he will have to contend with the same issue as many of his predecessors: how to maintain a power balance in civil-military relations.Dealing with militant extremism, water shortages, a rapidly growing population and a potential looming economic crisis are among the immediate issues awaiting Mr Khan.World news in picturesMuslim pilgrims walk out after the Friday prayer at the Grand mosque ahead of annual Haj pilgrimage in the holy city of Mecca, Saudi ArabiaA man wades through flooded water in Kochi, Kerala state, India.

For many women and their partners, a miscarriage means the loss of a baby and the hopes and the dreams for that child,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“It would give people the time out you need when you have been bereaved.

He later rescinded the claimOn 1 August, 2017, an unresolvable dispute within the bitcoin community saw the network split. The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe initiative raises new questions about the legality of Moroccan administered infrastructure projects in the area, Sara Eyckmans, coordinator for Western Sahara Resource Watch (WSRW), said in a statement.\u0026nbspParts of Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, were annexed by neighbouring Morocco in 1975 in a move not recognised by the international community.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe mostly desert territory is home to just 500,000 people and has been subject to physical and political clashes between Rabat and the Polisario independence movement ever since. \u0026nbspMorocco, which imports more than 90 per cent of its energy requirements and is home to a youthful and growing population, is in desperate need of ersifying its energy sources. High electricity and other utility prices have driven protesters to the streets en masse several times since major Arab Spring protests in 2011.The Rabat authorities have built several wind energy projects in Western Sahara so far, although several UN and European Court of Justice rulings have said that Sahrawis should have full control of development of the area’s natural resources.\u0026nbspWSRW has urged Brookstone and Soluna Technologies to support the UN peace process by cancelling the Dakhla\u0026nbspproject. Its backers told Forbes\u0026nbspthey are aware of the “political sensitivities of the region” and that the investments respect Western Sahara’s international legal status.\u0026nbspThe Soluna project brings benefits for local Sahrawis as well as Rabat, Mr Belizaire said.\u0026nbspIt will create more than 1,000 high tech jobs in Dakhla and the company also plans to reinvest one per cent of the site’s revenue into local educational programmes, creating “a community of trained resources in blockchain computing and launch a centre of excellence in the region”, he added.\u0026nbspConstruction of the new wind farm and computing centre begins next year and should be connected to Morocco’s national grid in the next five years.\u0026nbspSoluna is investing $100m\u0026nbsp(£79m) into the site’s initial phase, which it hopes will generate 36 megawatts of electricity, and will then seek additional input from private equity and large institutional investors. \u0026nbspMoroccan officials\u0026nbspdid not immediately respond to requests for comment for this article.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/18/11/egyptian-agriculture.jpg","title":"old cheese egypt tomb ancient history curse ptahmes memphis","story":"Created with Sketch.Ancient cheese was\u0026nbspincluded in the feasts buried alongside wealthy Egyptians and\u0026nbspprobably had similar\u0026nbspconsistency to\u0026nbspgoats cheeseClick to followThe Independent Online The mysterious white substance discovered in a group of broken jars could be one of the oldest solid specimens of cheese ever foundA few years ago, a team of archaeologists cleaning sand from an ancient Egyptian tomb discovered a group of broken jars, one of them containing a mysterious white substance.A new analysis published in the journal Analytical Chemistry suggests that what\u0026nbspthey found during that excavation was an approximately 3,200-year-old piece of cheese, one of the oldest solid specimens discovered.“The archaeologists suspected it was food, according to the conservation method and the position of the finding inside the tomb, but we discovered it was cheese after the first tests,” Enrico Greco, the lead author of the paper and a research assistant at Peking University in Beijing, said in an email.The tomb in which the cheese was found belonged to Ptahmes, a high-ranking Egyptian official in the 13th century BC\u0026nbspand the former mayor of the ancient city of Memphis, according to the paper.His burial site was first unearthed in 1885, but was lost to shifting sands until its rediscovery in 2010.The ancient cheese, which was sometimes included in the feasts buried alongside wealthy Egyptians, was probably similar in consistency to chevre, or goats cheese, but with a “really, really acidy” bite, according to Paul Kindstedt, a professor at the University of Vermont who studies the chemistry and history of cheese.“It would be high in moisture, it would be spreadable,” he said. “It would not last long, it would spoil very quickly.”Black sarcophagus found in Egypt is finally openedEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesAnd while the sample retrieved by Mr Greco’s colleagues may be old, others have discovered traces of ancient cheese or yoghurt (the two can be difficult to distinguish) that long predate even the recent finding, Mr\u0026nbspKindstedt said.“Other groups have done a lot of work with extracting lipid residues, fat residues, from ancient pots going back as far as 7000 BC,” he said.In 1942, a team of researchers reported a finding not dissimilar to that of Mr Greco and his colleagues, Mr Kindstedt pointed out.In a journal article, they described finding a substance in ancient Egyptian jars that they suspected to be cheese dating back to 3200 BC. The samples, they wrote, had “no smell and only a dusty taste.”But even if the cheese Mr Greco tested isn’t the oldest ever found, the findings stand out for another reason: the application of a state-of-the-art protein analysis.“As I say to my students every year when I get to Egypt, someone has to go ahead and analyse these residues with modern capabilities,” said Mr Kindstedt, who added that he plans to use Mr Greco’s paper in his teachings this autumn. “This is a logical next step and I think you’re going to see a lot more of this.”In their analysis, Mr Greco and his colleagues found hundreds of peptides, or chains of amino acids. Most were human and represented skin and saliva contamination, but, crucially, nine were linked to bovine or ovine milk.Adventurous eaters be warned: The cheese may not be cursed, but the analysis found evidence of a bacteria that causes brucellosis, an infectious disease that can cause fevers, headaches, muscle pain and other symptoms that can reoccur or never go away at all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/15/senator.jpg","title":"australian senator fraser anning final solution muslim immigration","story":"Created with Sketch.Crossbencher Fraser Anning widely condemned for his isive remarksClick to followIndy PoliticsAn Australian politician has provoked outrage after using the term “final solution” in an incendiary\u0026nbspspeech about immigration, in which he called for a plebiscite asking voters whether they want to stop\u0026nbspMuslims and those “from the third world” from entering the country.Queensland senator Fraser Anning’s provocative maiden speech called for an immigration program that favours “European Christian” values, claiming it would protect Australia from potential terror attacks.We as a nation are entitled to insist that those who are allowed to come here predominantly reflect the historic European-Christian composition of Australian society, the Katter’s Australian Party upper house MP said.Trump isn’t the only one whose immigration policy is doomed to failLaura Ingraham defends her immigration comments, disavows David DukeIf Trump got his way, Melania\u0027s parents would be illegal immigrantsMr Anning, who replaced Malcolm Roberts in the Senate back in June, called for “a plebiscite to allow the Australian people to decide whether they want wholesale non-English speaking immigrants from the third world, and particularly whether they want any Muslims”.“The majority of Muslims in Australia of working age do not work and exist on welfare. Muslims in New South Wales and Victoria are three times more likely than other groups to be convicted of crimes, he claimed.\u0026nbsp“We have black African Muslim gangs terrorising Melbourne, we have Isis-sympathising Muslims trying to go overseas to try and fight for Isis and while all Muslims are not terrorists, certainly all terrorists these days are Muslims.“So why would anyone want to bring more of them here?”He went on to state\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspmigrates should learn the English language and embrace Australian values.“Ethnocultural ersity ... has been allowed to rise to dangerous levels in many suburbs, he said.In direct response, self-segregation, including white flight from poorer inner-urban areas, has become the norm.World news in picturesMuslim pilgrims walk out after the Friday prayer at the Grand mosque ahead of annual Haj pilgrimage in the holy city of Mecca, Saudi ArabiaA man wades through flooded water in Kochi, Kerala state, India.

OnlineA Myanmar border guard policeman patrols along the border between Myanmar and Bangladesh in Rakhine state, June 2018The US\u0026nbspTreasury Department has\u0026nbspimposed sanctions on three Myanmar military commanders,\u0026nbspa border guard police commander and\u0026nbsptwo entire military units for their involvement in “ethnic cleansing” against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state.It was the firmest US\u0026nbspaction yet against the Myanmar military since it launched a brutal campaign against the minority group almost a year ago.The move comes as the US\u0026nbspState Department readies a comprehensive report on atrocities in Rakhine state last August.The study could include findings on whether the military committed crimes against humanity or genocide against the Rohingya.Human rights groups and experts have accused the military in Myanmar, also known as Burma, of waging a premeditated campaign against the Rohingya, disputing its explanation that it was merely responding to militant attacks on police posts.The army’s weeks-long clearance operation in Rakhine state resulted in allegations of rape, indiscriminate killing and the torching of Rohingya homes.The three Myanmar military commanders, Aung Kyaw Zaw, Khin Maung Soe and Khin Hlaing, and the border guard police commander, San Lwin, were sanctioned for their roles in leading campaigns against ethnic minority communities, the Treasury Department said in a news release.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya refugees are reflected in rain water along an embankment next to paddy fields after fleeing from

military has “used many of the same tactics against a number of other ethnic and religious minority groups,” the department said, citing “extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and torture against civilians”.Khin Hlaing was specifically sanctioned for his role in Shan state, in the country’s north, against ethnic Kachin and Chinese minorities.The Treasury Department also sanctioned two entire military units – the 99th and 33rd light infantry isions – in a rare move. Both units were designated for “engaging in serious human rights abuse”, the department said.Soldiers of the 33rd Light Infantry Division participated in last August’s campaign against the Rohingya and were accused of firing on fleeing villagers and raping women.“Treasury is sanctioning units and leaders overseeing this horrific behavior as part of a broader US\u0026nbspgovernment strategy to hold accountable those responsible for such wide-scale human suffering,” said Sigal Mandelker, treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.“The US\u0026nbspgovernment is committed to ensuring that Burmese military units and leaders reckon with and put a stop to these brutal acts,” he added.Several people familiar with the matter, who were not authorised to speak publicly, said that the\u0026nbspTreasury Department\u0026nbsphas had the names of Myanmar military commanders responsible for actions against the Rohingya\u0026nbspfor months.But the US has been slower than other Western nations to respond to the atrocities while it determines the most appropriate foreign policy response.Washington has been weighing the risk that sanctions or tougher actions against Myanmar would push the country closer to China, its neighbour to the north.World news in picturesMuslim pilgrims walk out after the Friday prayer at the Grand mosque ahead of annual Haj pilgrimage in the holy city of Mecca, Saudi ArabiaA man wades through flooded water in Kochi, Kerala state, India.

ambassador says ‘destroying Rohingya exceeds costs’ for MyanmarRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report allegesMatthew Smith, who leads the advocacy group Fortify Rights, said Friday’s announcement was a “welcomed and useful start”.Fortify Rights recently published a report charging that the Myanmar military’s actions in Rakhine were the result of deliberate and meticulous planning.“Certain members of Congress who want to protect Suu Kyi should understand that there’s no alternative to holding perpetrators accountable in the face of genocide and mass atrocities,” he said.“Military impunity is one of Myanmar’s most significant problems, and Suu Kyi stands in the way of fixing it.”Fortify Rights, Amnesty International and other rights groups argue that sanctions must include the commander in chief of Myanmar’s military, Min Aung Hlaing.“Responsibility extends to the highest levels of the chain of command – so, too, should justice and accountability,” said Francisco Bencosme, Asia-Pacific advocacy manager at Amnesty International.“That includes Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, commander in chief of the Myanmar military.”Others, however, have argued that sanctions – which block their targets’ assets in the US\u0026nbspand prevent American businesses from working with them – will not harm the Myanmar’s army, which has few US\u0026nbspholdings.“Sanctions will not affect the military,” said a former high-ranking Myanmar army official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.He argued that punitive actions, including prosecution at the International Criminal Court, would only harden its position.“If you push the military too hard, they will behave in a much more extreme way – and then China will be very happy,” he added.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community

Life on Mars could be found within THREE YEARS astrobiologist saysSince the discovery of the first exoplanet in 1992, scientists have concluded that many of the 4,000 confirmed or candidate exoplanets discovered so far fall can be ided into two categories: those with the planetary radius averaging around 1.5 that of the Earth, and those averaging around 2.5 times the radius of the Earth.Unveiled his exciting research, Dr Zeng pointed to findings which suggested the proportion of water on many exoplanets appeared to dwarf that of the Earth, where it makes up just 0.02 percent of the mass of the planet.He admitted: \u0026ldquoIt was a huge surprise to realise that there must be so many water-worlds.He and his colleagues analysed exoplanets with mass and radius measurements from the Gaia satellite in order to develop a model of their internal structure.Swathes of exoplanets are likely to contain vast amounts of water, the study suggests (Image: NASA)Scientists analysed data from the Kepler space telescope (Image: )This indicates that exoplanets which have a radius of about 1.5 times the size of the Earth, which are five times the mass of our own, tend to be rocky planets, while those with a radius 2.5 times the size of Earth, and 10 times the mass, are likely to be water worlds.Dr Zeng added: \u0026ldquoThis is water, but not as commonly found here on Earth.\u0026ldquoTheir surface temperature is expected to be in the 200 to 500 degree Celsius range.Their surface may be shrouded in a water-vapor-dominated atmosphere, with a liquid water layer underneath.

The next generation space telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, will hopefully characterise the atmosphere of some of them.\u0026ldquoThis is an exciting time for those interested in these remote worlds.Professor Sara Seager, Professor of Planetary Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and deputy science director of the recently-launched TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos amazing to think that the enigmatic intermediate-size exoplanets could be water worlds with vast amounts of water.\u0026ldquoHopefully atmosphere observations in the future \u0026ndash of thick steam atmospheres \u0026ndash can support or refute the new findings.Earlier this month Dr Airapetian said the discovery of the Mars lake, coupled with a separate study suggesting fluctuations in the levels of methane in its atmosphere which could be caused by biological processes, were \u0026ldquoexciting.He added: I agree that within next 3-4 years we can witness new evidence from Mars that will excite us with the interesting and surprising possibilities of microbial life forming in harsh conditions of this planet.

But short-break destinations like Ireland are most vulnerable, so it is important that we continue to invest in Great Britain.\u0026ldquoThey are very much our biggest volume market.However, Spain is also concerned about the possible impact on one of its largest industries.Fears that Brexit will affect tourism are voiced by Spanish regions such the Balearic Islands, including Mallorca, a popular destination for British package holidays.

Regional officials have warned a sudden withdrawal without a free trade agreement of goods and services could ruin their businesses.Irish hauliers have also warned new shipping routes and extra checks will result in agri-food deliveries perishing because of the longer transport times.Italy\u0027s farmers are also concerned that any restriction in free trade between the Italy and the UK would devastate their industry.Roberto Moncalvo, president of Italian farming union Coldiretti said the UK\u0026rsquos exit from the EU in March 2019 would \u0026ldquoweaken Italy\u0026rsquos farming industry and export trade.He warned Italian agriculture \u0026ldquocan\u0026rsquot pay the price of Brexit.They fear an estimated cut of \u0026euro2.7billion (\u0026pound2.3billion) to the budget of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), something which could heavily impact 800,000 Italian farms.

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have debt distress.”Pohiva said with China debt becoming so prolific, it was no longer a problem to be dealt with individually. He added: “I think these small countries will eventually come together to find a way out.”China defended its lending practices, saying they were sincere and unselfish, and insisting it only lent to countries that could repay.Tonga is one among a list of South Pacific countries that have taken on debt in recent years.Sydney’s Lowy Institute think tank, which has closely monitored China’s activities in the Pacific, estimates Beijing has poured nearly £1.4billion into Pacific countries since 2006.Other big debtors include Papua New Guinea, which owes roughly £498million in development and aid debt, Fiji, which owes £496million, and Samoa, with debt of £181million."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427246727.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds oldest cheese found in egyptian tomb and its older than jesus","story":"The solidified whitish substance was found in an ancient jar and was made from a mixture of cow milk along that of a sheep or goat.In a study published this week, scientists say they have discovered that probably the most ancient archaeological solid residue of cheese ever found”.The cheese was buried in the 19th dynasty tomb of the Ptahmes, mayor of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis.The sample was wrapped with a canvas into a broken jar, said lead author Enrico Greco, from Italys University of Catania, told the ABC.The archaeologists suspected it was a kind of food left for the owner of the tomb and they decided to ask for chemical analyses.There are several examples in mural paintings with barter scenes where cheese was represented and certainly it was used in the Egyptian medicine during the Ptolemaic period.But until now we were not sure whether it was really part of the daily life of the ancient Egyptians.The team are, however, not sure what the ancient cheese tasted like.We do not have much information on what the taste could be, we know it was made mostly from sheeps and goats milk, but for me its really hard to imagine a specific flavour, Dr Greco said.Im Italian, I love cheese and I know how much they can change in flavour and appearance even with very few differences in ingredients and process.The cheese sample was excavated at the Saqqara necropolis near Cairo between 2013 and 2014.The findings were published in the journal Analytical Chemistry this week.Scientists also found cheese contained bacteria potentially causing the deadly disease brucellosis, caught by eating unpasteurized dairy products.If confirmed, it would be the first biomolecular direct evidence of the diseases existence during the pharaonic period, according to the study."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004254419541.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"indonesia earthquake sumbawa latest news","story":"Tremors were felt in nearby Bali.Indonesias Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said in a tweet there was no tsunami risk.The latest quake is the fourth to hit the south east Asian country in recent weeks that have left at least 460 dead.A massive 6.9 quake initially struck the island of Lombok which was followed by one measuring 6.4 on July 29.The epicentre of todays quake was around 500km from the island of Lombok which is still reeling from the impact of two deadly tremors and dozens of aftershocks. The vast quake struck two miles south east of Loloan in the north east of the island, at a depth of around 19 miles.Then on August 9 a third, measuring 6.2, struck.The Indonesian government reports that more than 1,400 people were injured and more than 156,000 have been displaced.Thousands of people have been left homeless and are in desperate need of food, medical care and shelter.Celebs including Take That star Gary Barlow, model Chrissy Teigen and David and Victoria Beckham were among the thousands of tourists caught up in horror scenes on the idyllic Indonesian islands when the first quake hit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427250158.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rare jumping spider uk first six feet","story":"The crafty creepy crawlie -

claiming it would make them more loyal to Jeremy Corbyn.Mr Williamson, the MP for Derby North, is in the middle of a two-month tour of England speaking to local branches of hard-left pressure group Momentum.At every meeting hes been drumming up support for mandatory reselection - which would give local Labour activists an iron-clad veto over whether their MPs are allowed to stand for re-election.Speaking in Plymouth last week, he said that reselection would stop a repeat of the 2016 coup against Mr Corbyn by centrist MPs who tried to replace him with Owen Smith.Mr Williamson said: Why are people so fearful of democracy? If youre doing a good job, if youre responsive to your members, then youre going to get reselected, arent you?If youre not, if youre railing against your leader, if you are disregarding your members, then members might take a different view.He added: It leads to a coup where the leader has got the biggest political mandate of any leader in this country, theres an attempt by the Westminster elites to kick him out.If people were concerned about the possibility of maybe losing their nomination through an open selection, it might just concentrate their minds a bit.The veteran leftist insisted the purpose of his democracy roadshow wasnt to campaign for deselections - but went on to name four of moderate MPs hed like to see gone.Mr Williamson said: Theres a few people I would like to see deselected - but its not up to me.I mean, if it was theyd be gone tomorrow, in fact theyd be gone yesterday. But its up to the members in each and every constituency.He continued: Im not suggesting theres going to be wholesale deselections - its not a deselection tour, contrary to what some people are saying about it or trying to characterise it as.Even though we are going to people like Chuka Umunnas seat, and Chris Leslies, and Neil Coyles, and Wes Streetings constituency.The four MPs named are all fierce critics of Mr Corbyn who have recently savaged his stance on Brexit.Mr Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, mocked Mr Williamson and suggested he was just trying to curry favour with the Labour leadership.He told The Sun: Chris should spend less time trying to get a job in the Shadow Cabinet and more time in his own Derby constituency where the Tories have been doing well in his absence.Mr Williamson quit as shadow fire minister in January after repeatedly calling for Mr Corbyn to enact even more extreme left-wing policies.And he has repeatedly stood up for leftie activists whove been thrown out of Labour following anti-Semitism claims."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000159739694-e1534531485294.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"madonna best at being madge","story":"She might have had a bit of assistance to retain such a fresh-faced youthfulness, but the body is all her own work.Through hours of  gym graft and sheer willpower she’s even more bendy now than when she first burst on to the scene back in 1984 warbling Holiday in a Minnie Mouse falsetto.Madonna is the biggest-selling female artist ever, shifting 300million albums and is worth around 454million quid.She’s achieved success on her own terms and been a trailblazer for every other successful female act following in her wake. There would be no Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus or arguably Lady Gaga without Madonna.She might not be the best singer or dancer in the world, but she’s certainly the best at just being Madonna.You simply can’t imagine anyone ever telling her what to do. She’d laugh in their face.Madonna had always known how to grab attention, whether it’s publishing a book stuffed full of naked photos of herself, faking self-pleasure on stage, or kissing Britney Spears.And only Madonna could have bounced back from almost being strangled by her bright red Armani cape when she took a tumble and fell on her backside during the Brit Awards three years ago.She merely dusted herself down and carried on regardless, but I bet whoever was in charge of her wardrobe that night would have been given the b******ing of their life.Madonna is always in charge, professionally and personally. Even during her brief fling with aging lothario Warren Beatty, he was very much a bit player in the Madonna Show.That must have badly bruised the ego of a man who had always had the upper-hand in his relationships until then.It has to be said her love life hasn’t been anywhere near as successful as her career.There was a brief, destructive marriage to American actor Sean Penn in the Eighties and in 2000 she married Guy Ritchie, but the couple divorced eight years later.Since then she has dated a string of handsome and often young men, but they usually seemed to have the whiff of a photo opportunity about them rather than anything long term.She chews them up, spits them out and moves on to the next one.Madonna seems happiest as a single mum.She has uprooted the family to Lisbon, in Portugal,  because her adopted son David wants to play professional football.With her vast wealth she could easily have bought him a team such as LA Galaxy but she has always had a Calvinistic work ethic that she has tried to pass on to her kids.She has also made up with son Rocco Ritchie after a bitter custody battle and appears to be in a very good place.In an era where most young female vocalists all sound the same — bored, whiny and more than a wee bit yodelly — we really do need a one-off like Madonna.I hope she had a fabulous birthday on Thursday in Marrakech, Morocco, and danced until dawn to all of her greatest hits.Happy 60th birthday, ma’am, and I’ve no doubt you will still be in your fishnets and basques when you get that 100-year birthday message.Just when the royals and their advisers thought the whole fiasco between Meghan Markle and her dad had gone quiet, there comes a bizarre twist.Meghan’s rent-a-gob half-sister Samantha, who seethes with rage and jealousy, has announced that Thomas Markle is bringing out his own clothing range.This led to speculation as to what the brand might be called.  “Markle \u0026amp Spencer” or “Primarkles”  (thank you, Alan Carr). But joking aside, surely this can’t be a serious  concept.Apart from being a crass, money-grabbing exercise cashing in on a quasi-royal connection, who on earth would buy garments from a pensioner who dresses like a hobo?I’ve had a great deal of sympathy for Thomas  in the past. He was treated poorly in the build-up to the  Royal Wedding, when his daughter married Prince Harry.He should have been embraced by his new family and given guidance on how to deal with the  media attention.Instead he was cast adrift. The result? Those stupid paparazzi set-up photos and a series of interviews that painted Meghan in a poor light.Every time her dad talks on TV or to newspapers and magazines, her popularity is dented.The two of them obviously have a fraught relationship. It turns out Thomas didn’t attend Meghan’s first wedding in 2011 either.Thomas increasingly comes across as bitter, angry and dislikable.To gain media attention he keeps making more and more outrageous accusations.My advice would be to stop listening to his bitchy daughter Samantha and maintain a dignified silence.All thoughts of profiteering through a clothing range or any commercial activity must be abandoned forthwith.That just might mean there could be some  sort of reconciliation in the future.Otherwise he will lose his daughter forever.ONE of the week’s most astonishing stories involved a young US woman who has been given her life back with a groundbreaking face transplant.Three years ago, Katie Stubblefield, from Mississippi in the US, tried to take her own life and shot herself in the face with a hunting rifle. She was just 18.Doctors saved her life but she was left with a mass of scar tissue instead of a face.Katie, the youngest person ever to receive a face transplant, endured more than 30 hours of surgery.Of course, the operation requires a donor – and in this case it is  a very sad story.Katie received the face  of a mum who died of a drug overdose.She was a registered organ donor and her grandmother bravely approved the donation.That decision can’t have been easy and we should always salute those who are donors, and the loved ones who give their consent.Katie won’t look like anything like her donor because the “face” is moulded on to her new bone structure.She continues to heal and  make progress, but this kind of surgery is still in its infancy.She will always look “different” but she has a second chance of life and now wants to help others in anguish and with suicidal thoughts.It’s an incredible story of despair that turned to  hope.  The skill and dedication of the team of surgeons and medics that helped her is awe-inspiring.I’m always surprised to learn that Caroline Flack is 38 years old.The presenter looks a  lot younger – and at the moment she is acting like a lovesick teenager going through the agony and ecstasy of her first serious crush.Her off/on romance with red carpet fever victim Andrew Brady is becoming laughable.This week the couple apparently had yet another spat in a London ­restaurant.If these two are to have any chance of staying together long term, they need to get out of the public eye and spend some quiet time alone.I’m sure Caroline knows of a certain Love Island that isn’t being used right now. That would do very well.The ending of the second series of The Handmaid’s Tale had me shouting in despair at my TV.I don’t want to give away too many spoilers but this cliffhanger will break your heart.It also, however, sets up season three for long overdue revenge.As always, astonishing performances from Elisabeth Moss as  June/Ofglen and Yvonne Strahovski as Serena Joy.They will soon fight it out for real when the TV actress awards are up for grabs.I’ve lost track of the amount of slippers our border terrier puppy Angus has chewed up, but this week he surpassed himself by getting his paws on his Pet Passport and virtually destroying it when we were in Spain.Luckily a  local vet issued him with a Spanish version and he now boasts dual nationality.He’s suddenly developed a liking for an afternoon siesta, but at least we were able to get him back into the UK – although who knows what will happen to him after Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You cannot ask a question of them — as they won’t answer.”American Thomas has been met with a wall of silence from Kensington Palace, including Meghan, 37, since speaking out publicly about her.The Church of Scientology, founded by L Ron Hubbard, has provoked controversy for its practices and secretive methods.It has always strongly denied claims that it is a cult and that it manipulates members.The religion has attracted a huge celebrity following — including film megastars Tom Cruise and John Travolta.The Stepford Wives is a 1970s thriller novel by Ira Levin where men in American suburbia turn their spouses into brainwashed submissive robots.Thomas, an Emmy-winning lighting director, has tried to encourage Meghan and her husband Prince Harry, 33, to contact him — after three months of silence.They have not spoken since the day after the couple’s wedding at Windsor Castle.Thomas, who also has children Samantha, 53, and Tom Jnr, 51, dismissed reports that he was hoping for money from his kids.He said: “I worked hard to provide for my children. I’m their father, I don’t expect them to pay me back.”The retired Hollywood lighting director has openly criticised the Duchess in a series of interviews since her wedding.He claimed he had been completely cut off by Meghan.But people close to Meghan have insisted this is not the case.They said: His behaviour is something she has had to deal with for most of her adult life.There has been a long history of dad disappointment with her life being splattered with upset because of her relationship with him.She isnt shocked or surprised by his behaviour and dealt with it all with a lot of grace.Meghan has also come under fire from her half-sister, Samantha, who urged her to reconnect with her father.Thomas laughed off a claim that he is to launch a clothing range for men — which Meghans half sister Samantha had made in a tweet.He insisted: “It is just a joke.“The only clothes line I have is the one I hang my shirts on to dry.”He was famously pictured being measured for a suit in staged paparazzi shots in the run up to the Royal Wedding.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has to be registered and declared when he spoke. Paisley got 30 days for the same offence.”Mr Corbyn’s office did not respond to a request for comment last night.He has refused to come clean over the costs of the controversial trip.He said he didn’t declare it in the register of MPs’ interests because it fell below the then £660 threshold for which MPs must declare hospitality they’ve received.But revelations in The Sun earlier that he stayed in a luxury 5-star hotel during the trip challenged these claims.Last night a Labour party spokesman claimed Mr Corbyn was not obligated to disclose his trip in the Palestine debate.The spokesman said: “The cost of Jeremy’s trip did not meet the threshold requiring it to be declared. Even if it had, Jeremy wouldn’t have had to declare it in every debate about the broad topic of Israel and Palestine.”GOT a story?

Jeremy did not honour those responsible for the Munich killings”.Holding a wreath should not be reckoned to be any kind of endorsement of the wreath we know Jeremy deplores this kind of thing and, indeed, all other forms of wreath.Hark, though, at how quickly the approved line may shift. What was a “smear” yesterday is a forgotten truth today, airbrushed from history because, well, that’s the way these people do these things.The new line is Jeremy wants to see “a fitting memorial to everyone who died in every terrorist incident everywhere”.I dare say he’ll be visiting Enniskillen soon. Of course.And yet, in one sense there really isn’t very much to look at. Or, rather, very little that is new. This is who Corbyn is and who he has always been.He has never bothered hiding this, leaving one to assume he only does so now because there is some small, nagging part of his brain which accepts it might be sensible to do so, since failing to hide it might prove politically inconvenient.Even so, he cannot change. Anyone who has been at university will recognise Corbyn and all his fellow travellers.These were the people — some of them clever but not many of them intelligent — who fouled student politics for everyone else.The chiselling parsers and pedants and revolutionaries whose appetite for procedural minutiae bored everyone else into submission.And usually that would be that. They would, most of them, grow up eventually. But not St Jeremy and not his devotional disciples, either.They are greyer now but as instantly recognisable as they always were: Experts in room-clearing.They ought, by rights, to be confined to dingy rooms above down-at-heel pubs, where they could cut and paste their thuddingly dreary newsletters. Instead, mystifyingly, they have been given control of one of Britain’s great political parties.How much will this summer of anti-Semitism really cut through with the average voter? Less than you might think, I suspect.In the first place — and this may be a good thing — Twitter remains a niche platform and political Twitter a niche even there.Secondly, the public have already made up their minds about Corbyn and they think he’s a dud.Each month YouGov asks whether Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May seems the best available Prime Minister and each month Corbyn trails.Sometimes he is also beaten by “Don’t know”. That’s Corbyn: He can come third in a two-horse race.But, they splutter, look at what a kind and gentle and decent man he is. Why can’t other people see that he’s a valiant activist for peace?Possibly because, for a decent fellow, he spends a startling amount of time with thoroughly indecent people.He keeps falling in with the wrong crowd while never being a member of the wrong crowd himself. There is no need here to document the long list of unsavoury people with whom Corbyn has been happy to associate himself because, really, what is now the point? He is who he is and we know who he is.In Corbyn’s world every-thing has a single, simple explanation. Colonialism is the root cause of all root causes.That insight — if we can call it that — dictated his views on Ireland just as it dictates his views on the Middle East, Cuba, Venezuela and everywhere else.From there it is but a short leap to the kind of deluded wishful thinking that animates what passes for his thinking. Once you have assumed that Northern Ireland should not exist, you absolve yourself of any and all need to think about what should happen next.You may ignore the inconvenient, and stubborn, reality that Northern Ireland — like, well, Israel — does exist and is not going to disappear.Practical politics means wrestling with things as they are, not as you think they should have been decades previously.But if you start with the theory, you may avoid practical reality. If this leaves you with nothing — precisely nothing — useful to say then so be it. You will at least remain pure in heart.If this means you are no kind of “peace campaigner” at all, that’s fine too, because you will be shielded by your own impenetrable sanctimony.As poses go, this is an awfully comfortable one but it’s not serious politics.Perhaps Corbyn really is just unlucky. But it seems more probable that he’s not. And that, far from being the decent man of legend he’s actually thoroughly indecent.The only possible alternative is that he’s thunderously, crushingly, toe-curlingly thick.On balance, however, it seems more probable that he is, in fact, both.Enough of this. Enough, already.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Retailers and producers would be hit for using or making “virgin plastics”.The crackdown comes after a record 162,000 responses from the public to the Government’s consultation on how to reduce single-use plastics and boost recycling.Treasury minister Robert Jenrick said: “There was clear support for a new incentive for businesses to use recycled plastics over new plastics when producing packaging — such as takeaway boxes or water bottles.“This is about using the tax system intelligently to encourage manufacturers and retailers to take more responsibility for the products that end up in shops.”Campaigners welcomed the move to place the burden for recycling on businesses.The Tories are supposed to stand up for low taxes.Across the Atlantic, President Trump has instituted tax cuts that have contributed to a booming American economy. Margaret Thatcher did the same here in the 80s.As we approach Brexit, it’s time for the Government to embrace a tax-cutting agenda that will turbo-charge the economy.GOT a story?

In this instance, the child was booked on two separate bookings for the outbound and return flights. “While we regret any inconvenience, as no other adult was travelling on the return booking, she could not travel on the flight. “As a gesture of goodwill, the child and an accompanying adult were moved on to another booking on the next available flight, which departed to East Midlands later that day.”But Michelle claimed Daisys family members explained the situation - showing them the letter and passports, which the budget airline had told her mum to give her.  She said a crew member left and came back with a security guard who then allegedly escorted the girl off the plane.Michelle said: My 13-year-old is autistic and was absolutely hysterical. Her 70-year-old godmother was made to leave the plane with her. My daughter was absolutely terrified and is now stranded at Faro airport.

It was wonderful to hear those words.“The next day we sat down and looked through all the photographs.If his memory starts to fade, we will have all those photographs and the video to show him how perfect our day was and how happy we were.”Daniel said: “Everything went so fast, it was like a twilight zone, but it was the perfect day.”Jordan added: We had such a special and memorable day. We felt like we blinked and the day was over but we couldn’t be happier with how Dan was feeling on the day, and how supportive our family and friends were.A lot of them travelled from all over the UK to join us on the day and that meant a lot to Dan and I.

We did research ourselves before then but its not good news to take onboard.I have found acceptance now and Im sure Jordan has as well it is still hard.He was diagnosed in September last year, and the couple decided to get married as soon as possible so they could both fully enjoy the day.His disease is caused by a genetic mutation called PSEN1 inherited from his dad Adrian, who died from the condition when he was just 36 years-old.Doctors only discovered Adrian had Alzheimers 25 years after his death, when Daniel started showing the same symptoms.Fewer than 600 people worldwide have been diagnosed with it.Tragically they now know there is a 50 per cent chance the couples twins will develop it to.But the family plan to ensure they do as much together as possible before Daniel becomes more restricted.They have a bucket list of things to tick off - including walking the twins to their first day of school and holidaying in Florida.The Bradbury family and Alzheimer’s Society are urgently calling on people to unite against dementia and take part in Memory Walk – register now at memorywalk.org.uk"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0003704020881.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"major london station closed from today for three weekends including bank holiday","story":"There will be no trains to or from the London station on August 18-19, August 25-27 and September 1-2.Network Rail is calling on West Coast main line passengers to avoid rail travel unless its essential to and from the capital over the next three weekends.The station is closing as part of Britains Railway Upgrade Plan, which includes Network Rail replacing North Wembley junction - a major intersection on Europes busiest mixed-use railway.Route managing director for Network Rails London North Western route, Martin Frobisher, said: There is never an ideal time to shut the railway but these three weekends are the least disruptive times to do it.We have worked together for the past three years with train operators to carefully plan this closure of the railway in a way that minimises impact on customers.Its vital the track at North Wembley is replaced to continue to safely meet the huge demand of passenger and freight rail services on the West Coast main line.

Well, you must have been getting your news from the BBC, then.This was the latest example of Corbyn simpering around terrorists. Honouring scumbags who massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.The Black September gangsters castrated their male victims while they were still alive.But then, Corbyn was happy to attend the funerals of dead IRA terrorists. That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart. An important story.Good people have left Labour as a consequence. The Jewish community in the UK is in uproar.Frightened of the far Left’s support for vile Islamists and its loathing of Israel and its right to exist.Scared of the morons who now lead Labour and its retinue of lefties who have said the most appalling, racist, stuff about Jews.Jeremy Corbyn, a genuine halfwit, thinks it is all “fake news”.He rolls his eyes when asked about it and gives different answers every time he is questioned.And guess who agrees with him? Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes. Ignored it.Everyone else — including the left-wing  — thought it important.Instead, the front page of the BBC’s online news carried no fewer than SIX stories about former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the allegations of Islamophobia made against him. Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this?

But I\u0027m not going to tell you about Aretha Franklin\u0027s failings. They don\u0027t matter to a single one of us, and they don\u0027t matter any more to those closest to her. Aretha reached. That\u0027s the only word I can find to describe how her life panned out, what she achieved and what she meant. She lost her mother at 10, was pregnant by a school friend at 11, a mother at 12 and again at 15, daughter to a perverted superstar preacher who ran drug-and-sex orgies, and wife to a pimp who beat her. Singer Sam Cooke, a friend of her father\u0027s, is thought to have had sex with a 12-year-old Aretha when he was 23. Etta James, who died six years ago, was in the same congregation and said: I can understand Aretha not wanting to talk about that . . . Who wants to admit that you’re praising the Lord at the 8 p.m. service and servicing some drop-dead gorgeous hunk of a singer an hour later? Today, it\u0027s called child abuse. It\u0027s abandonment, vulnerable girls, predatory men, the most troubled and turbulent background it\u0027s possible to imagine. Yet through it Aretha reached - in the period after her mother died, she learned to play the piano by ear.  She went on the gospel circuit with her father, had her first two children and signed her first record deal. She almost signed to Tamla\u0027s motown label, which worked wonders for Diana Ross but would have buried Aretha\u0027s talent. She did better at Columbia, but in 1966 signed to the soul label Atlantic and hit the heights.  In February 1967 she released first single I Never Loved A Man. The B-side was Do Right Woman, Do Right Man. The B-side. In April she released her version of Otis Redding\u0027s Respect and in the space of just 3 months she was a megastar.  She did all that by the time she was 25, and with two children. She did it with a crappy childhood, sexual exploitation, and at a time when women and black women in particular were segregated, sidelined, and dehumanised. She did it because she reached back into her life, found the love and the pain, and hauled it up like Jonah wrestling his whale. Listen to her quiet, sad, dignified request for men to treat her kindly, and ask yourself who else could perform the same feat.  Aretha became a star for the same reason as Elvis Presley - she reached across the race divide. But while Elvis made black music acceptable by being a sexy white boy, Aretha showed that black and white both hurt the same. There\u0027s not a woman on the planet who doesn\u0027t want a Do Right Man, and after listening to that song, no man who doesn\u0027t want to do better. She sold 75million records to people who were not born in a wooden shack, weren\u0027t raised by perverts, had no interest in Baptist gospel and who nevertheless felt at one with her. When I was a teenager, she whispered in my ear about unrequited love. When I was a woman, she and I belted out songs about freedom and joy. When I fell in love we sang of our sweet, sweet baby, and when I was heartbroken, she raged with me about The House That Jack Built. And she winked at me and nodded when I changed our lyrics to demand he never came back. She was us. They were all our songs. And if she reached through it all, then we knew we could find the strength to do the same.  There is a moment in every one of her songs where you think she\u0027s given it all she can. Then she takes a breath, reaches, and finds some more. I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s her diaphragm, her voice, or just plain magic but it elevates whoever hears it. Douglas Adams described Mark Knopfler as a man capable of making his guitar hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night said there was a moment in every Dire Straits song where it is possible to fly. Well, Aretha sings like the angels\u0027 jaded, yet hopeful barmaid, and there is a point in every song where she lifts the weight of the world from everyone\u0027s shoulders. Her loved ones said she never sought help for her demons, never truly dealt with her drinking, gorging, and trips to mental clinics. Instead she went on stage. Perhaps if she had the help she deserved she would not have helped the rest of us realise we were not alone. She kept back the careers of her sisters, raged at friends, threw strops that would have embarrassed Henry VIII, but I don\u0027t care that she must have been hell to live with. With her, the rest of us had heaven on Earth.  She played piano like it was a percussion instrument. She arranged many of her own songs, and had the same natural talent for music that the rest of us do for breathing. But there\u0027s one story that tells you more about her than anything else.  In 1998 she was at the Grammys to perform her Blues Brothers version of Think, with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Her friend Luciano Pavarotti was due to perform Nessun Dorma, and despite rehearsing it perfectly he called in 30 minutes after the show began to say he had a cold and could no longer sing.  Aretha was asked to fill the gap, perhaps do one of her signature tracks. She asked instead to hear Pavarotti\u0027s rehearsal. Producer Ken Ehrlich said: In those days we had a boombox with a cassette. And I brought it to her and played it for her. When she heard it, she said, ‘Yeah, I can do this\u0027. She went out on stage, for a live, worldwide broadcast, with an orchestra she\u0027d not practised with, a choir she didn\u0027t know and a nervous conductor, and sang, in Italian, one of the most iconic and powerful songs in the world. One minute in, she reaches. Then reaches again, and again, and you\u0027re wowed, and somehow she reaches twice more and hits the final high note. Those final words, translated, are: At dawn, I will win. I will win, I will win!  At 16 Aretha had toured with Martin Luther King, and 10 years later sang at his funeral. She was rightly honoured and lauded throughout her later life, in 1987 she became the first woman inducted into the Rock\u0027n\u0027Roll Hall of Fame, and she even had an asteroid named after her. She\u0027s been called the greatest singer of all time, the voice of the civil rights movement, and much else besides. She was a spendthrift, a diva, and had a mink coat that she loved so much it used to have its own seat. Through it all, she remained an insecure little girl who thought she wasn\u0027t good enough. Still she reached for something more. More food, more drink, more men, more, more, more than this. And that\u0027s where her magic lay - the ability to show hope amid pain, to see potential in a poverty of experience. That is, after all, the thing that makes us human. We can rise, and when her voice soars it makes you feel that you have, and you can. If that\u0027s not soul, I don\u0027t know what is. In 2015 at a ceremony honouring songwriter Carol King, Aretha performed Natural Woman. She thumped those piano keys like they were in trouble, her voice hit the song at full speed, and Barack Obama wept 20 seconds after she\u0027d opened her mouth. Halfway through, she stands up and reaches for a high note as the auditorium gives her a standing ovation. She throws that mink coat to the floor, and finds more. She goes on, and up, and up, and there\u0027s nothing the audience can do but clap harder. She was a natural woman. She made us feel what it was like to be her, and to be us, and to be human. She showed us what soul was, and she\u0027ll never stop because that voice will never be silent. My daughter will grow up with Aretha in her ears, feeling that they two alone share a secret. You make us feel, Aretha. You always will.

Now vegans won\u0027t have to miss out on the fun, as Asda is going to sell a non-dairy cheeseboard when the festive season rolls round.  The board has three different types of plant-based cheese: a traditional cheddar style vegan cheese, a garlic and chive cheddar and a Wensleydale and cranberry alternative. The cheeseboard costs \u0026pound5, which is a bit of a bargain to be honest. However, it won\u0027t be on sale until 22 November, when the cheeseboard season really gets going.   It\u0027s not the first festive vegan offering from Asda. Last year, vegan mince pies were introduced , with the chain predicting it would sell a whopping 18 million of them.   Veganism has grown enormously in the UK. According to a survey conducted in April, 3.5 million Brits now eat a vegan diet - that\u0027s seven per cent of the population who are shunning animal products.   There are all kinds of vegan cheese out there these days, like cashew nut milk Camembert and plant-based blue.   Back in May, ASDA’s product development manager James Waters stated in a press release : We know how big the free from and vegan markets have become and understand that there is a demand for more free from and vegan products”.

Bob Coughtrey helped obsessed Donna Hartley through her test in six weeks. She then started a terrifying campaign.  He has been forced to move house and install CCTV . And he has counselling over fears she will track him down again.  Hartley, 29, got a suspended sentence last August after bombarding Bob with texts and turning up at his home. Within 12 months, she was convicted again after threatening to kill him – but got another suspended sentence. Bob, from Lincolnshire, said: “I’m always on edge in public, looking for a safe place and quick exit. I want to feel safe.  “What will it take for Donna to be jailed? She made my life hell and showed no regard for the first sentence. It makes a farce of the whole justice system.” He is backing the Sunday People’s campaign for a national stalkers register, adding: “I will do all I can for stalking to be taken more seriously.” Bob’s ordeal began after Hartley passed her test in June 2017 and messaged him saying she wished she had failed so they could spend more time together. “I didn’t reply but she sent loads of messages, some of which threatened self-harm,” he said.  Bob called the police , who went to check she was OK – and he was asked to call and get Hartley to let them in. He said: “I reluctantly agreed. Engaging with her was what I wanted to avoid.”  Hartley kept texting, calling and visiting his Lancashire home. She asked to meet and hug him. One text read: “I don’t want to hurt you but you can hurt me.”  She was arrested in August 2017 after turning up at his home and threatening suicide. She admitted stalking at Blackpool magistrates court and got an indefinite restraining order, plus eight weeks’ jail, suspended for 18 months, and 20 days’ rehabilitation. Bob thought the ordeal was over – until police contacted him in June. He said: “Donna told her psychiatrist she wanted to hold me hostage, torture me with a knife and kill me. I went stone cold.” As she re-offended within her suspended term, Bob assumed Hartley would be jailed or sectioned by Blackpool magistrates last month. But she got 16 weeks’ jail, suspended for two years. “I couldn’t believe it,” said Bob. “While she walks free, I don’t feel safe. The law has failed to protect me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family 11 split up across","story":"NewsFamily-of-11 split up across three flats 100 miles from home because council can\u0027t find house big enoughSimone and Ansar Hussain, from Birmingham, were put up in hotels for two months before being moved into apartmentsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAshley Preece21:02, 18 AUG 2018NewsSimone and Ansar Hussain with six of their children (Image: BristolLive)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A family-of-11 have been split up across three apartment blocks 100 miles from their home town because their local council can\u0027t find a house big enough for all of them.  The Hussain family, from Birmingham, has been cooped up in hotels or flats as far away as Burton-upon-Trent and Bristol for 65 days. They are currently living in three flats in Bristol city centre as they wait for a home that can accommodate mum Simone, dad Ansar and their nine children aged between 17 months and 19 years.  The family told Birmingham Live they were illegally evicted from their privately-rented flat and they are nearing their breaking point.   Simone, 39, said: “I’m crying almost all the time now. She added: “We’ve got our nine kids with us which is hard and my 17-month-old is struggling to sleep. The other children are aged four, six, eight, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 19. Simone said: I’ve got a 21-year-old daughter back home too in Coleshill who I haven’t seen since this all started in June and that upsets me.”  She said the family were forced out of their home in Great Barr due to severe leaking and electrical faults. Birmingham City Council said they accepted their application after the family were illegally evicted from their privately-rented flat. They confirmed the family are on the housing register at the highest priority banding, but there are very few six-bedroom properties available After moving out of their rented house on June 13, the Hussains were sent to a Travelodge in Burton as their three-bed property was deemed unsafe to live in.  Twenty-eight days followed as the parents continued with the school run in Great Barr, continually going back and forth in what would have been a gruelling 42-mile trip. The family’s month-long stay ended in Burton and they were sent packing 30 minutes away to another Travelodge - this time in Rugeley. Simone, who receives \u0026pound430-a-week in child tax credit, said: “Travelodges were horrible. You don’t have a kitchen so we couldn’t cook. “Eating out is extortionate. I kept having to borrow and borrow money - not only that but we were just stuck in a room all day and we still are.  “The kids are away from their friends all of the time. It’s just depressing and not fair on them.” After another 28-day stay at a Travelodge, the Hussains were moved on again and they were chauffeured 120 miles away to apartments in the middle of Bristol city centre, where they’re currently residing. Simone added: “The council paid for our taxis. They sent us three black cabs and the meter at the end was \u0026pound208 - that’s 600 quid in black cabs alone. “The apartments down here are better because I can cook now and get some shopping in and stuff but, as a family, we’re spread across three apartments. It’s far from ideal.  “I think it’s about \u0026pound150-a-night to stay here because my mum was going to come down. It’s scary. “I feel my kids are missing out on stuff, too. There’s not a lot to do - there’s no parks close by and we’re spending a fortune on petrol and parking. “We’re sweating now as well because the new school year is around the corner and I’ve got to get school uniforms. How am I meant to do that?” The Hussains were hopeful they’d return to Birmingham by August 28 but, according to the family, have now been told it is looking like September 25 instead.

The close and unrequited bond the pair once had now appears to be in tatters as Thomas Markle and Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha take it in turns to make public digs at Meghan, her husband Prince Harry and the Royal Family .  Meghan, however, has kept a dignified silence - and reportedly not spoken to her father since her wedding almost three months ago. But in a fresh outburst yesterday Mr Markle said of the Royal Family: “They are cult-like —– like Scientology — because they are secretive.  They close the door, pull the shades down and put their fingers in their ears so they don’t have to hear.  However before the now Duchess of Sussex, 37, met Harry she lovingly described Mr Markle as the most hardworking father you can imagine.  She laid bare her love for the man who always believed she would be a success and who made sacrifices so she could fulfill her dream of becoming an actress. She also told of the heartwarming Christmas gift her father gave her as a child, which she pictured him getting glares for from mums. And the only time she ever saw him so enraged it made his \u0027eyes pop\u0027. Meghan has also revealed the four words her father told her that will stay with her forever: “Draw your own box.” It was after Meghan came home one day from school upset.  Recalling the incident, she says she had to fill out a census form before an English exam and tick whether she was white, black, Hispanic or Asian. Being biracial - with a Caucasian father and a African American mother - she didn\u0027t know which box she fitted into, so out of confusion and sadness she left it blank. When she told her father what happened she admits she had never seen him angry before, but she could see the blotchiness of his skin crawling from pink to red. It made the green of his eyes pop and his brow was weighted at the thought of his daughter being prey to ignorance, she said. And in one of those parenting moments that no guidebook could ever prep you for, my dad said words that will stay with me forever: \u0027Draw your own box.\u0027    He wanted me to see beyond that census placed in front of me. He wanted me to find my own truth. Meghan has made no secret of struggling with her identity growing up, even saying her 20s were brutal.  She recalls being at home in LA on a college break when her mother, Doria Ragland , was called the ‘N’ word.  She said: We were leaving a concert and she wasn’t pulling out of a parking space quickly enough for another driver. My skin rushed with heat as I looked to my mom. Her eyes welling with hateful tears, I could only breathe out a whisper of words, so hushed they were barely audible: ‘It’s OK, Mommy.’ I was trying to temper the rage-filled air permeating our small silver Volvo. We drove home in deafening silence, her chocolate knuckles pale from gripping the wheel so tightly.  Meanwhile, so conscious his young daughter was wrestling with who she was as a person, Mr Markle one Christmas took apart two Barbie boxed sets, which came as a white Barbie family or a black one, to make a custom one for Meghan. When I was about seven, I had been fawning over a boxed set of Barbie dolls, she said. It was called The Heart Family and included a mom doll, a dad doll, and two children. This perfect nuclear family was only sold in sets of white dolls or black dolls. I don’t remember coveting one over the other, I just wanted one. On Christmas morning, swathed in glitter-flecked wrapping paper, there I found my Heart Family: a black mom doll, a white dad doll, and a child in each color. My dad had taken the sets apart and customized my family.

The Duchess of Sussex’s estranged half-sister Samantha is said to be locked in negotiations with American cable channel Bravo over a fly-on-the-wall series. The station has said to have offered Samantha, 53, a “bumper pay deal” - and executives are desperate to get Meghan’s outspoken dad Thomas, 74, on board too.  A source said: “They want something that is similar to Keeping Up With The Kardashians .”  Neither Thomas nor Samantha attended the former Suits star’s wedding to Prince Harry at Windsor Castle and have repeatedly hit out at the Royal Family since the ceremony in May. Samantha and Meghan have not spoken since 2015.  Last month, 53-year-old Samantha claimed Meghan hadn’t spoken to her dad since her big day - and spoke of fears he’d die of sadness if they didn’t reconcile. Samantha said: “I’m desperate for Meghan to meet up with Dad when she’s back. If she doesn’t it would be really cruel and hurtful and would break his heart. “I speak to him every day. He’s very sensitive and I see his health suffering as a result of this. I hope they can meet in a quiet place, spend some quality time together and gain closure on what’s been an incredibly sad time for him. “If they don’t I’m worried he’ll die of sadness. I just want her to get in touch before it’s too late. Life’s short – neither of them deserves to be left with the consequences.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles uncle reveals deep","story":"NewsMeghan Markle\u0027s uncle reveals deep hurt over royal wedding “snub” - and says he could have walked her down the aisleEXCLUSIVE: Florida resident Michael Markle was \"surprised\" he didn\u0027t make wedding guest list after all he\u0027s contributed to niece\u0027s lifeShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRussell Myers20:30, 18 AUG 2018NewsMichael Markle has explained why he has been the most loyal relative of Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex (Image: Coleman-Rayner)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghgan Markle’s uncle has spoken of his deep hurt over his royal wedding “snub” and said he would have happily walked her down the aisle. Former US diplomat Michael Markle insisted that despite his worsening health, he would have flown over from his home in Palm Bay, Florida. Meghan’s dad Thomas, 74, had to pull out of the wedding at short notice following a heart attack. Older brother Michael suffers from Parkinson’s disease but told the Sunday Mirror that wouldn’t have stopped him doing the honours as his niece married Prince Harry at Windsor Castle in May. Michael told how he had always supported Meghan and “done more for her” over the years than anyone else.  He admitted that Parkinson’s “is getting me now”. But asked if he had the strength to be by Meghan’s side, he proudly added: “Sure, I could have, if it was co-ordinated. Yes, I would have done it.” Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland was the only member of the bride’s family to attend the wedding. And Michael, 78, said he was surprised he didn’t make the guest list for the ceremony at St George’s Chapel. Speaking from his modest trailer park home, Michael wondered whether former actress Meghan, 37, may have been instructed not to make any exceptions in terms of which family members should get an invitation. He said: “I thought I would. But anyhow, I didn’t hear from her. “And I don’t know how much the Royal Family had influence on her or not. They didn’t accept anyone else so they couldn’t make an exception for me.” Michael was speaking after a barrage of insults and interviews directed at the royals by other members of his family.  Meghan’s dad has revealed intimate details of conversations with Prince Harry, 33, and even confessed how he lied to the Duke of Sussex about faking pictures with a British paparazzi. The photographs showed Thomas looking at Meghan and Harry’s engagement pictures on an internet cafe computer – and him apparently being measured for a wedding suit at a tailors. It turned out they were all staged. Now Thomas feels he has been dumped by his daughter. For years he worked long hours as a Hollywood lighting technician to help Meghan through private school and realise her dream of becoming an actress. With Meghan’s half-sister Samantha boasting of an upcoming salacious biography titled In The Shadows Of The Duchess, Michael insists he is the only member of the Markle family who has shown any loyalty.  He revealed how his connections helped secure Meghan a prestigious internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, when she was 20. Michael said: “I’ve done more for her than the others. I’ve probably done more for her than most. I personally talked to the ambassador in Argentina for her.” Controversy over the wedding arrangements has haunted Harry and Meghan since the date was first set. The former Suits star told her father there was “no room” for him to make a speech – even when he said he wished to pay tribute to the couple at the reception. Other Markle relatives weighed in with their tuppence worth, causing huge embarrassment before and after the big day. And amid the fake pics furore, Thomas pulled out of the ceremony suffering heart problems with just days to go.  The whole, sorry saga has left Meghan even more reliant on mum Doria, 61, who has been her rock throughout. Michael has previously told how he thought his niece’s attitude towards her family was “uncalled for”. He said before the wedding: “I don’t understand why she has been so \u0026shyindifferent towards me. It’s uncalled for. I helped her out and I didn’t ask for anything in return.” Despite the disappointment at missing out on the big day, a neighbour at the trailer park retirement village told how Michael was delighed about the wedding. After moving in to his \u0026pound78,000 home he told everyone about his niece.  The source said: “He’s very proud of Meghan. When he moved in he asked everyone if they knew who she was and that she was marrying Prince Harry.” Meghan is expected to move her mum from the US to London as she embarks on the next stage of her marriage. She is said to want children as soon as possible after she and Harry return from their first major tour in October. The couple will spend a fortnight in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. In Sydney they will launch the fourth Invictus Games, the hugely successful sporting event which former soldier Harry founded for injured servicemen and women.  A royal insider said: “The trip is likely to be a welcome distraction for everyone, but especially for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. “Royal aides have been increasingly under pressure to find a way out of this crisis as the Markle family show no signs of keeping quiet. “So far Meghan and Harry have decided to stay quiet but something will have to give sooner rather than later.” Earlier this month it was revealed how royal advisers have held a series of crisis summits on how to stop Thomas Markle from heaping further distress on his daughter.  At least three meetings have taken place between Meghan and Harry’s senior team and other royal advisers to find a solution. Three options have been laid out to Meghan to try to resolve the public breakdown in relations with her dad. Our source said: “It’s an increasingly desperate situation and now it’s come down to three options being on the table. “Firstly, Meghan could contact her father straight away and appeal to him directly to stop hurting her.

Once that happens, there will be some serious shake ups in the Royal Family . William will be the King of England, Kate will become Queen and Prince George will be next in line to the throne.   Princess Charlotte will still be a princess. But there\u0027s another very special title she will inherit when King Will is on the throne.  Her future title is actually even fancier than Her Royal Highness\u0027s name already: Princess Royal.  However, the title is not up for grabs just yet as it already belongs to someone else. Traditionally, Princess Royal is bestowed to the eldest daughter of the monarch. So it\u0027s currently held by Charlotte\u0027s great aunt and the Queen\u0027s sis, Princess Anne - who is 68. If she passes away, the title may be transferred to Princess Charlotte, but it doesn\u0027t happen automatically and is up to Prince William.  Royal expert and author of Prince Harry : The Inside Story, Duncan Larcombe told Town and Country , The title of Princess Royal is traditionally bestowed on the eldest daughter of the monarch.  Princess Anne had to wait until 1987 before her mother the queen bestowed the title of Princess Royal on her, even though the title had been vacant since 1965.

Kate, 19, was overwhelmed with shock when she was picked out from 40 other candidates to be crowned Teen Ultimate Beauty Of The World. The pageant is held to celebrate \u0026shydiversity and people who are “beautiful inside and out” – and supports the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a charity which makes dreams come true for poorly children. Kate had dabbled with modelling before the two-day event and \u0026shyentered it only for experience. And she admitted it was a massive surprise when she heard her name read out as the winner. She said: “I was in shock. My family were all in the audience, \u0026shycrying and cheering. “My dream has come true. And that dream is to get a chance to inspire young people who have Down’s \u0026shysyndrome and other special needs to believe in themselves.”  Kate had been invited to enter as the representative for her native Northern Ireland by the pageant’s director, Taylor-Rae Hamilton. Taylor-Rae was one of hundreds of people touched by a message Kate’s mum Deirdre had posted on Facebook asking for support in her attempts to become a successful model. Kate travelled just 25 miles from her home in Cookstown, Co Tyrone, to the contest venue in Portadown, where other candidates had assembled after flying in from all around the world to represent their nations.  The pageant has three categories for kids, teens and over-20s and is open to anyone regardless of weight, height or marital status. The contest began with an interview by a panel of judges. Kate’s mum was not allowed in the room with her, but could hear her making the judges laugh. Deirdre said: “I knew she’d charm them but what made me most proud was how Kate looked after other candidates, \u0026shyencouraging and supporting them.” That evening, candidates of all ages mingled at a “get to you know you” party with a tropical beach theme. Day Two was catwalk day. The first round was casual, so Kate wore jeans and a white T-shirt. The second round was called Time to Shine, which Kate said “meant hair curled, make-up applied and a sparkling, turquoise sequined dress, channelling my inner Little Mermaid”.  For the formal round, Kate wore a black and white cocktail dress with a side split. She said: “I sashayed down the catwalk giving it all my sass. I just wanted to have fun and truly expected someone else’s name to be called as the winner. “Now I’ll be attending photoshoots throughout the year and will be a judge and mentor at next year’s final. “Most importantly I’ll be involved in an appeal where we’ll deliver hundreds of toys to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. I want to give poorly children a moment of sunshine.” Kate has previously walked the catwalk at Belfast Fashion Week and taken part in campaigns for boutiques in her home town.Today she will be wearing her sash and crown again at the start of the Red Dress Run in aid of the Chest, Heart and Stroke Foundation in Lurgan, Co Armagh.  But the road to success has not been easy. When she was born doctors told her parents Deirdre and John to \u0026shyprepare for the worst and hope for the best. Deirdre said: “After two sons, John and I were thrilled to be expecting a girl. “When Kate was born it was confirmed she had Down’s syndrome within hours. “The doctor painted a bleak future. He said she wouldn’t learn to read, her speech would be limited and she’d never hold full conversations. I thought of him as she made her acceptance speech up on the stage at the pageant, describing her hopes for an inclusive society, one where people like her are treated as equals.” Deirdre and John agreed to raise Kate no differently to their sons Patrick and Michael, then 11 and two. Two years later younger sister Ella joined the family. Deirdre said: “When she announced at 13 she wanted to be a model we didn’t discredit the idea just because she had Down’s syndrome.” Kate discovered a passion for make-up, clothes and fashion and never wavered in her ambition. But she \u0026shystruggled to get any gigs. Her mum emailed agencies with photos but was \u0026shytold there was no work.

The dinky white car slowly sunk into the \u002720ft-deep\u0027 crater while shocked passersby watched on in amazement. Luke Davies said his mum Karen didn\u0027t believe it when people told her what had happened - and she thought it was all a joke. It took two vehicles to pull the car out of the sinkhole at Craig y Nos Castle in the upper Swansea Valley.  Mr Davies said he was in Swansea when he had a call from his father telling him about what happened, reports Wales Online .   The 30-year-old said his mum - who works in the castle - had left the car in the car park in the morning and that not long before she was due to finish work at around 4pm she found out about the sinkhole. She was in shock and at first she thought it was a joke, he added. The car was upside down. A customer was in the car park when it started sinking - they saw it happen and how it gradually went down. They spoke to a member of staff but by the time my mum found out the car had sunk completely.  They believe the sinkhole may have been caused by a stream of water coming from the mountain opposite the castle, he continued, eroding the ground under the car park. Mr Davies, from Coelbren in Powys , said the manager attached a rope to his truck and to the car to stop it from going any further as, below the car, the sinkhole was 18 to 20 feet in the deepest part. He said: The pictures don\u0027t do justice to how deep it was - I didn\u0027t realise how bad it was until I saw it. We had to wait for recovery for a couple of hours and then they were concerned about causing more damage to the car while towing it out. We did consider getting a crane but we couldn\u0027t get one.

Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba should never have been struck off – but who can blame the parents for wanting to prevent a similar tragedy ever happening to anyone else? As a mum myself, I have the greatest, heart-rending sympathy for the parents of six-year-old Jack Adcock, who died just 12 hours after being admitted to hospital with vomiting and diarrhoea. His life could easily have been saved, had the seriousness of his condition been spotted in time. Quite understandably, Victor and Nicky Adcock feel anger as well as grief. So when Dr Bawa-Garba was convicted of manslaughter and struck off the medical register, they vowed to celebrate with champagne at Jack’s grave.  This week, however, eight years after their little boy’s death, they were dealt an unexpected blow – and one which has left them reeling. Because last Tuesday the General Medical Council overturned its previous decision and reinstated Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba to the register so she can return to work. Indeed, they now say she should never have been struck off, and that she was “a competent and useful doctor, who can provide considerable useful future service to society.” Like the Adcocks, I was at first stunned. As Jack’s mum said this week: “How can somebody make that many mistakes, be found guilty by a jury and be able to practise again? If you walked into a hospital and saw that doctor, would you be happy for her to treat your child?” Not me, I thought. But dig a bit deeper, and it is so much more complicated than that. Terrible tragedy though it was, was it also a case of an overworked and under-supported doctor being “thrown under the bus” as the huge social media storm has suggested?

Earlier, Taylor - who family recently claimed \u0027didn\u0027t care about what she\u0027d done - said facing charges is scary but she will accept whatever the prosecutor gives me.  Taylor spoke out after the charge, telling ABC News: I accept the charges maturely and all I can do is hope for the best for Jordan and myself, Smith told late Friday.  Jordan, initially said she \u0027didn\u0027t really want\u0027 Taylor to get into trouble but earlier this week she told NBC News : I\u0027m kind of wanting her to sit in jail and think about at least what she did.  She added: I\u0027m in a lot of pain. In the mornings it\u0027s the worst, like it hurts to breathe. My side hurts. My shoulder hurts. I can\u0027t even get up. Jordan suffered serious injuries in the plunge, including six broken ribs, a punctured lung and air bubbles in her chest after she plunged the equivalent of three storeys into Lewis River at Moulton Falls Regional Park near Vancouver on August 7.  According to the complaint filed in Clark County district court, Jordan told authorities that Taylor was the one who pushed her and that it was unwanted. Taylor admitted to pushing her off the bridge but told authorities she did so in an attempt to help her friend overcome her fear and not to injure her. Earlier Friday Taylor said she didn\u0027t consider the repercussions beforehand, adding: She wanted to jump and she was scared and she had asked me to give her a push, and I didn\u0027t think about the consequences. I thought she would be fine. Taylor said she immediately apologised several times after the incident and even tried to visit her in the hospital but was asked to leave.  She said Jordan has since stopped speaking to her. Jordan said she had initially wanted to jump off the bridge after seeing a friend do it, but she got scared when she got to the top. She said: She was counting down but I didn’t think anything of it. And I was like, \u0027No, don’t count down, like, I won’t go if you count down. I’m not ready.\u0027 And then she pushed me. Jordan said she didn\u0027t feel any pain but adrenaline kicked in after she belly-flopped into the water. But Taylor claimed she never intended to hurt her friend, adding: I\u0027m really sorry it turned out that way. I just pray that she heals and gets better.  Dramatic video footage captured Jordan falling dozens of feet from the bridge in Moulton Falls Regional Park, Yacolt. The teenager could be seen standing nervously at the edge of the structure, before her pal, later identified as Taylor, pushed her from behind. Surrounded by friends, she was reportedly heard saying no twice, before plunging into the Lewis River. She landed with a \u0027belly flop\u0027.  Jordan sister, Vanessa, spoke to KOIN in Canada shortly after the incident.  I think she [the friend] tried to do it jokingly and didn\u0027t think what could have happened, Vanessa said. You don\u0027t really play around at 60 feet.

Celeste Ayala, from Berisso in Argentina, was working on guard duty at the Sor Maria Ludovica chuldren\u0027s hospital in Buenos Aires when the baby was brought in crying inconsolably, suffering from malnutrition. Hearing the child\u0027s desperate cries of hunger, her maternal instinct kicked in. She asked staff if she could hold and feed him as it was clear they were overloaded with work.  As she started to breastfeed him, the baby immediately began to relax.    Speaking to local media , Celeste said: I noticed that he was hungry, as he was putting his hand into his mouth, so I asked to hug him and breastfeed him.  It was a sad moment, it broke my soul seeing him like this, society should be sensitive to the issues affecting children, it cannot keep happening. She said that she didn\u0027t think twice about helping the poor baby. A colleague of the police officer praised her for her actions on social media. According to Marcos Heredia, hospital staff said the baby was dirty, but that didn\u0027t deter Celeste. He took a touching photo of her breastfeeding the starving baby and shared it online.  He said: I want to make public this great gesture of love you made today for this little baby who you did not know, but for who you did not hesitate to act like a mother. You did not care if he was dirty, which is what the hospital staff called him. Good job mate. According to local media, the malnourished baby is the youngest of six siblings from a single mother who is struggling to cope and in a desperate situation.

The Russian president, who brought a troupe of Cossack singers with him, danced arm-in-arm with bride Karin Kneissl as guests cheered them on. Kneissl, 53, has been condemned for inviting Putin, 65, to Saturday\u0027s nuptials, with critics calling for her resignation and accusing her of undermining the EU\u0027s stance against the Kremlin. But despite the controversy Putin showed up with a bouquet of flowers and a group of singers, and even made a toast in German at the wedding.  The president attended the ceremony before meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel near Berlin to discuss Syria, Ukraine, and energy matters. Photos show Kneissl, wearing a long white and cream dirndl dress, smiling and talking to Putin as they dance at the vineyard in Gamlitz in southern Austria. It appears they laughed over a joke while dancing following her wedding to entrepreneur Wolfgang Meilinger.  The Kremlin said Putin made a toast in German at the wedding. Putin said before the talks with Merkel: It was a nice trip. It was a private visit. Kneissl faced criticism for inviting Putin to the wedding - a move that surprised many in Vienna and Moscow. Critics argued that it undermines the EU\u0027s stance against Moscow over issues such as the conflict in Ukraine. Hanna Hopko, a Ukrainian MP and head of the country\u0027s committee on foreign affairs, tweeted: Wedding is a private thing. However it goes without saying: if you invite Vladimir Putin to your wedding, you are not neutral anymore.  From now on, Austria can’t be a mediator in Ukraine. Period. Joerg Leichtfried, from the opposition Social Democrats, tweeted that Austria\u0027s current presidency of the Council of the European Union put it in an especially delicate spot given tensions between Putin and the West. He said: All the more symbolic and harmful to court the Russian president in this manner. Putin and Austria\u0027s Foreign Ministry have rejected the criticism over his appearance at her wedding. There have been no reports that Kneissl has a particularly close friendship with Putin.

I complicate my game sometimes but I’m working on just playing it simple and that’s what the gaffer and (assistant manager) Laurie Ellis want me to do.“They stress to me I have to play it simple at times and then do the magic when I can.”Not that it’s an easy process and Glass admits when he’s on the pitch he wants to be involved at the sharp end, doing the things that help win games.“I like to create chances and I really love to get shots in on the goal, it’s what my game is about.“I’m an attacking player and I like to excite but you can’t always do that and sometimes it is about keeping things simple and doing it for the team.”As those words show, this is a young man who does not lack confidence in his own ability but he’s also one who gives an honest assessment of his performances.For instance, while he was delighted to have played his part in a young United line-up that battled back from two goals down to beat St Johnstone’s U/21s in the Betfred Cup on Wednesday night, he was far from completely satisfied with his work.“It was a brilliant result, all the boys worked really hard to come from two behind like we did.“Obviously, the experienced players helped us a lot but I thought the young boys, including myself, dug in and we battled and battled.“St Johnstone were no mugs and I thought they really impressed so it was good to get on top of them by the end.“I know I wasn’t at my best but, like all the boys, I dug in and helped get the result.“I was maybe trying too hard at times for the killer pass or maybe trying to shoot too early.“Sometimes things don’t come off on the park but I still worked hard and helped the team and that’s what you have to make sure you do.”As he keeps grafting towards making the breakthrough in the first team on a regular basis, Glass was delighted by the victory, not least because it means there will be further opportunities to show he is ready.“This cup is a chance to get 90 minutes and, if I’m not playing in the league, I need to get games somewhere.“If it’s in the Irn-Bru Cup it’s better for me and the other boys, because they are very competitive, like league games.“You want to win them, both teams do, and it gives you the chance to show up well.“We want to do well in it and I think we can.“I thought our fitness was a big factor against St Johnstone.“We had a hard pre-season and I think we got the benefits of that against St Johnstone because we finished the game strongly and looked the fitter team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/SNS-15266913-Dundee-United-v-Dunfermline.jpg-e1534240458997-820x564.jpg ","title":"el bakhtaoui speaks of frustration at not playing in right position at dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s Faissal El Bakhtaoui is convinced he can still make it in the Premiership but is happy to have the chance to prove himself all over again at Dunfermline.The Frenchman left Tayside for the Pars on a season-long loan after becoming increasingly frustrated with his lack of game-time at Dens Park.The 25-year-old scored eight times in 66 appearances for the Dark Blues after joining from Dunfermline in 2016 but failed to scale the heights he did with the Pars first time round.The striker insists his opportunities in the central striking role were all too rare under Neil McCann and this term was unlikely to be any better.Now the former futsal star, who joined Dunfermline as a complete unknown in 2012, is desperate to breathe new life into his career in familiar surroundings.Speaking ahead of last night\u0026#8217s Irn-Bru Cup clash away to Inverness Caley Thistle, he said: “I have come back a better player, with more experience. I learned so much in the Premiership, even though I was a bit frustrated at Dundee.“I think I can play at that level but it just didn’t happen for me.

dundee midfielder spence","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStraight-Talking Lewis Spence insists it’s only a matter of time before Dundee’s form in front of goal turns around, saying “some team is going to take a battering” from them soon.The 22-year-old is hoping that’s today as Ayr United come calling in the Betfred Cup last 16 at Dens Park.Although he’s backing his team-mates to start putting away the chances they are creating, he knows just how tough the Honest Men will be to get past.Dundee will have to keep an eye on dangerman striker Lawrence Shankland.He said: “It’s going to come, our luck has to change some time because we are getting the chances.“I think some team is going to take a battering soon, we’ll take three or four off somebody, and hopefully that might be this weekend.“It’ll be a really tough game, though, Ayr are no pushovers, I know a few of their players and they are a decent team.“They play some good stuff and have goalscorers in their team so it’ll be tough.“They won League One so they’ve come up with confidence and have goals in their team, boys that can put it in the net.“They’ll come here with confidence but we’re confident we can get the job done if we apply ourselves the right way professionally.“I’ve always said we want a cup run here to give the fans something back and this is a great draw for us.“It’ll be difficult but we win that and we’re in the quarters and a decent draw can see you to the semis at Hampden.“However, we need to take care of Ayr first – we can’t look past them.”Spence was an injury doubt for this one after he was subbed in last weekend’s 1-0 defeat at home to Aberdeen with an ankle knock. He says, though, coming off was just a precaution after needing surgery on the same ankle last season.He said: “It was nothing too serious. I had a shot and rolled my ankle a bit and I’ve had previous with it, so it was a bit of a worry at the time. However, a good bit of rest and the physio saw it. I’ve trained this week and it’s good. I just need to keep an eye on it.”Now would be an unfortunate time for Spence to be ruled out of action after some impressive displays in the early-season games and particularly due to the level of competition in the position now at Dens Park.“Last year there were a lot of centre-mids but again this year we’re very strong there, one of the strongest areas in the team,” he added.“I think that’s good because it keeps everyone on their toes, you can’t slack because there will be somebody else to take your place.“I believe in my ability and I’ve worked hard over the summer, worked hard in pre-season, too.“Obviously, I’ve been in the position but Glen Kamara is to come back and you’ve got Adil Nabi, Paul McGowan, Elton Ngwatala and Kharl Madianga, so there’s a lot of competition in there. I think throughout the season it will be getting rotated round and, hopefully, I can be in that team.“I think I’ve done OK so far. It’s still early but I want to keep this up through the whole season.“Last year I played well in stages and then got injured so I want to play consistently every week, play as much as I can, and obviously help the team climb the table.”And the way to do that will be to start finding the net, something Spence is adamant that’ll change soon.“I think our luck will turn around.“We have to put some of these chances away, we all know that, but the main thing is we are creating chances.“One day it is going to click, something is just missing at the moment but we all believe in the guys up front to go and do it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b769ff279716.jpg ","title":"too many people have jumped witnesses recall horror as man stands close to edge of tay road bridge","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWitnesses have spoken about the horror of seeing the police incident that closed Tay Road Bridge yesterday.The bridge was shut in both directions yesterday amid fears for the safety of a man seen standing close to the edge.Police, the fire service, the coastguard and Broughty Ferry lifeboat were all on the scene, with the bridge closing at around 4am.The man was about a third of the way along the bridge, from the Fife side.Traffic was being diverted via Perth and the A90, with queues beginning to build up around 8.30am.However, some motorists had stopped and parked near the bridge entrance on the Dundee side as the drama unfolded.Ross Mackenzie, an apprentice bricklayer with building firm Panbride Contracts in Carnoustie, was on his way to St Andrews for work around 7.30am when police stopped his van to tell him the bridge was closed.The 25-year-old said he hoped the man could be brought to safety.He said: “We got here and were told we couldn’t get over the bridge. We thought about driving the Perth way to Fife but decided just to see how it goes and hopefully the bridge reopens soon.“We were told it’s someone at the side of the bridge and there’s concern for their safety.“Whoever it is, I hope they can be talked down.“Too many people have jumped from it.”A dog walker, who asked not to be named, said she thought there had been a road traffic collision initially.“The road closes for crashes all the time so that’s your first thought,” she said.“Then I noticed the lifeboat and realised there must be either someone in the water or fears they were going to jump.“It’s just terrible someone would want to do that.

His only previous start was in the 1-0 win at Dundee last December, the game after he scored a superb free-kick in a 2-1 loss to Rangers.The Dons made their intentions clear straight from the kick-off when Gary Mackay-Steven found Stevie May with a cross from the right flank.Striker May fired off a 10 yard shot that keeper Craig Samson pushed wide for a corner.There were just nine seconds on the clock.Moments later midfielder Stephen Gleeson fired a 22 yard free kick over the bar.In the fifth minute the highly dangerous Mackay-Steven picked out Lewis Ferguson at the back post but his diving header was saved for a corner.Straight after Dominic Ball met a Frank Ross corner with a glancing header that Ferguson got a toe onto only to see the effort flash inches wide.Again in the 10th minute Mackay-Steven was provider when his drifted corner from the right found Mikey Devlin who headed across goal from 18 yards and wide.Aberdeen could, and should, have been two or three up inside the first 10 minutes.St Mirren finally mustered an effort in the 13th minute when Nicolai Brock-Madsen headed wide.Aberdeen\u0026#8217s deserved opener came in the 15th minute when a pass from Ferguson found MACKAY-STEVEN who took it on the volley.The winger smashed the ball into the ground from just inside the box and it bounced over keeper Samson.The Dons were tearing St Mirren apart.It was 2-0 in the 19th minute when the sensational Mackay-Steven raced past Hayden Coulson and captain Graeme SHINNIE powered in on the blindside at the back post to head in.St Mirren looked shell-shocked and were hugely fortunate to just be two goals down after only 20 minutes.The rout continued when it became 3-0 in the 26th minute when Wright pounced on a poor clearance from keeper SamsonHe rounded the keeper and then unselfishly squared a pass along the face of goal to Stevie MAY who clinically fired in from 12 yards.It was May\u0026#8217s first competitive goal for the Dons since a 4-1 win over St Johnstone on March 31.In the 36th minute Ball picked out Shinnie at the edge of the box and his dipping header went just over.Yet again Mackay-Steven was in the heart of the action when he skipped past Coulson then unleashed a low drive from 12 yards that keeper Samson did well to block at the near post.On the stroke of half-time Shinnie had a 12 yard drive blocked by Samson.It was the final action of a superb 45 minute shift from the Dons who received a deserved standing ovation from the Red Army at half-time.It was 4-0 in the 56th minute when Aberdeen were awarded a penalty when Mackay-Steven was taken down by Coulson as he attempted to step past him.The left-back had no answer for MACKAY-STEVEN who then stepped up to take the penalty \u0026#8211 and converted.In the 81st minute Shinnie curled a 22 yard shot inches wide of the far corner with keeper Samson beaten.Moments later teenage substitute Bruce Anderson volleyed from distance forcing keeper Samson to push wide.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Ball, Devlin, Considine, Shinnie, Gleeson, Ferguson, McGinn, Mackay-Steven, Wright, May.Subs: Forrester (for  Ross 60), Anderson (for Wright 70), McLennan (for May 80)Subs not used: Cerny,  Cosgrove, Campbell,  Roscoe.ST MIRREN: Samson, P.

Stubbs was later sacked after five months in the job.Ball said: “Alan Stubbs helped get the best out of me. He had me playing midfield and at centre-half and gave me those options.“It was good for me as were his man-management and the way he develops players.“Having played for him at Rotherham, I know that St Mirren will be very organised.“St Mirren have started well and have a new manager so it will be a tough game.“It is a cup game and in those matches it is always about who is best on the day and we need to make sure it is us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"what do you get inside scotlands baby box1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEvery newborn baby in Scotland in entitled to receive a free baby box.Each box, featuring a design by Leanne Young, contains a selection of clothes \u0026#8211 from newborn to six month \u0026#8211 as well as vital everyday items, including travel changing mat, a bib and a bath towel.They even include a poem, a couple of books, a bath/room thermometer and a digital ear thermometer.The box itself even doubles a first bed for your baby \u0026#8211 coming with a mattress, protector, fitted sheet and a blanket.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b727f6c95f80-e1534249020890-830x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen girl returns home after undergoing 19k operation to help her walk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA north-east youngster has returned home after undergoing major surgery to help her walk unaided.Olivia Brands, who has cerebral palsy, was in Bristol for five weeks following two operations.The nine-year-old from Kincorth, underwent Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR), a £19,000 procedure only done in selected hospitals, as well as tendon lengthening, which was designed to make her more flexible.Mum Senga Brands, 40, was with her all the way, alongside husband Steven, 36.The operations have been successful, though it will take time for the full effects of the procedures to show.The family came home on Saturday to see their front door decorated with balloons.Senga said: “My next-door neighbour did all that. Olivia was really chuffed about it.“It did feel a little weird coming home, just because we know that everything is going to be different.”Olivia was reunited with her two sisters, Taylor and Billie, after five weeks apart.Senga said: “My other two girls were at home for five weeks, and we’re just trying to get back into the routine of spending time together as a family.“She’s really loved it, I can’t get peace and quiet now. But it’s been great for her to spend time with her little sister, and she’s happy to have them back.”The youngster was given the prognosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of 14 months – the neurological condition causes constant stiffness and tightness of leg and arm muscles, making mobility difficult.The family had previously thought treatment in the US was the only option and had set about raising £70,000 when they received the good news that Olivia had been deemed an ideal candidate for the operation in Bristol.Olivia is currently gearing up to go back to school next Tuesday.Senga hopes that she’ll be ready to go back with her classmates, and says they’ll “play it by ear” for the first few weeks.She said: “We’ll just need to see how she gets on, and if she needs to reduce her time at school then that’s what we’ll do.”Senga hopes that the surgery will now make Olivia able to do things that her friends and classmates can.She said: “So much has changed for her, she can sit on a bench now, she can sit crossed legged, it doesn’t sound like a big thing, but it is for her.“It’s little steps, and it’s good for her that she can be part of that.“I know that sitting on a bench isn’t a big thing, but her sitting with her classmates is a big thing for her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b752334e0906-884x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen sandwich shop cleans up with glowing report1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen sandwich shop that was criticised by inspectors earlier this year has now been given a glowing report.Aberdeen City Council sent an inspector for a routine check of Deja Vu food shop on Rose Street in March and their report said improvement was needed.The inspector expressed concern about the condition of some of the equipment and cleanliness.Several insects were spotted in the back kitchen area, which is not used for food preparation.The business’s owner, Roy Duncan, said he immediately called in pest controllers and the insects were removed within hours.He added that he spoke with the council inspectors in depth so he was able to attend to their concerns.According to the council, the premises was re-inspected on June 8 and they gave it a pass rating – meaning that all the original concerns had been dealt with.Mr Duncan, who has been in the food trade for 30 years, said: “It was quite a shock because, having been in the trade for so long, I had always passed these inspections and known exactly what gets you a pass and what doesn’t. I was surprised.“I also disagreed with what the council said. They made out there were a lot of insects in the kitchen where we make food, but it was two insects in a back room.“They would have come in during a food delivery and it was an isolated incident – one we sorted out right away.”Mr Duncan said he was delighted to have passed the latest inspection and was looking forward to getting things back on track.“It was a bit of a setback, but we’re pleased it’s behind us now.“Our food tastes great and we have a wide range of dishes for people to sample.“I have a great team of staff and we love our customers calling in.“I hope that more people will come in over the coming days and weeks to see what we have to offer.”Mr Duncan added: “I am proud to run the business and always welcome customer feedback.“We pride ourselves on offering delicious food people want.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"baby boxes first birthday","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAlmost 6,000 baby boxes have been received by new parents in the north-east.As the Baby Box initiative celebrates its first birthday this week, new figures have shown that 5,932 families across the NHS Grampian area have had boxes delivered to them in the past year.The number of boxes received in the area ranks third in the country, behind NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lothian.What do you get inside Scotland\u0026#8217s baby box?A Scottish Government scheme, it includes a number of essential items for parents and babies, while the box itself can be used as a safe sleeping place.Children and early years minister Maree Todd said: “A year on from when the first Baby Boxes were delivered, we can say these boxes are having a real impact on the lives of those who receive them.“These boxes demonstrate that, as a society, we value each and every child in Scotland.

House Veterinary Hospital in Kingswells.Two of the units would be used by drive-thru customers as well as those sitting in.The applicant has not yet said which companies would occupy the units.The application was considered at a meeting of Kingswells Community Council (KCC) on Monday.Afterwards, KCC secretary Ian Cox said: “We will be objecting to the application.“One of the reasons is because of the issue of access to the vets.”In a letter to the local authority, KCC said: “The access to the vet from Kingswells will be via the AWPR roundabout.“At peak times this will significantly increase travel times and could have significant effects on a sick pet.”Mr Cox also said he believes the scheme would contradict an area masterplan.“We worked with Prime Four to develop a masterplan for that site,” said Mr Cox.He added: “It was all supposed to be high-quality, high-class type buildings, and we don’t think this fits into that.”A report sent to the council on behalf of the applicants said: “The sale of food and drink for consumption on the premises would serve Prime Four workers, Kingswells’ residents and people working at and visiting the new Aberdeen Football Club stadium – all within easy walking distance of the site.”KCC said it is concerned the safety of football fans could be at risk if large numbers of them walk along the A944 from Kingswells park-and-ride to the stadium, as they might spill out on to the road.“Approval of this application could have major implications to the safety of football fans,” its letter to the council adds.No Kingsford Stadium, a group opposed to the new football ground, has said the charity it has set up, called West Aberdeen Environmental Protection, will formally object to the application.“These drive-thru outlets are another gateway application, an attempt by developers to get a further foothold on greenspace in order to develop the north and south sides of the A944 from Kingswells to Westhill.“The threat to the green belt and

Ardene House Veterinary Hospital director Mark Bayliss, who said: “I welcome the addition of a local amenity.“At present there is little variety or availability of food at lunchtime.“This new food outlet area will be a welcome addition for all local staff and people using the new bypass.”CAF Properties (SABC) declined to comment.Its report to ACC said: “The proposed development makes a positive

John Minton’s Landscape and Windmill.The oil on canvas artwork, which dates back to 1945, was purchased by the Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums team with assistance from the National Fund for Acquisitions in 1977.Landscape and Windmill dates back to the year of Minton’s first solo exhibition in London.He was a prolific draughtsman and illustrator and also designed posters, wallpapers and

Eventually I joined my local running club and I have been doing it ever since.”The Crathes Castle half marathon, which has attracted top Scotland international runners such as Robbie Simpson in recent years, has been saved by a new sponsorship deal.PIM, an Aberdeenshire-based integrity management company, swooped in with an offer to sponsor the race after seeing a Facebook post highlighting that the event might not take place.Now,with the support of the new backers, the National Trust for Scotland is adding a 1.5km cross country run for primary school-aged children to the event programme, which is on Saturday September 15.Martin Worth, director at PIM, said: “We’re delighted to be able to step in and work with the National Trust for Scotland to ensure that this well-known, local event takes place.“It’s also fantastic to play a role in encouraging the next generation of runners to get their trainers on and enjoy the great outdoors with the introduction of the children’s run.“As a company, we are running a health campaign throughout 2018 and some of our staff will be taking up the additional challenge to run the PIM half marathon.”Scotland international Fiona Brian set a women’s course record time of 1hr 22min 59secs in last year’s race while Great Britain ultra trail running representative Kyle Greig won the men’s event in 1:12:18.Brian is unable to compete this year but her clubmate Sarah Milne, winner of last month’s Chapelton of Elsick 10km, is among the leading women entrants so far.Greig is unsure as to whether he will be able to defend his title at the moment and will make a late decision.Entries, which close on September 8, can be made at www.nts.org.uk/visit/events/the-pim-half-marathon-at-crathes-castle-1\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/07/18, 3:43 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.It was a case of \u0026#8216all\u0026#8217s well that ends well\u0026#8217 for young Adam in the Furnace hills last week.Police officers and his mum left him in no doubt of how narrow an escape he had.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK. The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops.

It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The pitch at the school is too small to host even an under-13 game.‘For Mid Argyll Rugby Club to grow, it needs to have a home to create an identity. In recent years, plans and promises to create a rugby facility have always come to nothing and the game in Mid Argyll has suffered for it.\u0026#8216We have a Scottish School cup game on Tuesday August 28 and at the moment we are still looking for a venue.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey.

The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.  But they were criticised by Prestonpans Community Council, which said merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation the local authority announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year stating \"the majority of respondents said that they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the Library building.\"  However the council has now said that following a service review\u0026nbspit will move a wide range of services into the library from Monday, August 27.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

She told the Courier: \u0026ldquoIt was an amazing experience with half of Manchester out cheering everyone on.  \u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was fantastic, and I think due to the anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing, there seemed to be an extra sense of \u0026lsquocoming together\u0026rsquo in the city.  Jane was inspired to take on the run by Eliza McKinney, a girl from North Berwick who has Rett Syndrome and whose family have taken on a number of fundraisers to help find a cure.  Jane said that the seven-year-old was \u0026ldquoamazingly brave and, on her JustGiving page, added: \u0026ldquoShe is part of the reason I started running \u0026ndash her bravery, determination and smile inspired me to try and do something to help find a way to help children with this incredibly debilitating, life-altering condition.  Jane told the Courier she was pleased that the money raised was going towards \u0026ldquogroundbreaking work to find a cure for the condition, which mainly affects young girls.  She also picked out her highlight of the run, saying: \u0026ldquoWe all made it across the finish line and got our medals, which was brilliant, but for me the best part of the day was seeing Amber smile and come to life when she recognised part of the route.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"catriona-matthew-brings-solheim-cup-to-north-berwick","story":"  Matthew will captain the European team for the event \u0026ndash the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup \u0026ndash and was in her home town on Monday to start the countdown.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8207400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.  The new nursery, which saw more than 200 interested parents attend its open day last month, could employ up to 30 staff when it is at capacity, with six already recruited.  Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.  The new nursery, which features a giant indoor sandpit and separate baby unit with a sensory room and quiet areas, was officially opened by East Lothian MSP Iain Gray on Thursday, July 26.  He said: \u0026ldquoPear Tree Nursery has been doing a great job for many Haddington families in recent years \u0026ndash including my own grandsons. I have seen for myself on lots of occasions the great atmosphere in the existing nursery, and have watched that reflected in the many national awards Pear Tree has won for the quality of their provision.  \u0026ldquoI was delighted to help open the new Pear Tree on West Road. This is a beautiful building and it has been fitted out to provide the best of care. Not only will it increase the availability of childcare, but it will create a significant number of new jobs in the town too.  \u0026ldquoThis is now a highly qualified and professional sector, and Pear Tree has a great track record on staff support and training, so these are excellent opportunities for local people.  \u0026ldquoWith childcare entitlement expanding and Haddington also increasing in size, this is a much-needed and welcome facility."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.

The Gannett Foundation UK, which makes the grants, has given more than \u0026pound3 million to help charitable community causes all over Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the last 10 years.  One of the successful applicants last year was Lothian Autistic Society, which received \u0026pound5,000 for its East Lothian Basecamp service. This service supports children, aged 5-13, with autism and helps them develop social communication and social interaction skills through structured themed group and play sessions.  The foundation supports charities with projects which take a creative approach to fundamental issues such as education and neighbourhood improvements, economic development, youth development, local problem-solving, assistance to the disadvantaged or disabled, environmental conservation and cultural enrichment.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263378.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations.

The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather.

Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe call it Sunny Dunny. It is a sunny, cheerful, caring place \u0026ndash within the classrooms, corridors and out in the community.  \u0026ldquoWhen parents come in, they are so friendly and supportive as well.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, East Lothian Council spokeswoman for education and children\u0026rsquos services, welcomed the new headteacher.  She said: \u0026ldquoI wish Claire Slowther all the best in her role as headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School. It\u0026rsquos a great time to lead the school into their new building and facilities.  \u0026ldquoI know she will ensure with her team that pupils at the school will receive a great school experience, done in the Dunbar way."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6969098.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"call-for-new-state-energy-company-to-be-based-at-cockenzie","story":"  Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council is preparing to publish a document outlining its views for the future use of the site, which supports the vision put forward in a masterplan produced following public consultation.  And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263580.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mr Coveney said Mr Annan had a dedicated interest in Ireland and the maintenance of peace on the island, commentating as recently as April on the Agreement and its legacy.

The council said it is the first local authority in the UK to offer free sanitary provision in all of its public buildings.  It comes after the local authority introduced free sanitary products in its secondary schools last August, with young women accessing more than 13,000 free sanitary towels and tampons while at school in the last year.  Council leader Joe Cullinane said: \"Sanitary products are a necessity, not a choice. I wish for no women or girl here in North Ayrshire to find themselves in the embarrassing and often degrading situation of having to use improper sanitary protection simply because they cannot afford it.  \"After all, periods are not exempt from poverty - they don\u0027t take account of what is in your pocket or purse.

For they and their true loves - as the band\u0026rsquos floorfilling cover nearly goes - will never meet again.  The six-piece has sold 47,000 tickets for farewell concerts in Stirling today and tomorrow that will bring down the curtain on 45 years of their groundbreaking brand of Celtic folk rock.  Their fans - many in the Hebrides - have struggled to afford or arrange the journey with Calmac warning ferries were full and extra flights from the islands put on to cater for extra demand.  Against a backdrop of Stirling Castle, Runrig will perform, for just two last times, what amounts soundtrack of the last few turbulent decades of Scottish history, through two devolution referendums and 2014\u0026rsquos big vote.  The group - despite some changed faces - says it has a special bond with its fans, many of whom were enjoying rock in their own language for the first time. But the time, the musicians said, had come to bow out.  Vocalist Bruce Guthro said: \u0026ldquoI think we\u0026rsquore ready. I think we\u0026rsquore very proud of what we\u0026rsquove accomplished and we\u0026rsquore ready to give Scotland the show of a lifetime.  The Canadian, who has been touring with Runrig for 20 years, said of his time with the group: \u0026ldquoAll of it has been special. It\u0026rsquos almost impossible to pick certain highlights - it\u0026rsquos just been a great journey.  \u0026ldquoThe fans are are a family unto themselves and they are without question the driving force behind this band.  Since forming on Skye in 1973, Runrig have produced 14 studio albums and performed at Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Albert Hall and in New York\u0026rsquos Times Square.  They are hailed for their contribution to Scottish music, the Gaelic language and Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural identity. Though they were never entirely happy to be seen as a kitsch symbol of Scottishness.    Founding member Rory MacDonald said it is a love of performing that has kept the group going through the decades.  The bass player said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tended just to go from album to album, we\u0026rsquove never had a grand plan, or the idea we\u0026rsquore going to take over the world - none of that stuff.  \u0026ldquoVery early on, maybe after the third album, we knew very much that this was what we wanted to do with our lives. It wasn\u0026rsquot for fame or fortune, it was just that we loved playing music and playing together.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove always had that sense of being comfortable with what we\u0026rsquore doing. That\u0026rsquos the way it has worked for us.  Guitarist Malcolm Jones added: \u0026ldquoIf you\u0026rsquod said then that 45 years later we\u0026rsquod still be doing this, you\u0026rsquod have thought no way, not a chance.  Jones said concerts - called Last Dance - marked the end of an era for the band but other projects would continue, including looking after the group\u0026rsquos legacy.  Keyboard player Brian Hurren admitted there has been nerves ahead of the final concerts.  He said: \u0026ldquoI would say it\u0026rsquos unlike any other show I\u0026rsquove experienced with the band. I\u0026rsquove had sleepless nights and I\u0026rsquove had elation and excitement, sadness - everything. It\u0026rsquos been an incredible journey.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of fans that can\u0026rsquot get to see us because they\u0026rsquore in Australia or places that are just too far away, but they have been trying to make it over for this show, which is amazing.  Meeting the band ahead of the concerts, Scotland\u0026rsquos Deputy First Minister John Swinney thanked Runrig for their \u0026ldquoextraordinary contribution to Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural life.  He tweeted: \u0026ldquoA very special privilege to thank Runrig1973 on behalf of Scottish Government for all they have done to strengthen Scottish traditional music, the Gaelic language and Scotland in 45 years of amazing music.  \u0026ldquoThey have been such an important part of Scotland\u0026rsquos incredible journey.    Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos SNP colleague Pete Wishart MP formerly played keyboards for the band. Mr Wishart had said he would never join the SNP when interviewed in 1991.  Speaking to writer Peter Ross in last weekend\u0026rsquos Herald Magazine, Mr Wishart stressed his band\u0026rsquos part in helping Scotland learning to love and appreciate a sense of itself as confident and assertive. He added: \u0026ldquoAll the other political changes could never have happened without a feeling that what we have in Scotland is important and worth celebrating.  The band did not write Loch Lomond.

Indicted on charges of espionage, links to terrorist organisations and collaborating with a Muslim sect to overthrow the Turkish government, Andrew Brunson, has soured relations between Ankara and Washington and plunged Turkey into a currency crisis.  Ever since his arrest in 2016 this middle-aged evangelical American pastor and missionary has not only become something of a martyr in the eyes of the US Christian right, but more recently a convenient cause celebre for US President Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence, the latter sharing Mr Brunson\u0026rsquos evangelical faith.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspTurkey, Trump and Brexit continue to weigh on stocks and pound  The story of Andrew Brunson\u0026rsquos journey to the epicentre of the current diplomatic crisis between the US and Turkey is a peculiar one.  Prior to his arrest Mr Brunson who is originally from North Carolina, ran the small Church of the Resurrection in the western Turkish city of Izmir.  Arrested in the aftermath of the 2016 attempted coup against Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he was accused of working with the Fethullah Gulen network, a movement supporting the US-based Turkish cleric that is widely believed to have orchestrated the attempted putsch.  He is also accused of assisting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which both Ankara and Washington list as a \u0026ldquoterrorist organisation.  As Mr Brunson\u0026rsquos cause was subsequently picked up by evangelicals in the US, political pressure began to grow, and Washington attempted to cut a deal with Turkey, the Trump administration subsequently dissuading Congress from immediate sanctions on Ankara.  By September of last year though, Mr Erdogan sought to use the pastor as a bargaining chip in Ankara\u0026rsquos long-running battle to secure the extradition of alleged coup plotter Mr Gulen.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspIn the shadow of Erdogan -\u0026nbspinterview with Turkish theatre director Murat Daltaban  \u0026ldquoYou have a pastor too, the Turkish president told the Americans. \u0026ldquoGive him to us. Then we will try Brunson and give him to you.  The Trump administration refused to play on the deal and dug in its heels. The culmination has been the current spat that has divided two Nato members, caused a war of words between two firebrand presidents, and seen the Turkish economy plummet.  Right now this is how the situation stands, and on the face of it, Mr Brunson remains seemingly at the core of the crisis. But there are other much deeper diplomatic, geo-political and economic factors at play here too.  Last week Mr Erdogan in a New York Times op-ed outlined his country\u0026rsquos grievances toward the US, making clear that unilateral actions against Ankara by Washington would only undermine American interests and force Turkey to look for other friends and allies elsewhere.  It was a scarcely veiled threat and one that did not go down well at the White House. It came too against a backdrop of even more complex tensions between the two nations.  Chief among these are arms deals, sanctions on Iran and Turkey\u0026rsquos increasingly ambivalent role in the US and western fight against the self proclaimed Islamic State (IS|) group in Syria.  To take the arms deals first, right now Washington is none to happy at Ankara\u0026rsquos plans to buy the S-400 advanced air-defence system from Russia.  Should Turkey do so, it would mean it both operating the F-35, the newest high-tech jet in the American military inventory, while depending on Russia for maintenance and spare parts for the S-400.  Such a scenario would put Moscow in the position to glean valuable intelligence on how to detect the US plane. Already Turkey has paid $1billion for the aircraft, but a delegation of US senators told Mr Erdogan in no uncertain terms during a visit to Ankara last month that the US Congress would block the transfer of the F-35s if his country deployed the Russian S-400.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspHeavy equipment brought in to move rubble from Genoa bridge collapse  The tension with the US around the arms deals issue has only been compounded of course by Mr Erdogan\u0026rsquos increasing diplomatic courting of Russia and threats to Washington of looking for allies elsewhere.  Which brings us then to the second of the three main grievances between the two countries, sanctions imposed on Iran. With the Trump administration having declared it will block any country that defies the measures it has recently taken over renewed sanctions on Iran, Turkey is faced with a difficult decision.  According to analysts at the US based independent intelligence group Stratfor, given that Iran is almost entirely dependent on imports to meet its fossil fuel needs, the return of sanctions on Iranian energy exports will mean either falling in line with the US or facing the consequences from Washington.  Given the current mood between them it\u0026rsquos extremely unlikely that the Trump administration would even consider granting Turkey a waiver to continue importing oil and gas from Iran. Given too that Ankara\u0026rsquos relations with other potential suppliers such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia are so bad, it leaves Mr Erdogan in something of a bind.  Which brings us to the last of the three most pressing issues rankling both countries. For some time now the Turks have been further complicating the US fight against the jihadists of IS by forcing Washington into protracted negotiations on the use of the crucial Incirlik Air Base that sits on Turkish soil.  Even worse, Ankara working in conjunction with Syrian armed Islamist groups, has launched incursions into northern Syria taking cities like Afrin and targeting Washington\u0026rsquos Kurdish allies.  Only this month Amnesty International reported that Turkish forces are giving these same Syrian armed groups free rein to commit serious human rights abuses against civilians in Afrin. For his part too Mr Erdogan has even gone so far as to threaten US troops operational in the area alongside Kurdish forces.  Yesterday against this bitter backdrop Turkey\u0026rsquos battered lira weakened more than 6 per cent against the dollar, after another US warning that Ankara should expect more economic sanctions unless it hands over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson.  Whether Mr Erdogan decides that such a concession is necessary remains to be seen. Even should he make such a gesture though, there is more than enough bad blood between him and Mr Trump to guarantee other and possibly even more serious showdowns ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-why-i-question-the-motives-of-those-who-seek-to-bury-corbyn","story":"  Flowing from this are other principles: that a child has a right to an education and healthcare that is not based on the ability of his family to pay for it and that the innate humanity of the person will be upheld and protected from forces that would seek to erode these. This doesn\u0026rsquot mean that a degree of capitalism or financial speculation isn\u0026rsquot permitted but it does hold that the profit motive can never take precedence over the basic human right to dignity and respect.  Other beliefs in the catechism of the leftie are a little more uncertain and can be subject to the influences of a person\u0026rsquos religious faith or ethnic custom. Indeed the right to practise a religious faith at all and to be permitted to express your ethnic and cultural identity evoke a civilised, enlightened and just society that is at peace with itself. Nor should those rights rest on the mere numbers of those who identify as such.  If you were to unravel the DNA of my own belief structure you would see the ribbons of socialism and Christianity curling round each other as they rise and fall together. Each informs and nourishes the other. Within this too are some beliefs which I suppose would tilt me against those of others in the wider Labour movement. Three immediately spring to mind: my support for an independent Scotland my belief that an unborn child is fully human and thus deserving of protection under the European Convention on Human Rights and my deep affection for the Jewish faith. It\u0026rsquos this faith, after all that underpins everything else. My saviour was born an orthodox Jew, lived as an orthodox Jew and died as one. Without the faith that Jesus lived there would be no Christianity and no salvation.  Labour, though, is a broad church and while I\u0026rsquove enjoyed some robust debates on these issues with leftie chums I\u0026rsquove never felt assailed to the point where I would consider leaving the movement. In any case, they are all subordinate to something bigger and most eloquently articulated in recent years by Jeremy Corbyn and his proclamation \u0026ldquofor the many not the few. It\u0026lsquos best encapsulated by this line from a speech he made at a manufacturing conference in February. \u0026ldquoFor a generation, instead of finance serving industry, politicians have served finance. We\u0026rsquove seen where that ends: the productive economy, our public services and people\u0026rsquos lives being held hostage by a small number of too-big-to-fail banks and casino financial institutions.  My love for Judaism has not blinded me to the actions of the Israeli government in its treatment of Palestinians living on the West Bank. In recent times this has begun once more to be characterised by callousness with the building of illegal settlements in defiance of international law and the recent legislation that effectively makes Palestinians second-class citizens.  Only a fool though would deny though, that some on the left have slaked their malevolent anti-Semitism under the cover of disgust at the actions of the Israeli Government. Part of this is the suggestion that any equivalence between modern Israeli policies and the horrors of the Holocaust is unacceptable. The Nazis engaged in a truly evil project to exterminate an entire race and to wipe all traces of it from the face of the earth. It was fuelled by centuries of fear, suspicion and resentment that relied on our basest human behaviour for its oxygen something that sought to dehumanise this people by mocking their physical appearance their psyche their beliefs and their behaviour. In every country where they appeared they were criminalised good for nothing but making money (we banned them from doing anything else) and when they succeeded at that we dehumanised them further still. Any attempt to understand the conduct of the modern Israeli state can\u0026rsquot begin until you also try to understand what it must feel like to live with such a legacy and to be surrounded by countries whose stated aim is your ultimate annihilation.  I believe Mr Corbyn to be sincere in his aim of eliminating all traces of anti-Semitism from his party and I believe he has made much progress in this. I also accept that he was unwise in choosing to share platforms with people possessing darker motives. Yet, what can we say about the sincerity of those currently trying to destroy him for these? Just as some on the left have used the Palestinian conflict to camouflage their anti-Semitism so too have many on the right deployed a wholly manufactured and insincere horror of anti-Semitism to pursue their own agenda. This carries an iniquity all of its own. When did their purported hatred of anti-Semitism start? Does it extend to the curious pastime of holding Nazi-themed fancy dress parties as favoured by generations of our Royal family and their aristocratic fluffers? Does it include making common cause with far right demagogues who march under the swastika and favour solutions to immigration issues that recall the horrors of the Third Reich? Or does it begin and end merely with destroying a figure whose stated aim is to put an end to your centuries of unearned privileges?  Mr Corbyn still has much to do to rid his party of the anti-Semites and he could do worse than making this the main theme of his closing speech to the party\u0026rsquos autumn conference. In the meantime he needs no lessons from those who have only lately discovered their horror of anti-Semitism."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-nicola-sturgeon-is-running-out-of-time-to-make-her-call-on-indyref2","story":"  Many will be SNP members. Local SNP MPs Stewart Hosie and Chris Law are among those due to attend. But it is not an SNP event.  Instead, it has been organised by the All Under One Banner group, partly out of frustration that Nicola Sturgeon is not being forceful enough in pursuing another vote.  The tensions are such some Yes supporters even plan to demonstrate at the SNP conference in October to exhort the First Minister to use the \u0026lsquotriple-lock\u0026rsquo mandate she says she has to call a referendum by 2021.  At the last SNP conference in June, Ms Sturgeon tried to dampen down calls for a fresh vote, saying the focus should be on converting No voters, not the date. \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos stop obsessing all of the time about when we might get the chance to vote on independence again, she said.  But the obsession never went away. Nor is it really an obsession. It is a completely reasonable thing for Yes supporters to contemplate given that mandate has a limited shelf-life.  But as the former SNP cabinet minister Alex Neil argued this week, the game\u0026rsquos a bogie. Theresa May will never give the Scottish Parliament the power to hold a referendum.  She blanked Holyrood\u0026rsquos request for a so-called Section 30 order before the last general election.  She would certainly do so again, not least because she is now reliant on the ultra-Unionist DUP to stay in power. Even if she were toppled, no new Tory or Labour PM would be any keener to add a fight over Scottish independence to an in-tray already bursting with Brexit.  Impatient Yessers may argue for a unilateral, Catalan-style referendum, and to hell with a Section 30 order.  But besides looking desperate, such a vote is open to legal challenge. A Catalan-style referendum wouldn\u0026rsquot end in independence, it would end in the courts.  Given the improbability of a Section 30 order, it falls to Ms Sturgeon to manage expectations and prepare folk for an anti-climax.  So far she\u0026rsquos kicked the can down the road. After being blindsided by the last election, she \u0026ldquoreset her March 2017 plan for a Brexit-related referendum and promised a new \u0026ldquoprecise timescale this autumn.  Now, with Brexit still a hazy mess, she has hinted she might not have enough information to say anything concrete this autumn after all.  But while kicking the can is a time-honoured political device, Ms Sturgeon is fast running out of road.  There are snap elections, but no snap referendums. Each referendum is governed by its own particular Act of parliament, and that takes time.  There also has to be six-month gap between the legislation and the vote to allow for lead campaign groups to be set up and for a campaign period.  The last independence referendum was governed by a 2013 Holyrood Act which started life a full 18 months before the vote.  READ MORE: British establishment will use dirty tricks to stop independence  Ms Sturgeon published a draft bill for another referendum in October 2016 for a three-month consultation. It is essentially a list of tweaks to the 2013 Act, which was to be used as a template. But it wasn\u0026rsquot introduced at Holyrood, so would still face a parliamentary passage of around nine months - opposition MSPs would be sure to take their time mulling all of the 100 or so variations to the 2013 Act.  The Electoral Commission says a referendum cannot be the same day as the Holyrood election, so we need to work backwards from there to estimate the theoretical deadline for calling one in this parliament.  It would not be spring 2021 in case it became entangled with the Holyrood vote. In 2017, a Tory surge in the local election rolled into a Tory surge at the general\u0026nbspelection. Ms Sturgeon would not want to see a No vote in a referendum snowball into a rout for the SNP at Holyrood.  So the latest practical date for a referendum is likely to be autumn 2020. But, critically, this would have to be preceded by 15 to 18 months of legislation and campaigning. That means Ms Sturgeon would have to start the ball rolling by the middle of next year to hold one, in theory.  So if, by summer 2019, she hasn\u0026rsquot called for a second referendum (albeit probably in vain), it will be obvious to all that it isn\u0026rsquot happening.  If she pretended otherwise and insisted it was still a live possibility she would be accused of treating people like fools who couldn\u0026rsquot read a calendar or do basic arithmetic.  Similarly, if she demanded a referendum at the end of the electoral cycle, it would be seen as a naked gimmick to gee up support for the SNP going into 2021.  She could, in theory, activate her draft referendum bill sooner without actually, calling for vote, introducing it to parliament as a \u0026lsquocontingency measure\u0026rsquo if needed.  She would have to leave the date blank, however. Theresa May tried that with the EU Withdrawal Bill, which initially referred to \u0026ldquoexit day. But after much criticism about this being weak, dodgy and ridiculous, the government included the date. If Ms Sturgeon tried the same trick, she would risk the same accusations of weakness, flakiness and abuse of process.  She would also be reminded Alex Salmond named the day of the 2014 referendum when he introduced the associated bill at Holyrood.  The First Minister\u0026rsquos headache is that if she comes out and declares a second referendum dead in this parliament, she risks antagonising an awful lot of Yes supporters who were counting on her to deliver it. Some might even have believed that \u0026lsquotriple-lock\u0026rsquo mandate stuff.  There would be recriminations, accusations she let the side down, gave up too soon, squandered her chance, blinked first against one of the weakest PMs in British history.  Internal party discipline would fray. It would also be hard to go into 2021 asking for a fresh mandate after admitting she couldn\u0026rsquot cash in the last one. But pretence risks antagonising people too. SNP members would not appreciate being left looking daft on a hill they had followed her half- way up.  Coming clean is the better option. It\u0026rsquos not a good look for a leader, especially one proposing a bold new destiny, to let drift and inertia make the decision for her. A shrug and \u0026lsquoOh, would you look at the time?\u0026rsquo isn\u0026rsquot quite as inspiring as \u0026lsquoFreedom!\u0026rsquo  She can\u0026rsquot keep everyone happy.

In the years that followed, he clashed with the Blair government and the US administration of George Bush over the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 9:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Saturday 18 Aug 2018 9:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Saturday 18 Aug 2018 9:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Saturday 18 Aug 2018 9:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 9:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre. Their volunteers have worked really hard to achieve this. We are delighted to see this investment in their project, which recognises a very important aspect of the heritage of our area.\"Saturday 18 Aug 2018 9:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 9:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

This would be an organisation of first recourse that could advocate and lobby for the town and for what the town deserves.\"Mr Murray will talk about the plans at a business breakfast being held at Ross County Football Club.He added: \"Dingwall is a market town and we should develop and promote it as such to maximise every single opportunity available that can make a profit for our businesses and allow the town to thrive.\"People should be able to make a good living in their home town, and currently there is a feeling that despite serious setbacks, like parking charges, we are moving in the right direction.\"One of the big myths about Bid schemes is that they exist to tell businesses what to do.\"On the contrary, it is for businesses to tell us what they need done.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down. It keeps bursting and they keep fixing it. It\u0026rsquos a nuisance and it\u0026rsquos been happening more and more often over the last few years.

We\u0026rsquore also a bit concerned about the asbestos in the pipe. There are also patches all the way down the road. One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 9:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"various apprenticeships ","story":" Radar Technician – SERCO – Unst\nApprenticeship vacancies are open to male and female applicants, candidates over age 25 will be considered for some vacancies.\nWages vary dependent on employer.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSaturday 18 Aug 2018 9:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SKYE-V-KYLES-10.jpg","title":"highland exodus to stirling as runrig get set for final","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nAfter 45 years, Runrig will bring the curtain down on a remarkable musical career this weekend when they play their last ever shows.\nAn exodus of west Highland and islanders will be among the throng at Stirling’s City Park in the shadow of the town’s famous castle this Friday and Saturday.\nThey will be there to enjoy and celebrate one final time with a band which owes its roots to Skye and North Uist, and became an international flag bearer for Gaeldom’s language and tradition.\nSpeaking to the Free Press ahead of the ‘Last Dance’ shows, guitarist Malcolm Jones said he held conflicting feelings but there was excitement none the less at a final performance which will chart over four decades of music.\nHe added: “I would say we’re all approaching these final concerts with mixed emotions. There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f-jpg.jpg","title":"65470  ","story":"    \nNORTHERN Ireland have been crowned World Champions after the local sailors took on the best from around the world for the Atlantic Challenge and won.\nTeams of young people from around the globe converged on Lough Neagh for the toughest test of endurance, strength and skill.\nThe Northern Ireland crew had an outstanding week in Antrim, with big wins in the two Jackstay Transfer tasks, traditional rope work, man overboard and the rowing slalom races.

Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects. However, there is still much more work to be done. For children like Mark, who have complex congenital heart disease, treatment can be much more difficult.\n  \nMairead, Mark and his family are keen to raise as much awareness and funds as possible and are asking everyone to support in any way they can. You can donate to Mairead or Mark in person or call into any of the following businesses in Ballymena: The Moat Bar, Kockeden Lodge, Credit Union, Willy Allen’s Butchers, The Mace, Ballykeel Chemist, Molly Malone’s Chip Shop and A Star Valeting and Detailing, Ballymena who are running a special offer between August 16 and September 16 - offering full valets for just \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound70 for jeeps and 4x4\u0027s, \u0026pound2 of every full valet will be donated to the cause.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921264.jpg--.jpg?1534230306000\n","title":"plans to extend public realm scheme to greenvale street","story":"  \nPLANS are being considered to extend the Public Realm Scheme to Greenvale Street in Ballymena Town Centre.\n  \nHowever, one local business owner who has been based on the street for 20 years, has hit out at the lack of consultation around the proposals.\n  \nClaire Brennan of Oasis Hair Salon claims she has had to rely on “hearsay” in a bid to find out more about the plans.\n  \nNIE is currently carrying out utility works on the street which is expected to last four weeks.\n  \nClaire said: “I have heard that after the four weeks they are planning to rip the entire street up and replace it as part of the Public Realm Scheme. I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay.

Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602191.1534343875!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising in memory of elizabeth","story":"\nElizabeth Adams was an employee of Mountvale Private Nursing Home, Dromore for over 11 years, she was a work colleague but mainly a friend.  \n\n                \nAfter a short illness called Sarcoidosis, she passed away peacefully on January 15.

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tribute call for elisha scott","story":"\n\nTHE\n public vote to name the new road leading to the Olympia Leisure Centre in Belfast is in its final week and SDLP Councillor Donal Lyons is encouraging people to ensure they have their say and to vote for \u0026#8216Elisha Scott Boulevard\u0026#8217.\n\nElisha Scott is a Liverpool football legend and was Belfast Celtic’s most successful manager who also took the club on their tour of the US in 1949 where they defeated the then British champions, Scotland.\n\nCllr Donal Lyons said: “The vote to name this new road closes on this Sunday and the 125th anniversary of Elisha Scott’s birth will be on the 24th of this month, just days after. \n\n“I’m glad that my proposal to name this road after Elisha Scott has been included because despite Elisha being one of the most successful footballers to have come from our city, awareness of his achievements has faded. \n\n“It’s my hope, that by naming this road after Elisha Scott that we can correct this and begin to give him the full and long overdue recognition he deserves.”\n\nGoalkeeper Scott was born just yards from this new road. Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belleek firm marks papal visit with special souvenirs","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"service to mark anniversary of ballygawley bus bombing","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They had been en route to their Omagh base after returning from leave.\n\nAs they passed through the townland of Curr in the early hours of August 20, the Provisional IRA detonated a 200lb bomb which had been planted in a nearby vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\u0027It\u0027s getting harder to live with as time goes by. I have flashbacks\u0027\n\n\n\n\n \n\u0027It was like watching a horror film slowly unfold\u0027\n\n\n\n\n \n\u0027Why did they lose their lives in such a way? It\u0027s inhuman\u0027\n \n\n\n\nThe force of the explosion hurled the bus 30 metres down the road, threw soldiers into neighbouring fields and left a six-foot crater behind it, scattering wreckage at least 100 yards.\n\nShortly afterwards the Provisionals claimed responsibility, saying its Tyrone \u0027brigade\u0027 carried out the attack and adding: \"We will not lay down our arms until the peace of a British disengagement from Ireland.\"\n\nMany families and individuals connected with the soldiers\u0027 regiment will return to Omagh this weekend to remember those murdered.\n\nThe services and events, which come days after this week\u0027s commemorations for the 1998 Omagh bomb, have been planned by South East Fermanagh Foundation (SEFF), a local victims\u0027 support organisation which has worked collaboratively with Ballygawley residents over the years.\n\nSEFF has supported the return of the families to the scene where their lives forever changed to mark the 30th anniversary - both those who lost their lives and those who were and remain affected by the attack.\n\nAt 10am, survivors and relatives of the soldiers who lost their lives will attend a ceremony held at the site, where there will be an opportunity for wreaths and poppy crosses bearing messages to be laid.\n\nA replacement memorial and panels explaining what occurred on the Co Tyrone road in 1988 will also be dedicated during the hour-long service, organised by SEFF.\n\nThis will be followed by a morning prayer service in Newtownsaville Church of Ireland at 11.30am. This will include a special act of remembrance in respect of those murdered on August 20, 1988, prayers for their families and for the surviving injured.\n\nKenny Donaldson, director of services at SEFF, said the events are designed to bring together all those affected by the atrocity.\n\n\"Over the weekend leading up to the 30th anniversary we have arranged a variety of events for everyone impacted by the bus bombing, he said.\n\n\"This includes the medical physicians, local police and military response, fire service or ambulance personnel, locals living on the Ballygawley Road, the band buses which were following the soldiers\u0027 bus and who came to the scene and heroically offered what assistance they could and others who came upon the scene.\"\n\nThe 52-seater unmarked Ulsterbus coach had been transporting 36 soldiers of the 1st battalion of the Army\u0027s Light Infantry Regiment from Belfast International Airport back to Lisanelly Barracks in Omagh. Eight soldiers from England, aged from 18 to 21, were killed, all but one dying instantly, with another 18 wounded.\n\nThe security forces suspected that an informer may have told the IRA of the bus route and the time it would be at a specific spot. Following the attack, the military started ferrying troops to and from East Tyrone by helicopter to stop future attacks.\n\nThere was evidence, given the fact the explosive used was Semtex, that the Libyan government had supplied the material.

His charisma and sense will be missed at a time when effective global diplomacy is badly needed. RIP\n— Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney) \nAugust 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMr Coveney said: “Kofi Annan was an exceptional international statesman who worked tirelessly for a more peaceful and equal world, both during his long and illustrious career in the United Nations and since his retirement, championing the cause of peace and reconciliation, in particular on his own beloved continent of Africa.”\n\nThe 1998 Good Friday Agreement was signed during his tenure.\n\nMr Coveney said Mr Annan had a dedicated interest in Ireland and the maintenance of peace on the island, commentating as recently as April on the Agreement and its legacy.\n\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement was achieved after difficult compromises by all and it served us well. Amid the wider political and economic uncertainty caused by Brexit, all stakeholders should place the preservation of peace and security as a high priority. \nhttps://t.co/CZKKyCg6zw\n\n— Kofi Annan (@KofiAnnan) \nApril 24, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIn 2004 he met Irish peacekeepers in Dublin to thank them for their service.\n\nHe also visited Ireland in 2015, marking the 60th anniversary of the Republic’s membership of the UN and the positive and sustained commitment Ireland has made in peacekeeping, human rights, international development and disarmament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKofi Annan with Mary Robinson and TD Charlie Flanagan (Maxwells/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe Irish army, as part of the UN forces, has had a decades-long role tackling violence in the Lebanon and dozens have lost their lives.\n\nMr Coveney added: “With the sad passing of Kofi Annan, the international community has lost one of its greatest champions for these causes.\n\n“His dedication to a more equal, interdependent and peaceful world is a shining example to all.\n\n“Kofi Annan has left a significant legacy and it is the responsibility of Ireland and all UN member states to carry his mantle into the future.”\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said Mr Annan was a true multi-lateralist, at a time when we need multi-lateralism, and a tireless advocate for world peace.\n\nHe said: “He remained involved in public life after his retirement and will be long remembered for his commitment to the betterment of the global community.”\n\nIrish President Michael D Higgins said Mr Annan was a constant reminder of the importance of multilateral action by states and of the urgent need to tackle climate change and assist vulnerable communities who are experiencing its effects most acutely.\n\n\n\"A lifelong advocate of international cooperation, Kofi Annan has left an indelible legacy on the global community\"\n\nStatement by President Michael D. Higgins on the death of former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan. \npic.twitter/VmMGqTEfms\n\n— President of Ireland (@PresidentIRL) \nAugust 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“He was a great representative of his country Ghana and of the African continent, and his wisdom, empathy, humour and insights will be greatly missed by all.”\n\nSinn Fein president Mary-Lou McDonald said he was a skilled and dedicated international diplomat.\n\n“Mr Annan was a self-described eternal optimist and a genuine believer in the potential of the international community to rise above our differences. He will be sadly missed.”\n\nFormer Irish president Mary Robinson is part of an international group known as the Elders, of which Mr Annan was the chair.\n\nThey said: “The world has lost an inspiring figure – but one whose achievements will never be forgotten, and whose commitment to peace and justice will endure to inspire future generations.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"stage set for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass.

It has many sources, but one stands out – the Brexit bunch.\n\n“Like most people in this country, whatever we thought of the vote, I accepted it at first – that’s how democracy works.\n\n“But I’ve change my mind completely over the last two years of lies and incompetence.”\n\n\nGreat turn out in Edinburgh for people’s vote on Brexit deal and inspiring speakers!\n#summerofaction\n \npic.twitter/m59L0tGJd4\n\n— Richard Tallaron (@rtallaron) \nAugust 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHe went on: “The Brexit bunch are the most incompetent bunch of politicians in my lifetime and Brexit is in deep trouble, not because of those of us who thought it was a bad idea, but because those who told us it was a good idea are so incompetent, they don’t know what it is.”\n\nHe added: “We can argue against lies and cheating, we can argue for real democracy, we can argue for a truly fair and free and informed vote.\n\n“We can continue to expose the hypocrisy of the Brexit bunch, we can argue for a people’s vote.”\n\n\nThank you - and I’m delighted to be home in Edinburgh today to speak at a city centre rally on the need to discuss the facts about the mess the Brexit Bunch incompetence has created in our country. \nhttps://t.co/kKcmDFvpc4\n\n— Gavin Esler (@gavinesler) \nAugust 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThose attending the rally waved flags and held banners with slogans such as “Whose deal is it? Let the people choose” and “We demand a people’s vote on the Brexit deal”.\n\nOrganisers claimed the event, which was addressed by a number of speakers, was attended by around 1,000 people.\n\nVanessa Glynn, chair of the European Movement in Scotland, told the crowd: “There is no good Brexit. There is rightly wide-spread pessimism about the impact of Brexit on Scottish jobs, businesses, farmers and public services.\n\n“Scots believe that Brexit will make our nation’s economy weaker, Scotland’s NHS worse and our own families significantly poorer … Let’s stop talking about Brexit and start talking about what we want for our future.”\n\n\n“We are already 3,500 midwives short... we cannot lose our EU midwives. Brexit will be a disaster for the \n#NHS\n” \n@MaryRossDavie\n from the RCM Scotland at \n#PeoplesVoteScot\n rally \npic.twitter/KD1Wj98utX\n\n— Women for a People\u0027s Vote (@women4PV) \nAugust 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMary Ross-Davie, director of the Royal College of Midwives in Scotland, said the organisation supports the People’s Vote campaign.\n\n“We’re already 3,500 midwives short across the UK and if we lose our hard-working, fantastic midwife colleagues from the EU, it will be a disaster,” she told supporters.\n\nShe argued that the decision on the final Brexit deal must not rest with a few hundred politicians in Westminster.\n\n“It has to be a decision taken by the tens of millions of us, right across Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, whose lives will be changed forever by it,” she said.\n\n“It is far too big a decision to be left to the politicians alone. We, the people, must decide in a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures air show delights with festival of flight","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Most cameras have sensors that can go up to 3,200 or even 6,400 ISO [International Organisation for Standards]. The footage I captured was shot at 256,000 ISO.”\n\nThe annual Perseid meteor shower is caused by debris falling from the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle and burning up when it comes into contact with the Earth’s atmosphere. \n\nThe meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.\n\nBrandon said: “This year’s shower was better than usual because the peak was next to a new moon allowing for darker skies.”\n\nIn 2018, the Perseid meteor shower is visible from July 17 to August 24.\n\nBrandon gave advice to budding photographers looking to capture the celestial event next year, saying: “I’d start with long exposures of the night sky. There are lots of tutorials on YouTube on how to start.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"putin dances at wedding of austrias foreign minister","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Slovenia, where foreign minister Karin Kneissl married her partner Wolfgang Meilinger, a businessman.\n\nKneissl, an independent, was nominated by the pro-Russia Austrian Freedom Party, whose leaders also attended the wedding.\n\nPhotos showed Putin dancing with the bride, who was dressed in traditional Austrian costume.\n\nAccording to Austrian public broadcaster ORF, Putin also took a small Cossack men’s choir along to entertain about 100 guests at the wedding.\n\nPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies that the Russian president spent about an hour at the wedding.\n\nHe gave the newlyweds a cold press oil machine, a traditional Russian samovar and a landscape painting that “depicts the place where the groom hails from”, said Peskov.\n\nPeskov said Putin proposed “quite a long toast in German in which he said he was thankful and happy that he got a chance to visit the hospitable Austria”.\n\nAustrian politician Joerg Leichtfried of the opposition Social Democratic Party criticised Kneissl’s decision to invite Putin to the wedding.\n\nHe said it called into question Austria’s role as a neutral intermediary in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed rebels are battling government forces.\n\nAustria currently holds the European Union’s rotating presidency.\n\nPutin’s meeting with Merkel late Saturday takes place at the German

Walls became a sea of pointy hats this evening as a coven of hundreds of witches came together to launch the programme for this year’s world famous Halloween celebration in the city.\n\nThe 2018 event will run from 26th October – 3rd November 2018, with over 100 family friendly activities at more than 40 venues, stretching over eight jam-packed days.\n\nThe theme for this year’s Carnival Parade is Return of the Ancients, looking back to the Pagan origins of Hallowe’en which reach far back to the times of Cúchulainn and Fionn MacCool and beyond.\n\nLaunching the event, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, said the gathering of witches perfectly conjured up some of the magical atmosphere which has made Derry Halloween renowned across the world.\n\n“I was delighted to see so many people donning their pointy hats and hopping on their broomsticks to join in the launch this evening. It really captures the true spirit of the event which has always belonged to the people of this city who go to such great lengths to put on a show every year.\n\n“This year we also celebrate 400 years of the City’s magnificent Walls which play such a key part in our celebrations and we can look forward to another spellbinding celebration and an extended festival with plenty for everyone, young and old, to enjoy.\n\n“Be warned, accommodation always gets booked up fast, so anyone travelling should plan their trip now.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027243184\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nAmong the regular highlights which draw thousands to the city each year, is the Awakening of the Walls, which makes a welcome return for 2018.\nAs we celebrate four centuries since the building of the city’s stunning ramparts, watch as they come alive with an illuminated animation trail on and around the City Walls from October 28-30.\n\nThe Guildhall will once again be at the centre of the celebrations with the magical Museum of the Moon bathing the Main Hall in its ethereal light for seven days, and where the Samhain Sessions will showcase some fantastic musical talent under its ghostly glow.\n\nUp to 1000 people will be taking part in the carnival parade which is always the main highlight of the programme and a mass community celebration for all. Following the spectacular carnival celebrations and fireworks finale on October 31st, just when you thought it was all over, on November 1st the Walls will once again become the setting for First Light, which will bring the community together for a special celebration of light, remembrance and renewal.\n\nAdd to this story-telling, ghost tours, the Jack-O-Lantern Festival, the Monster Funfair, Little Horrors, Shape Shifter costume and make up workshops and the haunted Harvest Market, and you have the secret formula for the best Halloween celebration in the world.\n\nLooking ahead to the event, Festivals and Events officer with Council, Liz Cunningham, said: “Tonight’s gathering of witches gives just a hint of what’s to come, and really shows how much the people of the city have made this celebration their own. We are thrilled that so many wicked witches turned up for some fun this evening. This year we’ve extended our programme, making it our biggest celebration to date, and we just look forward now to showing the world how it’s done.”\n\nYou can find out more about all the spooktacular
