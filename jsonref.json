According to the court docket Mel then filed an anti-SLAPP motion which was denied. It\u0027s unclear when the expected ten-day trial will take place, although it had been scheduled for July 23 before an appeal was lodged. Mel has claimed that Gilles was having an affair with her then husband but Gilles launched the defamation case saying that while she did have sex with Belafonte and had an abortion, her main lover was in fact Mel. Gilles claims in legal docs that Mel seduced her when she was aged just 18 and they had a seven-year sexual relationship. Mel has hit back saying Stephen paid the nanny \u0027in excess\u0027 of $300,000 over three years for her work.

In 2016, Barclays scrapped £8 billion of Lobo loans by converting them to fixed-rate loans, at a cost of £182 million to the bank.Barclays board row over possible £61bn merger with rival...Barclays fraud case kicked out: Blow for the Serious Fraud...Share this articleThe councils’ claim form accuses the bank of ‘deceit andor fraudulent misrepresentation’ as its bankers were secretly rigging Libor, which was ‘integral’ to the rate at which Lobo loans had to be paid back.Many local authorities took out the loans as they appeared to promise lower interest rates than those offered by central government. But the loans remain highly contentious as they gave banks the power to impose new rates at certain points. Borrowers could reject the new terms, but would then be forced to repay the entire loan straight away.Barclays and the local authorities declined to comment. But Lianne Craig, a partner at law firm Hausfeld, which is representing the councils, confirmed it had issued a ‘protective claim’ in the High Court.A full claim is due to be filed in the coming months. In 2015, a parliamentary committee launched an investigation into Lobo loans.          Manchester is among the local authorities launching the action against BarclaysRob Carver, a former derivatives trader at Barclays, described the loans as ‘horrible stuff’, telling MPs: ‘I do not think anyone who fully understood it would do it.’Crippling repayment rates of 7 to 9 per cent were attached to some of the loans and are thought to have cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds in interest a year.The 14 local authorities – Bristol, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Kirklees, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, North East Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Oldham, Sheffield, South Gloucestershire, Walsall and West Yorkshire – launched the action. They are preparing to put a number to the total value of the claim if Barclays seeks to defend the action, rather than settle.The councils say the loans – entered into between 2004 and 2010 – should be rescinded with fees returned. They also want compensation for damages.On June 27, 2012, the Financial Services Authority, the precursor to the Financial Conduct Authority, fined Barclays £59.5 million over manipulation of Libor – the London interbank offered rate. Some Lobo loans were directly linked to Libor rates, and many others were influenced by it. In some cases, repayment rates rose if Libor rates fell out of a certain range.Joel Benjamin, of Debt Resistance UK, said: ‘It’s high time banks were made to pay to clean up their own mess.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/16/4E3D2B2900000578-0-image-m-5_1531583925313.jpg","title":"TANA RAMSAY explains exercise helps deal family trauma","story":"    Tana Ramsay, pictured, uses her daily run as an excuse to cry and screamThere is much for Tana Ramsay to be grateful for today. But the wife of sweary television chef Gordon Ramsay, now head of a £43 million restaurant empire, is not immune to shedding a few tears every now and again – indeed, she says, it’s a necessity.Running around Wimbledon Common in South-West London, as Tana does several times a week with the family’s two dogs, she allows herself to cry and occasionally, even, to scream. For the last couple of years have wreaked a heavy emotional toll.There was the devastating loss of their son, the couple’s fifth child, when Tana had a miscarriage at 21 weeks. Then, last year, a bust-up between Gordon and Tana’s father, Chris Hutcheson – who used to run Gordon Ramsay Holdings – ended at the Old Bailey, with the latter jailed for six months for hacking into Gordon’s emails.Earlier it was revealed that Chris had a secret second family, with grown-up children. ‘It’s easy to put a smile on and say, “Everything is absolutely fine!” ’ says Tana.‘But when you’re running, with your music on, you can cry. You can scream. That’s important. You can’t keep it in because it comes back to haunt you if you haven’t processed it. That’s what causes long-term problems.’DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: Keep your blood sugar in check... even if...The many reasons for buying a Georgian house... they\u0027ve got...Share this articleThere is no sign of this emotional turmoil today. Tana, 43, is glowing with good health. She reveals that her father, now 70, is out of jail and competed in his 90th marathon in April this year – alongside his grandchildren.So they’re all back in touch? ‘Oh yes, absolutely,’ Tana says. She won’t say more, but it’s evident that Chris is now very much part of the family again. Whether he and Gordon have patched up their differences is less clear.And Tana, like her father, is arguably in the best shape of her life. She runs marathons, has completed a half-ironman, and is currently training for the London Triathlon to raise money for the couple’s charity, the Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, which has donated £850,000 to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital since 2015.          Tana, pictured centre with husband Gordon, right, and from left son Jack, family friend Alexander Dundas, and daughters Holly and MatildaIt is exercise, more than anything, which has helped the family cope with the tribulations of the past two years.‘What it does is allow you to process things,’ she says.‘Whether it is cycling and chatting together, or running and having a cry on your own, you have to have that release. You also have to have those moments where you allow yourself to feel really sad, when you’re thinking, “Why me?” We’re all going to think like that occasionally. It means we can handle it. It has drawn us together as a family.‘It’s also important to talk with the children and not just think everything is fine. Gordon’s a really big one for talking. Sometimes I just say to him “Seriously?”, and he’s like: “No, we have to talk about it.” Sometimes that’s irritating.’          The Ramsay\u0027s pictured here with Victoria Beckham, centre, are an incredibly sporty familySport runs through almost everything the Ramsay family does. The couple’s four children – Megan, 20, twins Jack and Holly, 18, and Tilly, 16 – compete variously in swimming, netball, rugby, ju-jitsu, hockey and water polo. Their schedule is frenetic: Tana shrugs at the idea that she’s a supermum, but it is impressively well-orchestrated.Jack can be dropped off at school in Dulwich, South-East London, by 6.30am, and Tilly and Holly to their school in Richmond by 7.30am, which leaves Tana time to have a run on Wimbledon Common with the dogs by 7.50am. She’s home by nine, showered and at work at her beauty salon in Battersea by 9.30am.There’s also a home gym – which the whole family uses – and gruelling three-hour cycle rides at the weekends. It’s precisely because the kids are so busy that you won’t see them falling out of nightclubs like other celebrity offspring.‘I don’t worry about the kids going off the rails because they have sport,’ she explains. ‘Yes, they’re teenagers and they’re all on Instagram doing those weird pouts. How could they not be?‘All I can do is make sure they have a healthy relationship between their body and food. Exercise is good not only to keep in shape but mentally it’s fantastic, and a great discipline for kids. Showing them we do it, and instilling that attitude in them, is so important. They’ve been studying for A-level and GCSE exams and I’ve said, “Do a couple of hours of exercise and your brains will work better.”‘I do think it’s helped them to deal with the stress.’Tana admits to following her children on the Find My Friends app, which allows users to see the location of others using GPS. It hasn’t always been reassuring.‘Jack went out after his exams,’ she says. ‘I woke up and it was 5am and he wasn’t home. I’d promised I wouldn’t call because he’s 18, so I went on the app and then saw he was at St Thomas’ Hospital so I freaked and rang him, but tried to sound relaxed. In fact, he was just getting in an Uber.’Tana has run nine marathons and Gordon has competed over a dozen. When Megan turned 18 – the minimum age to take part – she begged to be allowed to do it too. Jack and Holly competed for the first time this year, while Tilly, who has her own CBBC show, Matilda And The Ramsay Bunch, is ‘chomping at the bit’ to have her chance.GORDON, 51, naturally, has the best time (3.30) – ‘have you seen his thighs?’ – followed by Tana, a respectable 25 minutes behind. All of them except Tilly, who will be on a water polo tour, are taking part in the London Triathlon on August 4 to 5. Surely there must be competition? Tana laughs. ‘Between Jack and Gordon it can get pretty intense,’ she admits. ‘But Jack hasn’t beaten me at the marathon yet. They all make me incredibly proud, and I get very emotional.‘There’s so much pressure on them already with social media, so the more normal we keep it the easier it is as a family to just be us, and for them to have the confidence to be themselves.’Tana is clearly comfortable in her own skin, and felt no pressure to stay in shape as Gordon’s celebrity rose. They married in 1996 when he was head chef at Aubergine in Chelsea – now he has 35 restaurants across the globe and seven Michelin stars, along with TV projects in the UK and US.The couple count the Beckhams among their closest friends, so does Tana train with Victoria? ‘No, although when we’re in America we do go to Soul Cycle classes together. I’d love to get Victoria in an ironman competition.’ Tana looks mischievous. Would she do it? ‘No, I doubt it. She’d look at me like I was some kind of maniac, I imagine.’Tana obviously sees things differently – for Gordon and her, exercise is a release. The couple take long cycle rides together on Sundays, completing up to 60 miles a time over the Surrey hills as part of their triathlon training.‘We’ve always been good at spending time away from the kids, just the two of us. Finding something which helps you remember what you like in that person, after so many years of marriage, is great. Gordon might have been away all week in the US, but we’ll go out early in the morning and spend several hours on our bikes and catch up.‘For me, a mum in my 40s, it’s also about doing something just to feel good about myself. I’ve given the kids all of my attention for all of these years, so it’s time for me. I really enjoy it – it’s so social.’Food, perhaps unsurprisingly, is important in the Ramsay household but Tana insists they have ‘a good balance’. ‘I never obsessed over having perfect food for the kids at all times,’ she says. ‘I never watched over them at parties, never said, “Don’t eat this.” I didn’t want to be a helicopter mum, forever hovering over them.‘We’ll have chocolate in the fridge, but our meals are usually healthy. That’s how it should be.’They try to eat together as a family as much as possible but their conflicting schedules mean it happens ‘maybe once or twice a week’.Breakfast is ‘a slice of toast while running down the stairs’, she says. When asked if the children are talented cooks, she pauses before sniggering: ‘They do cook.’Refreshingly, too, there’s no special ‘training diet’ as she prepares for the triathlon. Tana has always run and once finished a 5km in a very good time of 19 minutes. The London Triathlon involves a 750m swim (‘longer than it sounds’, she jokes, grimly), then a 20km cycle ride followed by a 5km run.It’s for a great cause. The Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, set up in 2014, has 235 competitors signed up to Team Ramsay, and money raised for Great Ormond Street has, in previous years, funded research projects and intensive-care equipment.Does she see herself doing it at 80? ‘My father has just had a hip replacement and has been on this health regime. He’s lost a stone in three weeks and ran his 90th marathon in April with three of his grandchildren and one of his sons. I’d like to aspire to that.‘At 80, I want to have energy, I want to be saying to Gordon, “Let’s go on holiday with our bikes and panniers, somewhere like Hawaii.”‘Enjoying our time after working so hard, just ambling around. That’s how I see us.’    Start in a low lunge, with one knee down and the other leg forwards. Then, engaging your core muscles, switch legs.

Around me an army of eager, Lycra-clad men and women stand in neat rows, shoulder width apart, eyes widened. Ear-bleedingly loud dance music pumps through the speakers as Heidi and Chris Powell – the stars of US hit reality show Extreme Weight Loss – take the stage to lead an exercise class that will help us reach our ‘pain threshold’ and ‘burn optimum body fat’.Someone in the crowd screams. Another cries. It’s not yet 7.30am. Welcome to the first day of the world’s biggest fitness convention: Idea World, in San Diego, southern California.Dubbed the ‘superbowl of the fitness industry’, the annual event brings together more than 200 fitness industry professionals, trainers and celebrity weight-loss gurus, alongside 14,000 exercise fanatics from all around the globe.They flock to the four-day festival to find the latest innovations and trends in workouts, equipment and technology on offer.

Over the course of 48 hours, Eve tried out 20 different work outs at the Idea World fitness convention in San Diego, CaliforniaFinding my balance on the rubber sphere is tough enough let alone extending opposite arm and legs simultaneously. Remarkably, by focusing on a spot on the wall in front of me, I’m able to complete the rest of the routine with minimal wobbling.After Tae Bo, a mixture of martial arts and aerobics, comes Booty Barre – a class especially designed to build a beautiful bottom.The workout – whose fans include Madonna – draws on the principles of Pilates and ballet.As a regular Pilates goer, I was fairly confident I’d get through the hour with ease, but after five minutes of thrusting with a medicine ball between my legs – on tiptoes – I realise this isn’t the case.By the end of the class, my thighs are like jelly and I’m starving hungry. It’s 10am.BOOT CAMP, BOXING... AND BATTLE ROPESI decide to get the worst out the way before lunchtime: army boot camp.Developed by a former US sergeant, this is a 90-minute sweatathon involving jumping squats, lunges and sprints interspersed with military-style marches. Angry orders from Sergeant Ken Weichart (aka Sgt Ken) to ‘Embrace The Pain!’ keep me moving despite the agony but after 50 rapid squats and the sergeant’s demands to ‘get lower’, I succumb to the pain and embarrassingly stumble mid-rep. ‘No quitters here!’ Ken loudly reminds me.I manage a 30-minute lunch break before leaping straight into the on-site boxing ring for a couple of rounds with a bullish, bald-headed former champ.          This odd-looking device is supposed to provide a work out for bums and tumsTo my surprise, I can throw a mean punch and even manage a spin, kick and smack move.Then I move across to Battle Ropes. After 15 minutes of tutorial, we experiment with all 30 ways a 55 lb, 50ft rope can be moved about for a vigorous full-body workout.It’s not all about waving it with the hands – try jumping between two ropes for a quick warm-up, or lifting the ropes in between press-ups to work the core and arms. At the end of the class, I unashamedly collapse on the floor into a pool of my own sweat and admit defeat. Tomorrow is another day…TORTURE... FOR KILLER ABSOn day two, I explore the 500,000 square foot exhibition hall showcasing almost 400 cutting-edge fitness gadgets and machinery.I start with a demonstration of the latest vibrating Power Plate to hit US gyms. The machine stimulates muscles with vibration, increasing muscle tone when exercising. I expect to watch my love handles wiggle off my body without moving but unfortunately, some work is required. I try step-ups and single leg balances, before moving on to planks, bridges and seated crunches – all aboard the vibrating platform. Each exercise feels ten times more intense than I’d ever experienced before, with ripples of pain shooting through my entire body.Converts claim that those ten minutes of excruciating torture are the fastest route to killer abs.Other highlights of the exhibition include a 6ft stair-climbing machine which, on maximum resistance, feels five times harder than normal stairs a virtual-reality treadmill that sends me running through the French countryside and a cycling machine called Real Ryder which tilts 22 degrees and emits stimulating vibrations. I disembark the bike, feeling two stone lighter, and seek out an upper-body exercise to give my legs some well-earned rest.

The pair were engaged and set to exchange contracts on a £1.6 million family home in West Sussex when he left for a coffee and never came back          Winter, pictured here on the couple\u0027s first-class flight to Dubai in 2013, claimed his family’s assets had been frozen and his own money was tied up because of his orce proceedingsLast week, a High Court judge awarded her a sum just over that amount in a civil fraud case she brought against Winter. However, Sacher, now 48, says the emotional price has been far greater.Speaking about her ordeal for the first time, she reveals that Winter, the 44-year-old son of wealthy businessman and Tory party donor John Winter, spun a web of lies from the beginning, telling Sacher he owned property, a gold bullion account, a £100,000 wine collection and a share of a boat in Monaco, and received £2 million a year in idends. Most cruelly, he told her he had prostate cancer.‘I thought I’d found my soulmate,’ she says.‘We laughed every day and I loved him deeply. Little did I know I was sleeping next to a monster.’Sitting in the cramped one-bedroom flat she now rents in West London, Sacher admits she used to dismiss women like her. ‘I’ve read this story before and thought, “Silly woman. It would never happen to me.” But Richard Winter is a silver-tongued conman. Even now I have to pinch myself. I look back now and think, “Was I that gullible?” Yes, but in my defence I believe he groomed me. It didn’t cross my mind that he was constantly scheming against me. I’m not a stupid girl, but I feel absolutely stupid and utterly betrayed.’Sacher says she was vulnerable when she met Winter in 2011. Her five-year marriage had ended in orce and her confidence was low. Winter told her he was separated from the mother of his two children. In retrospect, Sacher now realises the warning signs were there from the beginning.          Sacher said she would loan Winter money from a £550,000 nest egg she received from her own orce (pictured together on his 40th birthday)          Sacher says she was vulnerable when she met Winter in 2011. She added: ‘He mirrored everything I liked. Most men hate beach holidays, but Richard loved lying in the sun reading a book\u0027 (pictured together at a wedding in Italy in 2014)‘We were in each other’s pockets,’ she says. ‘He mirrored everything I liked. Most men hate beach holidays, but Richard loved lying in the sun reading a book. We had the same taste in food and music. He’d even like to watch romcoms. At the time I thought, “Wow! This is fabulous.” On reflection, he was making himself perfect. He lulled me into a false sense of security.’Winter indicated he came from a wealthy background and was the beneficiary of two trust funds. He also said he had sold a business for £5 million.‘He threw his money around like confetti,’ Sacher says. In their first year they went on a series of luxury holidays and Sacher recalls a lunch at The Savoy Hotel in London during which Winter ordered a £1,000 bottle of red wine, saying: ‘This is how it is for me. Relax, enjoy it.’‘It was like a whirlwind, my feet didn’t touch the ground,’ she says. ‘I now see it was part of his plotting so when he asked to borrow money I didn’t see any risk.’Fraudster who once posed as the Duke of Marlborough and...How this photo (and his wife\u0027s £100-an-hour yoga habit)...Share this articleKeen to impress, Richard took her on regular shopping trips and showered her with expensive gifts from Harrods – where staff even knew him by name. Presents included two Rolex watches costing tens of thousands of pounds. One had the inscription: ‘Thanks for making me smile again.’The mask began to slip in May 2012 when Winter claimed his family’s assets had been frozen and his own money was tied up because of his orce proceedings.Sacher had a nest egg of £550,000 from her own orce. She says: ‘We agreed I would loan Richard the money until his was all unfrozen. He’d been so good to me and I thought it was right to give and take. I gave him access to my accounts because effectively it was his money.’ They continued to live a life that most people can only dream about, but later on that year Sacher grew concerned.Perhaps sensing he was on borrowed time, Winter unleashed his most unforgivable tactic yet: telling Sacher he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.Deeply concerned, Sacher paid for therapy sessions for him, even sitting in on one: ‘Richard would sob, but they were just crocodile tears. Then it all stopped. He said he was feeling better, that it was the slowest-growing cancer and would take a long time to have an impact. I accepted that.’Soon afterwards, he proposed. He took her to Cartier to try on three engagement rings he had picked out especially. ‘Again, they knew his name in the shop and had flown one of the rings in from France,’ she says.          After Sacher became concerned about their spending, Winter unleashed his most unforgivable tactic yet: telling Sacher he had been diagnosed with prostate cancerShe chose an oval diamond ring costing more than £100,000. But it never materialised – and neither did the wedding. Meanwhile, the spending continued, Sacher using some of her nest egg herself. In January 2013, Winter booked first-class tickets to Dubai.‘I know it sounds stupid and gullible, but I loved and trusted him. Also, after his diagnosis, I couldn’t put pressure on him.’ He would later admit to Sacher that he had lied about his cancer diagnosis.Even when Sacher’s money ran out later that year, she believed everything would turn out for the best. She sold her Range Rover for £40,000 and pawned jewellery to raise funds so that they could rent a cottage in West Wittering, West Sussex.When Winter’s orce came through a year later, she asked about repayment.‘Richard said his father wouldn’t release the assets. I started thinking, “Here’s a new excuse.” ’He reassured her by saying his main concern was for her to feel her money was secure and had his lawyers draw up a loan agreement. And they were as happy as ever. Winter started looking at family homes to buy when his funds became available.He settled on a four-bedroom house on the market for £1.6 million and a bungalow nearby for Sacher’s parents. ‘He took builders around and had grand plans for renovations,’ Sacher says. In February 2015, on the day they were due to exchange, they both woke up excited about their future. But for Sacher the feeling would be fleeting.She recalls: ‘Richard left me hoovering and nipped into town for a coffee. He never came back.’It was about two weeks before she received a call from him. ‘He had a story and said he’d had to hand in his phone.’ He promised he would get Sacher’s money back and she was so in thrall to him that their relationship continued.She explains: ‘I was hanging on to any word or hope that he was genuine. He had my financial future in his power.’Winter visited regularly over the next few months, even spending Father’s Day with Sacher’s parents. He promised them he would repay Sacher, sending them a bouquet of roses with a note to say the same.On three occasions he said he would transfer the money, but it never happened. Forced to put the house sale on hold, Sacher then received a letter to say their rent was £10,000 in arrears.She says: ‘I had 24 hours to move out. I was put on the drive with my things in bin bags. I had no money, was in tens of thousands of pounds of debt, and had a dog to care for. I had to sleep on my parents’ sofa.’          Sacher paid for therapy sessions for him, even sitting in on one: ‘Richard would sob, but they were just crocodile tears. Then it all stopped. He said he was feeling better, that it was the slowest-growing cancer and would take a long time to have an impact. I accepted that’          Last week, a High Court judge awarded her a sum just over that amount in a civil fraud case she brought against WinterThe last time Sacher saw Winter was just before Christmas 2015.The following month, a friend called her to say that Winter had written on Facebook that he had been in a relationship with another woman since the previous September.Sacher says: ‘The shock was so huge. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat. I could not accept that someone I loved, cared for and trusted could do that to me, or that I was a victim of fraud. I believe it was a sick game to him.’ Desperate, she sued him in the civil courts for fraud.In his judgment, His Honour Judge Rawlings said Winter’s conduct appeared to have been ‘driven principally by his addiction to spending money… rather than any intention to inflict distress’ upon Sacher. She, however, maintains that Winter knew exactly what he was doing. ‘Richard knows the game he played,’ she says. ‘He has never said sorry.’Winter, who is now married and works as a dog-walker, of course sees things rather differently – but declined to comment.Although she won the case, the judge also suggested Sacher had been ‘the author of her own misfortune’ – a statement that clearly stings.She says: ‘When you’re in what you believe to be a loving relationship and the other person turns out to be a liar and a fraudster, how can you be even partly responsible for their behaviour?’After a two-and-a-half-year fight that cost £100,000 in legal fees, Sacher is now concentrating on getting her life back on track, but says the emotional and financial scars will never heal.‘His life has moved on unscathed, but I will always suffer the effects. He hasn’t just taken my money, he’s left me financially and emotionally in the gutter.‘Now he could do the right thing and pay me back my money. I can’t forgive and I will never forget.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/20/4E3D21AB00000578-0-image-m-105_1531595688304.jpg","title":"How author HELEN JUKES got buzz life keeping bees","story":"    Author Helen Jukes, pictured, dramatically improved the quality of her life when she began keeping bees Honey is everywhere. There’s no stopping it. My friends and I have harvested two honeycombs from the beehive I’ve been keeping and now we’re in the kitchen of my two-up, two-down in Oxford, sieving it over a pan, straining the comb and mashing it with our spoons. The honey gloops and the smell is like sweetness and wax and splintered wood.A honey bee will make about a twelfth of a teaspoon of honey in her whole lifetime. Yet if you were to cut a piece of string equivalent to the combined flight distance made by foragers for just one jar of honey, it would reach almost one-and-a- half times around the world. I wonder how many lifetimes is oozing from the combs.I abandon my spoon and begin using my hands. They glisten and stick to things, and everything sticks to them. We’re licking our fingers and the taste makes me think of something intricately spun, clear and sharp and full of the sun.‘How did it go?’ Pat asks, when I call up later to tell him about the harvest.I did 20 workouts in 48 hours so you don\u0027t have to... just...I can cry and scream when I\u0027m running: TANA RAMSAY explains...Share this articleI try to describe what the inside of the hive looked like and how we harvested the comb, what it felt like to carry it away in my hands.‘I want to see you,’ he says.‘I want to see you too.’The day the idea arrives, just ten months earlier, I am wanting badly to escape. But I quickly bury the thought. Because I can’t just get out. I’ve already moved houses, changed cities, to take this job at a charity in Oxford – I can’t just up and leave.          A single honey bee will make around one twelfth of a spoon of honey in its lifetimeAs I walk in to work each morning I feel the muscles at the back of my neck clench, and they stay like that until I leave. The plant I brought in to brighten my desk has died and I’m not sure how to dispose of it.The skin around my eyes is tight. Maybe the screen is too bright or my focus is too narrow, or maybe muscles are tired of bracing themselves against everything that has been pressing in. I rub my eyes, refocus. This is when the idea comes back again.‘I might get a beehive,’ I say out loud, to no one in particular. Joanna who sits at the desk opposite bellows a laugh and points at my sorry pot plant. ‘Madness,’ she says bluntly, and returns to her screen. No one else says anything. I don’t say anything. And that, it seems, is the end of it.Home from work and too wound up to stay inside, I open the back door, step out into the garden. A nerve at the back of my eye buzzes as if the whirr of the computer screen has got inside my head.But for one moment, maybe two, sheltered by the holly in my back garden that pricks my thighs, I forget where I am. Forget the house that doesn’t feel like home yet, and the hectic work schedule.This is when the idea arrives. Here is where the bees would be.          Helen, pictured, learned about bee keeping while living in London before moving to OxfordI learned about beekeeping a few years ago when I lived in London, where I met Luke, who has hives all over the city. Urban beekeeping is a big thing now – part of a resurgence over the past decade in beekeeping as a hobby.The first time we met, Luke was wearing a cream three-piece suit, a pink shirt and a summer boater, and he was swinging a blue IKEA bag. We were outside Coram’s Fields, a children’s park in Central London, where he kept two hives in a thin strip of undergrowth behind the cafe.‘So you’ve come to see the bees?’ he said, and I nodded.‘Some people believe that bees can smell your fear,’ he said, as he unlocked a gate in the iron railings and we followed a gravel path around. So as we pulled on our protective suits, I concentrated on not being afraid, but when he lifted a hive lid and they began seething out I was terrified. Beneath the lid the space was packed with wooden frames hanging perpendicular to the roofline, each one filled to its edges with comb, covered and crawling with bees.I hadn’t even realised until then that honey bees are different from bumblebees that there are more than 20,000 species of bee in the world, and only a small fraction of them actually make honey.Soon I was beekeeping whenever I could. Luke would send a text message with an address and a time of meeting and I’d jump on my bike and race through the streets to go and join him. It would be another story to have a colony of bees by the back fence of the house I was renting in Oxford with my friend Becky. And in truth, I’m not so well versed in keeping things. I haven’t lived anywhere longer than 18 months in my adult life. I don’t find it difficult to make new friends and bar a few misjudged kerfuffles, I haven’t had a boyfriend for years.On Christmas Day, my brother reaches under the tree for a small hand-made envelope and holds it out towards me.          One Christmas, Helen\u0027s brother and their friends bought her a colony of bees as a presentInside the envelope is a drawing of a honey bee. On the back are the names of friends who have all put money in to buy me a colony. Next to their names is the address of a farm near Banbury.This is where the bees are waiting, the note says. You can collect them in the spring. I’m touched, and thrilled, and panicked.And so, one Sunday in March, Luke and I drive to the farm to collect the colony.Back in Oxford we put on our beekeeping suits, then take the box out and open it, slipping the wooden frames out and placing them inside the boat-shaped, tangerine-coloured hive I’ve bought.In May, I’m visited by my friend Dan from Leeds. We sit on the doorstep with a bottle of wine and I tell him about all the research I’m doing into bees. Dan reaches over and ruffles my hair.‘Been staying in a lot recently, have you?’ he laughs. ‘You’re turning bee-obsessed. Why don’t you give yourself a break? Have some fun, for Christ’s sake!’I’m caught off guard. Perhaps I have been too caught up. But the hive has become a counterweight to a work environment I’ve been finding stressful. I’ve begun to relax out here to drop some of the rigid outer casings that were holding me stiffly and rather unhappily in place.The following month, I am itching to see Luke and for him to see the hive. ‘Look at that,’ he says, lifting a bar out. ‘Now that’s a good start.’The comb attached to it is thick and full at least as long as my forearm. The walls of a single hexagonal cell are only eight-hundredths of a millimetre thick. I peer in, trying to make out inidual cells under those thousands of crowding feet. Inside we spot eggs and larvae, surrounded by pollen and nectar and a soft rim of honey stores.‘Well,’ he says, when we’re nearly through, ‘there must be nearly 100,000 bees in here. It’s the biggest colony I’ve seen all year.’When a hive is full, the colony will split in two. There’s a lesson in here somewhere. As I feel new spaces forming, new possibilities opening beyond the hive, I too have been preparing to break out.Another friend, Dulcie, says: ‘You should meet my friend Pat. He’s a beekeeper too. Maybe we can all meet up when you’re in London next week. You two have just the same taste in furniture.’I laugh and say that I didn’t know I had any taste in furniture but yes, OK, I will meet this beekeeper with the chairs that are just like mine.          In September, Helen\u0027s hive had been transformed - filled with honeycombWhen the weekend comes, I go straight to the station after work and catch the train to London, then sit in my seat and watch as the view outside the window begins to crawl, and then to flow past.Then it is Sunday, and there I am waiting for Dulcie’s friend, hoping we’ll find something to talk about or that, if we don’t, he’ll leave quickly.‘Dulcie told me you’re a beekeeper,’ I say, stepping back into the doorway to let him through.‘I’m not a beekeeper,’ he says as he takes off his shoes.‘I don’t know where she got that idea.’ And then there is a pause. ‘My uncle’s a beekeeper,’ he offers. ‘Oh dear.’I’ve seen Pat again. He’s a musician he makes music. I’ve heard it, and it’s really good.We sit on a log in a park in South London eating toasted sandwiches sticky with melted cheese, and talk about being kids and growing up.As I walk away after meeting him each time I have a feeling of being differently weighted. I am quieter as I move around, and lighter, like something emptied. The soles of my feet notice the ground under them. Not just firmness or softness but also movement, like the rumble of this lorry passing.The next time I see Pat I am due to visit him at his flat.We meet at Forest Hill station and he grins when he sees me, and springs a little on his feet. We walk back to his flat.Later I tell him I’d like to kiss him. There is a pause of a few moments that feels like a very long time indeed.And the time to leave and catch my bus arrives, and I don’t leave. .‘This doesn’t happen to me very often,’ he says afterwards.‘This doesn’t happen to me very often either.’On the day of the harvest, in September, it is clear right away that the inside of the hive has been transformed. Where eggs and larvae lay only a month ago, we now find row upon row of honeycomb.We fill one large Kilner jar and six small ones – it takes us three hours.Over this past season, it seems to me that the hive – that teeming space by the far fence – became a refuge.Down by the hive, away from the city’s tough exteriors, I found a place where I could take my armour plating off could become more exposed, more capable of touching and being touched. Perhaps I became better at caring, too.Pat and I have begun thinking that we might want to make some changes, move a bit closer to each other, some time soon.I can’t shake the feeling I have when I look at him sometimes that through this experience of beekeeping, of learning about and listening to the colony, I might have called something up – might have begun to articulate and name a connection I needed.© Helen Jukes, 2018 A Honeybee Heart Has Five Openings, by Helen Jukes, is published by Scribner UK on July 26, priced £14.99.

We are privileged to be able to share them and their important conservation message with our visitors, who will absolutely adore them.’Known for doing little more than chewing gum leaves and napping for up to 22 hours a day, koalas are ided into two distinct groups the smaller northern variety, and the southern koala, which has thicker fur and can weigh twice as much.

So it’s not something that they do readily, which makes us very proud and honoured that they have chosen to do this with us.’          Six species of Eucalyptus are being grown on the estate to feed the koalasThe six koalas – five females and a male – and two hairy-nosed wombats, thought to be their closest relative, will be flown by private cargo plane to Britain. The animals’ sensitive nature means they will be in the cabin and not the hold.

VIP guests may even be able to feed them.          Adorable: Emma Weymouth with one of the koalas heading for LongleatLongleat has planted a 4,000-tree eucalyptus plantation, although the koalas’ main food source will initially be supplied by a farm in Devon. The animals are such prodigious eaters of eucalyptus leaves that it has led some to argue that they are ‘eating themselves’ out of their natural environment.‘They are so fragile that we will have to monitor their eating habits very closely,’ says Ceawlin.‘It takes two weeks to digest the leaves they favour, so if a koala stops eating for a day it’s only two weeks later that any problem will manifest. They are very emotionally sensitive so can get stressed easily.’          Lucy Wormaid (left) and Kim Reynolds check on progress of the building of the Koala Creek facility at Longleat, a new, purpose-built habitat for koalas and wombats from AustraliaAlthough they have few natural predators, koalas are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus. But by far their biggest threat is urbanisation. Climate change and land clearing are pushing populations in New South Wales and Queensland towards the edge of extinction.Professor Chris Daniels, director of Cleland, says a lot is riding on the Longleat project. ‘It’s not only a way of helping to ensure that we have a population outside Australia, but we will learn more about their breeding through the studies that will be done there.’Emma adds: ‘They are such beautiful and appealing creatures that we are very excited that they will become part of the Longleat family of animals. And our hope is that this will help to raise awareness of the need to preserve their natural habitat.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/12/4E3158CF00000578-0-image-m-60_1531479952991.jpg","title":"Touching letter Agatha Christie PG Wodehouse reveals firm friendship later years","story":"    Woman of letters: Dame Agatha and PG Wodehouse began corresponding late in lifeThe letters from Dame Agatha are part of an archive of Wodehouse papers which have now been loaned to the British Library by his estate.In one letter, the crime writer reveals her antipathy towards her public and their demands.Writing on May 24, 1971, Dame Agatha says she welcomed how a postal strike had left her cut off from the outside world.The ‘sweet’ consequence of the dispute was the complete absence of ‘fan mail… begging letters’ and ‘requests that you should send articles of personal wear (??

Disgusting idea!) to charity sales’.Dame Agatha was 79 when she began corresponding with 88-year-old Wodehouse in 1969.Fury over plans to build 215 homes on the farm that inspired...Broke, forgotten and buried in an unmarked grave: Tragic end...Share this articlePerhaps not surprisingly given their respective ages, the veteran authors were preoccupied with health matters.In a letter dated May 13, 1970, Dame Agatha lampoons the pretensions of clueless doctors who dole out antibiotics ‘until one of them does the trick or alternatively lays you in your coffin!’ She also celebrates the loss of four stone ‘as a good result’ of the heart attack she suffered in 1969.          PG Wodehouse, pictured above in 1968She writes: ‘Only nuisance has been that slimmer hips has resulted in a tendency to lose my skirt when I cross a street. Have to be held together by safety pins.’The letters between the two highlight a shared admiration for each other’s work – as well as a mutual distrust of the publishing business which made their names. Dame Agatha tells Wodehouse she is frequently infuriated by proof-readers who insist on ‘correcting’ the grammar of her characters’ dialogue.She says: ‘It really does enrage me, because few people I have ever met do talk grammatically and this includes myself.’Dame Agatha also quickly tired of the numerous national celebrations in 1970 to mark her 80th birthday, writing: ‘Why should people congratulate one for being 80 years old – no damned merit in it.’Wodehouse died on February 14, 1975. Dame Agatha died aged 85 on January 12, 1976.  \u0027Let\u0027s make Jeeves sexy\u0027PG Wodehouse considered sexing-up his best-loved creation Jeeves for the theatre.In a letter to producer Guy Bolton from February 5, 1951, Wodehouse said of a possible comedy to feature the valet and his gentleman master Bertie Wooster: ‘We ought to write a completely new play starring Jeeves – something a bit risky with a lot of sex in it.‘My type of story is apt to be a bit thin on stage… So why don’t we try to get something sexy for a Jeeves play?’The idea of sexing-up Jeeves – perhaps in an attempt to attract an American audience – will surprise readers who know the character only for impeccable manners and unfailing acumen.Eventually, Wodehouse and Bolton wrote the comedy Come On, Jeeves – first performed in 1954."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/21/4E3FD3E600000578-5954585-EVAN_DAVIS_Declared_up_to_259_999_Presenting_110_editions_of_New-m-4_1531600788904.jpg","title":"BBC using smoke mirrors ploy disguise talents real earnings","story":"    FIONA BRUCE: Declared up to £189,999.

They include:Claudia Winkleman, who was paid up to £499,999 by the BBC in 2016-17 but who, according to the annual report, received up to £379,999 in the last financial year. The BBC Radio 2 presenter was unavailable for comment but it is understood her earnings for co-presenting Strictly Come Dancing – estimated at up to £12,000 an episode by a showbusiness insider – are paid through BBC Studios.Newsnight and BBC Radio 4 presenter Evan Davis, whose publicly declared pay fell £40,000 from the sum of up to £299,999 that he received last year, but who this weekend confirmed that BBC Studios pays his fees for presenting Dragons\u0027 Den.Newsreader Fiona Bruce, whose pay appears to have plummeted from a band between £350,000 and £399,999 last year to between £180,000 and £189,999 this year. Her agent declined to say if BBC Studios paid the 54-year-old for her work on Antiques Roadshow or Fake Or Fortune?          CLAUDIA WINKLEMAN: Declared up to £379,999. Paid for weekly Radio 2 show and a ‘range of programmes and series’. Hidden up to £120,000 including earnings from Strictly, whose stars are now thought to be paid through BBC StudiosOther well-known figures have simply vanished, despite still regularly appearing in hit BBC programmes. They include:EastEnders star Danny Dyer, who was paid up to £249,000 by the Corporation last year, but who did not feature on the latest BBC list of 64 stars who received £150,000 or more in the year to April 2018. Dyer and several other EastEnders stars receive their now undisclosed salaries through BBC Studios.Strictly judge Darcey Bussell, who received up to £199,999 last year. The retired ballerina is understood to be paid by BBC Studios for her work on the show that last year drew audiences of up to 12 million.Matt Baker, whose work on The One Show and Countryfile contributed to earnings of up to £499,999 in 2016-17 but did not feature on the BBC\u0027s list of top earners last year. His agent did not comment but it is thought his payments for The One Show and Countryfile are funnelled through BBC Studios.The BBC\u0027s list of top earners – whose salaries are published in income brackets of £10,000 – has dropped from 96 to 64 in the Corporation\u0027s latest accounts.It means BBC stars pocketed almost £19.3 million in 2017-18, compared to £31.1 million in 2016-17. Politicians this weekend voiced fury over the lack of transparency.Writing in The Mail on Sunday, Damian Collins, Chair of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, says: \u0027It is time for the BBC to... provide real transparency and publish the pay of all stars earning more than £150,000, no matter who is writing the cheque. This is something that the Corporation owes to those who pay the licence fee.\u0027Ironically, Lord Hall, the BBC\u0027s Director-General, described his Damascene conversion on the issue of pay transparency to Mr Collins and his fellow committee members in January. Lord Hall, who had led the BBC\u0027s fight to keep earnings a secret, said: \u0027I now understand the transparency in this area is the root to trust in the systems of the BBC.\u0027           DANNY DYER: Declared nothing. Actor is not on this year’s list of those on more than £150,000. Hidden up to £249,999 His EastEnders pay – thought to be up to £249,999 last year – is now paid via BBC Studios          DAME DARCEY BUSSELL: Declared nothing Strictly judge is not among list of 64 top earners this year. Hidden up to £199,999 Like others on Strictly, it is thought that the retired ballerina is paid by BBC StudiosUrging Lord Hall to make good on his words, Tory MP Philip Davies said: \u0027The new list is a con. Naturally people wonder what the BBC has got to hide. If they have got nothing to hide then they should publish everything.\u0027 Fellow Tory MP Andrew Bridgen added: \u0027The BBC is guilty of using smoke and mirrors.\u0027 Lord Hall cannot complain that the controversy is a surprise. In March, almost 250 BBC staff including Mariella Frostrup, BBC Breakfast\u0027s Naga Munchetty and Victoria Derbyshire signed an open letter that said: \u0027Full publication of inidual salaries and benefits (and other payments through BBC Studios and all commercial arms) would have a lasting positive impact on the culture of the BBC and beyond.\u0027With suspicion over the transparency of BBC pay, some fear that the system may allow the Corporation to create the illusion of cutting costs by giving stars more for work paid through BBC Studios and less for work that contributes to the figures published in annual reports. A BBC spokesman denied this was the case. The latest pay disclosures suggest that some stars are being paid for unspecified work, described in the annual report as a \u0027BBC TV fee for a range of programmes and series\u0027.          MATT BAKER: Declared nothing despite continued high-profile on The One Show and Countryfile, he was not on the list. Hidden up to £499,999 ‘Multi-genre’ work, which earned up to £499,999 last year, is now paid by BBC StudiosOne recipient was Mary Berry, paid up to £199,999 in 2017-18. That does not include payments for work on BBC shows including Britain\u0027s Best Home Cook, Mary Berry\u0027s Country House Secrets and Mary Berry Everyday. The 83-year-old was unavailable for comment but an insider said she may have earned up to £20,000 per episode.Another example is Graham Norton, whose pay of up to £609,999 last year – down by up to £290,000 on the previous year according to the annual report – comprised his weekly show on BBC Radio 2 and a \u0027BBC TV fee for a range of programmes and series\u0027. The figure does not include earnings from the 55-year-old\u0027s weekly chat show, The Eurovision Song Contest or the talent show Let It Shine. His chat show earnings are paid through SO Television Ltd, an independent firm commissioned by the BBC to produce the shows.According to SO\u0027s latest accounts, he earned £2.6 million in \u0027presenter fees, productions fees and royalties\u0027 in 2016. A spokesman for Mr Norton said: \u0027I\u0027m afraid we don\u0027t comment on our clients fees.\u0027A BBC spokesman dismissed claims that the list was misleading. \u0027The BBC leads the way on transparency and we went further than the Royal Charter requires by giving details of the work people did and giving details of pay in the current year as well,\u0027 he said.\u0027The Government has agreed that BBC Studios is a commercial operation not underpinned by the licence fee so, just like the independent production companies it competes for business with, it isn\u0027t required to disclose salaries.\u0027 He insisted the sole reason for setting up BBC Studios was about \u0027securing the future of BBC production\u0027.    WHAT A WASTE: Fatberg AustopsyHowever, it made just 40 hours of non-BBC programmes in its first year. Its programmes include Fatberg Autopsy, for Channel 4, which saw experts analysing the content of a giant lump of congealed fat, wet wipes and human waste. And viewers of W Channel can look forward to Sex, Knives \u0026amp Liposuction, in which the presenter considers whether to have plastic surgery.BBC Studios, which makes 55 per cent of all BBC programmes and was given free rein to pitch to rival broadcasters last April, insisted the company had made a ‘good start’.                                                      DAMIAN COLLINS MP, CHAIRMAN OF MEDIA SELECT COMMITTEE: License fee payers have a right to the full picture The use of BBC Studios to mask the pay of the Corporation’s highest earners runs against the spirit of the Royal Charter agreement and the transparency that it was meant to achieve.Last year, for the first time, the BBC published the salaries of talent earning more than £150,000 after recommendations from the then Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.          U-TURN: Lord Hall initially fought to keep stars\u0027 earnings a secretThe BBC had argued it would lead to an exodus of talent – a so-called ‘poachers’ charter’ – as other broadcasters moved in to steal the Corporation’s best and brightest stars.In reality, a year on, that myth has been dispelled. Far from leading to talent leaving the BBC, the salary disclosures have ignited a debate about equal pay for men and women, ersity on screen and value for money.But this year, something was missing. Nearly £12 million, in fact.Another key part of the Royal Charter agreement was the ability of the Corporation to establish BBC Studios, enabling the broadcaster to use its expertise to create productions for other channels.                             In the whole period of the Charter negotiation, I was worried... about too much transparency from the point of view of competition and people being poached. I now understand that the transparency in this area if the root to trust in the systems of the BBC                        Director-General Lord Hall, January 31 BBC Studios is counted as an independent production company and, in what has become a huge loophole, the stars it pays do not have to appear on the BBC’s list of top earners.This is not right.To be sure, the BBC is moving in the right direction in areas such as gender pay.But much more needs to be done, with less than a quarter of the money disclosed in this year’s list being paid to female stars.The reason why we have had the debate about how much women are paid at the BBC compared to their male colleagues is because the Corporation was forced to publish this data – yet I fear that we are still not getting the full picture.It is time for the BBC to stop hiding behind this loophole, provide real transparency and publish the pay of all stars earning more than £150,000, no matter who is writing the cheque.This is something that the Corporation owes to those who pay the licence fee."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/22/4E2C574E00000578-0-image-m-4_1531429839704.jpg","title":"Bath University academics urged stop saying know case students feel inadequate","story":"    Academics at Bath University (pictured) have been urged to avoid saying ‘as you know’ in case students will be left feeling inadequateJoanna Williams, a former university lecturer and author, criticised the advice last night.

Four other boys were excluded for a fixed period.An online petition calling for \u0027something to be done\u0027 has gathered more than 2,000 signatures since it was launched in March.

In 2016, Barclays scrapped £8 billion of Lobo loans by converting them to fixed-rate loans, at a cost of £182 million to the bank.Barclays board row over possible £61bn merger with rival...Barclays fraud case kicked out: Blow for the Serious Fraud...Share this articleThe councils’ claim form accuses the bank of ‘deceit andor fraudulent misrepresentation’ as its bankers were secretly rigging Libor, which was ‘integral’ to the rate at which Lobo loans had to be paid back.Many local authorities took out the loans as they appeared to promise lower interest rates than those offered by central government. But the loans remain highly contentious as they gave banks the power to impose new rates at certain points. Borrowers could reject the new terms, but would then be forced to repay the entire loan straight away.Barclays and the local authorities declined to comment. But Lianne Craig, a partner at law firm Hausfeld, which is representing the councils, confirmed it had issued a ‘protective claim’ in the High Court.A full claim is due to be filed in the coming months. In 2015, a parliamentary committee launched an investigation into Lobo loans.          Manchester is among the local authorities launching the action against BarclaysRob Carver, a former derivatives trader at Barclays, described the loans as ‘horrible stuff’, telling MPs: ‘I do not think anyone who fully understood it would do it.’Crippling repayment rates of 7 to 9 per cent were attached to some of the loans and are thought to have cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds in interest a year.The 14 local authorities – Bristol, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Kirklees, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, North East Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Oldham, Sheffield, South Gloucestershire, Walsall and West Yorkshire – launched the action. They are preparing to put a number to the total value of the claim if Barclays seeks to defend the action, rather than settle.The councils say the loans – entered into between 2004 and 2010 – should be rescinded with fees returned. They also want compensation for damages.On June 27, 2012, the Financial Services Authority, the precursor to the Financial Conduct Authority, fined Barclays £59.5 million over manipulation of Libor – the London interbank offered rate. Some Lobo loans were directly linked to Libor rates, and many others were influenced by it. In some cases, repayment rates rose if Libor rates fell out of a certain range.Joel Benjamin, of Debt Resistance UK, said: ‘It’s high time banks were made to pay to clean up their own mess.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/16/4E3D2B2900000578-0-image-m-5_1531583925313.jpg","title":"TANA RAMSAY explains exercise helps deal family trauma","story":"    Tana Ramsay, pictured, uses her daily run as an excuse to cry and screamThere is much for Tana Ramsay to be grateful for today. But the wife of sweary television chef Gordon Ramsay, now head of a £43 million restaurant empire, is not immune to shedding a few tears every now and again – indeed, she says, it’s a necessity.Running around Wimbledon Common in South-West London, as Tana does several times a week with the family’s two dogs, she allows herself to cry and occasionally, even, to scream. For the last couple of years have wreaked a heavy emotional toll.There was the devastating loss of their son, the couple’s fifth child, when Tana had a miscarriage at 21 weeks. Then, last year, a bust-up between Gordon and Tana’s father, Chris Hutcheson – who used to run Gordon Ramsay Holdings – ended at the Old Bailey, with the latter jailed for six months for hacking into Gordon’s emails.Earlier it was revealed that Chris had a secret second family, with grown-up children. ‘It’s easy to put a smile on and say, “Everything is absolutely fine!” ’ says Tana.‘But when you’re running, with your music on, you can cry. You can scream. That’s important. You can’t keep it in because it comes back to haunt you if you haven’t processed it. That’s what causes long-term problems.’DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: Keep your blood sugar in check... even if...The many reasons for buying a Georgian house... they\u0027ve got...Share this articleThere is no sign of this emotional turmoil today. Tana, 43, is glowing with good health. She reveals that her father, now 70, is out of jail and competed in his 90th marathon in April this year – alongside his grandchildren.So they’re all back in touch? ‘Oh yes, absolutely,’ Tana says. She won’t say more, but it’s evident that Chris is now very much part of the family again. Whether he and Gordon have patched up their differences is less clear.And Tana, like her father, is arguably in the best shape of her life. She runs marathons, has completed a half-ironman, and is currently training for the London Triathlon to raise money for the couple’s charity, the Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, which has donated £850,000 to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital since 2015.          Tana, pictured centre with husband Gordon, right, and from left son Jack, family friend Alexander Dundas, and daughters Holly and MatildaIt is exercise, more than anything, which has helped the family cope with the tribulations of the past two years.‘What it does is allow you to process things,’ she says.‘Whether it is cycling and chatting together, or running and having a cry on your own, you have to have that release. You also have to have those moments where you allow yourself to feel really sad, when you’re thinking, “Why me?” We’re all going to think like that occasionally. It means we can handle it. It has drawn us together as a family.‘It’s also important to talk with the children and not just think everything is fine. Gordon’s a really big one for talking. Sometimes I just say to him “Seriously?”, and he’s like: “No, we have to talk about it.” Sometimes that’s irritating.’          The Ramsay\u0027s pictured here with Victoria Beckham, centre, are an incredibly sporty familySport runs through almost everything the Ramsay family does. The couple’s four children – Megan, 20, twins Jack and Holly, 18, and Tilly, 16 – compete variously in swimming, netball, rugby, ju-jitsu, hockey and water polo. Their schedule is frenetic: Tana shrugs at the idea that she’s a supermum, but it is impressively well-orchestrated.Jack can be dropped off at school in Dulwich, South-East London, by 6.30am, and Tilly and Holly to their school in Richmond by 7.30am, which leaves Tana time to have a run on Wimbledon Common with the dogs by 7.50am. She’s home by nine, showered and at work at her beauty salon in Battersea by 9.30am.There’s also a home gym – which the whole family uses – and gruelling three-hour cycle rides at the weekends. It’s precisely because the kids are so busy that you won’t see them falling out of nightclubs like other celebrity offspring.‘I don’t worry about the kids going off the rails because they have sport,’ she explains. ‘Yes, they’re teenagers and they’re all on Instagram doing those weird pouts. How could they not be?‘All I can do is make sure they have a healthy relationship between their body and food. Exercise is good not only to keep in shape but mentally it’s fantastic, and a great discipline for kids. Showing them we do it, and instilling that attitude in them, is so important. They’ve been studying for A-level and GCSE exams and I’ve said, “Do a couple of hours of exercise and your brains will work better.”‘I do think it’s helped them to deal with the stress.’Tana admits to following her children on the Find My Friends app, which allows users to see the location of others using GPS. It hasn’t always been reassuring.‘Jack went out after his exams,’ she says. ‘I woke up and it was 5am and he wasn’t home. I’d promised I wouldn’t call because he’s 18, so I went on the app and then saw he was at St Thomas’ Hospital so I freaked and rang him, but tried to sound relaxed. In fact, he was just getting in an Uber.’Tana has run nine marathons and Gordon has competed over a dozen. When Megan turned 18 – the minimum age to take part – she begged to be allowed to do it too. Jack and Holly competed for the first time this year, while Tilly, who has her own CBBC show, Matilda And The Ramsay Bunch, is ‘chomping at the bit’ to have her chance.GORDON, 51, naturally, has the best time (3.30) – ‘have you seen his thighs?’ – followed by Tana, a respectable 25 minutes behind. All of them except Tilly, who will be on a water polo tour, are taking part in the London Triathlon on August 4 to 5. Surely there must be competition? Tana laughs. ‘Between Jack and Gordon it can get pretty intense,’ she admits. ‘But Jack hasn’t beaten me at the marathon yet. They all make me incredibly proud, and I get very emotional.‘There’s so much pressure on them already with social media, so the more normal we keep it the easier it is as a family to just be us, and for them to have the confidence to be themselves.’Tana is clearly comfortable in her own skin, and felt no pressure to stay in shape as Gordon’s celebrity rose. They married in 1996 when he was head chef at Aubergine in Chelsea – now he has 35 restaurants across the globe and seven Michelin stars, along with TV projects in the UK and US.The couple count the Beckhams among their closest friends, so does Tana train with Victoria? ‘No, although when we’re in America we do go to Soul Cycle classes together. I’d love to get Victoria in an ironman competition.’ Tana looks mischievous. Would she do it? ‘No, I doubt it. She’d look at me like I was some kind of maniac, I imagine.’Tana obviously sees things differently – for Gordon and her, exercise is a release. The couple take long cycle rides together on Sundays, completing up to 60 miles a time over the Surrey hills as part of their triathlon training.‘We’ve always been good at spending time away from the kids, just the two of us. Finding something which helps you remember what you like in that person, after so many years of marriage, is great. Gordon might have been away all week in the US, but we’ll go out early in the morning and spend several hours on our bikes and catch up.‘For me, a mum in my 40s, it’s also about doing something just to feel good about myself. I’ve given the kids all of my attention for all of these years, so it’s time for me. I really enjoy it – it’s so social.’Food, perhaps unsurprisingly, is important in the Ramsay household but Tana insists they have ‘a good balance’. ‘I never obsessed over having perfect food for the kids at all times,’ she says. ‘I never watched over them at parties, never said, “Don’t eat this.” I didn’t want to be a helicopter mum, forever hovering over them.‘We’ll have chocolate in the fridge, but our meals are usually healthy. That’s how it should be.’They try to eat together as a family as much as possible but their conflicting schedules mean it happens ‘maybe once or twice a week’.Breakfast is ‘a slice of toast while running down the stairs’, she says. When asked if the children are talented cooks, she pauses before sniggering: ‘They do cook.’Refreshingly, too, there’s no special ‘training diet’ as she prepares for the triathlon. Tana has always run and once finished a 5km in a very good time of 19 minutes. The London Triathlon involves a 750m swim (‘longer than it sounds’, she jokes, grimly), then a 20km cycle ride followed by a 5km run.It’s for a great cause. The Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, set up in 2014, has 235 competitors signed up to Team Ramsay, and money raised for Great Ormond Street has, in previous years, funded research projects and intensive-care equipment.Does she see herself doing it at 80? ‘My father has just had a hip replacement and has been on this health regime. He’s lost a stone in three weeks and ran his 90th marathon in April with three of his grandchildren and one of his sons. I’d like to aspire to that.‘At 80, I want to have energy, I want to be saying to Gordon, “Let’s go on holiday with our bikes and panniers, somewhere like Hawaii.”‘Enjoying our time after working so hard, just ambling around. That’s how I see us.’    Start in a low lunge, with one knee down and the other leg forwards. Then, engaging your core muscles, switch legs.

Around me an army of eager, Lycra-clad men and women stand in neat rows, shoulder width apart, eyes widened. Ear-bleedingly loud dance music pumps through the speakers as Heidi and Chris Powell – the stars of US hit reality show Extreme Weight Loss – take the stage to lead an exercise class that will help us reach our ‘pain threshold’ and ‘burn optimum body fat’.Someone in the crowd screams. Another cries. It’s not yet 7.30am. Welcome to the first day of the world’s biggest fitness convention: Idea World, in San Diego, southern California.Dubbed the ‘superbowl of the fitness industry’, the annual event brings together more than 200 fitness industry professionals, trainers and celebrity weight-loss gurus, alongside 14,000 exercise fanatics from all around the globe.They flock to the four-day festival to find the latest innovations and trends in workouts, equipment and technology on offer. And what debuts here quickly makes its way into gyms across the Atlantic.Justin Webb: Why I\u0027ll stick with walking my labradoodle...I can cry and scream when I\u0027m running: TANA RAMSAY explains...Share this articleThe expo has launched countless products, machines and exercises during its 36-year run, from vibrating power plates to Zumba.As a long-time exercise-avoider with minimal muscle mass, I’ve always struggled to find an exercise class I enjoy. So, as the only British journalist invited to attend this year, would I discover one I could actually bear?COULD I GET MADONNA’S BOTTOM?The exhaustive list of almost 400 classes, workouts and evening activities at Idea World is overwhelming I commit to 25 classes over a period of 48 hours.Only the most sweat-inducing make my cut.After the Powells’ Extreme Transformation Workout, an endless series of muscle-toning exercises performed for three minutes at a time, I move on to a BOSU class: exercises practised aboard a squishy rubber dome.Instructor Alison demonstrates how to ‘paddle’ with my steel bar in hand, engaging the core and glutes for ‘bums and tums’ tightening.          Over the course of 48 hours, Eve tried out 20 different work outs at the Idea World fitness convention in San Diego, CaliforniaFinding my balance on the rubber sphere is tough enough let alone extending opposite arm and legs simultaneously. Remarkably, by focusing on a spot on the wall in front of me, I’m able to complete the rest of the routine with minimal wobbling.After Tae Bo, a mixture of martial arts and aerobics, comes Booty Barre – a class especially designed to build a beautiful bottom.The workout – whose fans include Madonna – draws on the principles of Pilates and ballet.As a regular Pilates goer, I was fairly confident I’d get through the hour with ease, but after five minutes of thrusting with a medicine ball between my legs – on tiptoes – I realise this isn’t the case.By the end of the class, my thighs are like jelly and I’m starving hungry. It’s 10am.BOOT CAMP, BOXING... AND BATTLE ROPESI decide to get the worst out the way before lunchtime: army boot camp.Developed by a former US sergeant, this is a 90-minute sweatathon involving jumping squats, lunges and sprints interspersed with military-style marches. Angry orders from Sergeant Ken Weichart (aka Sgt Ken) to ‘Embrace The Pain!’ keep me moving despite the agony but after 50 rapid squats and the sergeant’s demands to ‘get lower’, I succumb to the pain and embarrassingly stumble mid-rep. ‘No quitters here!’ Ken loudly reminds me.I manage a 30-minute lunch break before leaping straight into the on-site boxing ring for a couple of rounds with a bullish, bald-headed former champ.          This odd-looking device is supposed to provide a work out for bums and tumsTo my surprise, I can throw a mean punch and even manage a spin, kick and smack move.Then I move across to Battle Ropes. After 15 minutes of tutorial, we experiment with all 30 ways a 55 lb, 50ft rope can be moved about for a vigorous full-body workout.It’s not all about waving it with the hands – try jumping between two ropes for a quick warm-up, or lifting the ropes in between press-ups to work the core and arms. At the end of the class, I unashamedly collapse on the floor into a pool of my own sweat and admit defeat. Tomorrow is another day…TORTURE... FOR KILLER ABSOn day two, I explore the 500,000 square foot exhibition hall showcasing almost 400 cutting-edge fitness gadgets and machinery.I start with a demonstration of the latest vibrating Power Plate to hit US gyms. The machine stimulates muscles with vibration, increasing muscle tone when exercising. I expect to watch my love handles wiggle off my body without moving but unfortunately, some work is required. I try step-ups and single leg balances, before moving on to planks, bridges and seated crunches – all aboard the vibrating platform. Each exercise feels ten times more intense than I’d ever experienced before, with ripples of pain shooting through my entire body.Converts claim that those ten minutes of excruciating torture are the fastest route to killer abs.Other highlights of the exhibition include a 6ft stair-climbing machine which, on maximum resistance, feels five times harder than normal stairs a virtual-reality treadmill that sends me running through the French countryside and a cycling machine called Real Ryder which tilts 22 degrees and emits stimulating vibrations. I disembark the bike, feeling two stone lighter, and seek out an upper-body exercise to give my legs some well-earned rest.

The pair were engaged and set to exchange contracts on a £1.6 million family home in West Sussex when he left for a coffee and never came back          Winter, pictured here on the couple\u0027s first-class flight to Dubai in 2013, claimed his family’s assets had been frozen and his own money was tied up because of his orce proceedingsLast week, a High Court judge awarded her a sum just over that amount in a civil fraud case she brought against Winter. However, Sacher, now 48, says the emotional price has been far greater.Speaking about her ordeal for the first time, she reveals that Winter, the 44-year-old son of wealthy businessman and Tory party donor John Winter, spun a web of lies from the beginning, telling Sacher he owned property, a gold bullion account, a £100,000 wine collection and a share of a boat in Monaco, and received £2 million a year in idends. Most cruelly, he told her he had prostate cancer.‘I thought I’d found my soulmate,’ she says.‘We laughed every day and I loved him deeply. Little did I know I was sleeping next to a monster.’Sitting in the cramped one-bedroom flat she now rents in West London, Sacher admits she used to dismiss women like her. ‘I’ve read this story before and thought, “Silly woman. It would never happen to me.” But Richard Winter is a silver-tongued conman. Even now I have to pinch myself. I look back now and think, “Was I that gullible?” Yes, but in my defence I believe he groomed me. It didn’t cross my mind that he was constantly scheming against me. I’m not a stupid girl, but I feel absolutely stupid and utterly betrayed.’Sacher says she was vulnerable when she met Winter in 2011. Her five-year marriage had ended in orce and her confidence was low. Winter told her he was separated from the mother of his two children. In retrospect, Sacher now realises the warning signs were there from the beginning.          Sacher said she would loan Winter money from a £550,000 nest egg she received from her own orce (pictured together on his 40th birthday)          Sacher says she was vulnerable when she met Winter in 2011. She added: ‘He mirrored everything I liked. Most men hate beach holidays, but Richard loved lying in the sun reading a book\u0027 (pictured together at a wedding in Italy in 2014)‘We were in each other’s pockets,’ she says. ‘He mirrored everything I liked. Most men hate beach holidays, but Richard loved lying in the sun reading a book. We had the same taste in food and music. He’d even like to watch romcoms. At the time I thought, “Wow! This is fabulous.” On reflection, he was making himself perfect. He lulled me into a false sense of security.’Winter indicated he came from a wealthy background and was the beneficiary of two trust funds. He also said he had sold a business for £5 million.‘He threw his money around like confetti,’ Sacher says. In their first year they went on a series of luxury holidays and Sacher recalls a lunch at The Savoy Hotel in London during which Winter ordered a £1,000 bottle of red wine, saying: ‘This is how it is for me. Relax, enjoy it.’‘It was like a whirlwind, my feet didn’t touch the ground,’ she says. ‘I now see it was part of his plotting so when he asked to borrow money I didn’t see any risk.’Fraudster who once posed as the Duke of Marlborough and...How this photo (and his wife\u0027s £100-an-hour yoga habit)...Share this articleKeen to impress, Richard took her on regular shopping trips and showered her with expensive gifts from Harrods – where staff even knew him by name. Presents included two Rolex watches costing tens of thousands of pounds. One had the inscription: ‘Thanks for making me smile again.’The mask began to slip in May 2012 when Winter claimed his family’s assets had been frozen and his own money was tied up because of his orce proceedings.Sacher had a nest egg of £550,000 from her own orce. She says: ‘We agreed I would loan Richard the money until his was all unfrozen. He’d been so good to me and I thought it was right to give and take. I gave him access to my accounts because effectively it was his money.’ They continued to live a life that most people can only dream about, but later on that year Sacher grew concerned.Perhaps sensing he was on borrowed time, Winter unleashed his most unforgivable tactic yet: telling Sacher he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.Deeply concerned, Sacher paid for therapy sessions for him, even sitting in on one: ‘Richard would sob, but they were just crocodile tears. Then it all stopped. He said he was feeling better, that it was the slowest-growing cancer and would take a long time to have an impact. I accepted that.’Soon afterwards, he proposed. He took her to Cartier to try on three engagement rings he had picked out especially. ‘Again, they knew his name in the shop and had flown one of the rings in from France,’ she says.          After Sacher became concerned about their spending, Winter unleashed his most unforgivable tactic yet: telling Sacher he had been diagnosed with prostate cancerShe chose an oval diamond ring costing more than £100,000. But it never materialised – and neither did the wedding. Meanwhile, the spending continued, Sacher using some of her nest egg herself. In January 2013, Winter booked first-class tickets to Dubai.‘I know it sounds stupid and gullible, but I loved and trusted him. Also, after his diagnosis, I couldn’t put pressure on him.’ He would later admit to Sacher that he had lied about his cancer diagnosis.Even when Sacher’s money ran out later that year, she believed everything would turn out for the best. She sold her Range Rover for £40,000 and pawned jewellery to raise funds so that they could rent a cottage in West Wittering, West Sussex.When Winter’s orce came through a year later, she asked about repayment.‘Richard said his father wouldn’t release the assets. I started thinking, “Here’s a new excuse.” ’He reassured her by saying his main concern was for her to feel her money was secure and had his lawyers draw up a loan agreement. And they were as happy as ever. Winter started looking at family homes to buy when his funds became available.He settled on a four-bedroom house on the market for £1.6 million and a bungalow nearby for Sacher’s parents. ‘He took builders around and had grand plans for renovations,’ Sacher says. In February 2015, on the day they were due to exchange, they both woke up excited about their future. But for Sacher the feeling would be fleeting.She recalls: ‘Richard left me hoovering and nipped into town for a coffee. He never came back.’It was about two weeks before she received a call from him. ‘He had a story and said he’d had to hand in his phone.’ He promised he would get Sacher’s money back and she was so in thrall to him that their relationship continued.She explains: ‘I was hanging on to any word or hope that he was genuine. He had my financial future in his power.’Winter visited regularly over the next few months, even spending Father’s Day with Sacher’s parents. He promised them he would repay Sacher, sending them a bouquet of roses with a note to say the same.On three occasions he said he would transfer the money, but it never happened. Forced to put the house sale on hold, Sacher then received a letter to say their rent was £10,000 in arrears.She says: ‘I had 24 hours to move out. I was put on the drive with my things in bin bags. I had no money, was in tens of thousands of pounds of debt, and had a dog to care for. I had to sleep on my parents’ sofa.’          Sacher paid for therapy sessions for him, even sitting in on one: ‘Richard would sob, but they were just crocodile tears. Then it all stopped. He said he was feeling better, that it was the slowest-growing cancer and would take a long time to have an impact. I accepted that’          Last week, a High Court judge awarded her a sum just over that amount in a civil fraud case she brought against WinterThe last time Sacher saw Winter was just before Christmas 2015.The following month, a friend called her to say that Winter had written on Facebook that he had been in a relationship with another woman since the previous September.Sacher says: ‘The shock was so huge. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat. I could not accept that someone I loved, cared for and trusted could do that to me, or that I was a victim of fraud. I believe it was a sick game to him.’ Desperate, she sued him in the civil courts for fraud.In his judgment, His Honour Judge Rawlings said Winter’s conduct appeared to have been ‘driven principally by his addiction to spending money… rather than any intention to inflict distress’ upon Sacher. She, however, maintains that Winter knew exactly what he was doing. ‘Richard knows the game he played,’ she says. ‘He has never said sorry.’Winter, who is now married and works as a dog-walker, of course sees things rather differently – but declined to comment.Although she won the case, the judge also suggested Sacher had been ‘the author of her own misfortune’ – a statement that clearly stings.She says: ‘When you’re in what you believe to be a loving relationship and the other person turns out to be a liar and a fraudster, how can you be even partly responsible for their behaviour?’After a two-and-a-half-year fight that cost £100,000 in legal fees, Sacher is now concentrating on getting her life back on track, but says the emotional and financial scars will never heal.‘His life has moved on unscathed, but I will always suffer the effects. He hasn’t just taken my money, he’s left me financially and emotionally in the gutter.‘Now he could do the right thing and pay me back my money. I can’t forgive and I will never forget.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/22/4E4005EB00000578-5954497-image-a-13_1531602454372.jpg","title":"Koalas Longleat Six marsupials making history flown 10 000 miles England safari park","story":"    Six koalas are being flown to EnglandWrapped up securely, the southern Australian koala looks very much at home in the arms of Viscountess Weymouth.As well he might, for soon he will be flown 10,000 miles from his natural habitat in Australia to the grounds of Emma Weymouth’s magnificent stately home at Longleat safari park – in a pioneering conservation project aimed at protecting the survival of his species.While northern koalas can be found at Edinburgh Zoo, this will be the first time vulnerable southern koalas have been brought to Europe. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from Adelaide, where they have been in talks with the Australian government, Emma and her husband, Ceawlin, Viscount Weymouth, say they are delighted to be the first in Europe to launch a breeding programme for the vulnerable marsupials.‘These are the most extraordinary and adorable animals,’ Emma says. ‘The koalas we met were real huggers, wrapping their limbs around you almost like an infant. \u0027Some of the koalas here really enjoy the human contact but others are perfectly content doing their own thing. We are privileged to be able to share them and their important conservation message with our visitors, who will absolutely adore them.’Known for doing little more than chewing gum leaves and napping for up to 22 hours a day, koalas are ided into two distinct groups the smaller northern variety, and the southern koala, which has thicker fur and can weigh twice as much.    Helping to save a species: Viscount and Viscountess Weymouth, right, meet an Adelaide koala and his keeper          Lucy Wormaid (left) and Kim Reynolds check on the progress of the building of Koala Creek at Longleat. A new, purpose built habitat for the koalas and wombats from AustraliaCeawlin, a patron for the International Koala Centre of Excellence at Cleland Wildlife Park in Adelaide, added: ‘We will be the only institution outside Australia that will have southern koalas for conservation purposes and the only one outside Australia and Asia that will have any at all.‘The Australian authorities are extremely reticent about sending them abroad because they are so fragile and they have a huge degree of national importance.‘It takes quite a specific skill set and knowledge to look after them. So it’s not something that they do readily, which makes us very proud and honoured that they have chosen to do this with us.’          Six species of Eucalyptus are being grown on the estate to feed the koalasThe six koalas – five females and a male – and two hairy-nosed wombats, thought to be their closest relative, will be flown by private cargo plane to Britain. The animals’ sensitive nature means they will be in the cabin and not the hold. They will go into quarantine 45 days before they fly and, once in the UK, will be moved straight into their new home at Longleat.Devastated Florida man, 29, issues warning after his beloved...Eve the no-longer-bare bear! Heartwarming photos show...Share this articleKoala Creek is a purpose-built facility on the 9,000-acre estate, which is home to lions, tigers, giraffes, gorillas, rhinos, meerkats, monkeys and antelopes. The enclosure includes a stream, eucalyptus trees, climbing poles, naturally themed indoor and outdoor habitats and viewing areas. From Easter next year, visitors will be able to enjoy ‘walk-through experiences’ to visit the animals and raise awareness of the species. VIP guests may even be able to feed them.          Adorable: Emma Weymouth with one of the koalas heading for LongleatLongleat has planted a 4,000-tree eucalyptus plantation, although the koalas’ main food source will initially be supplied by a farm in Devon. The animals are such prodigious eaters of eucalyptus leaves that it has led some to argue that they are ‘eating themselves’ out of their natural environment.‘They are so fragile that we will have to monitor their eating habits very closely,’ says Ceawlin.‘It takes two weeks to digest the leaves they favour, so if a koala stops eating for a day it’s only two weeks later that any problem will manifest. They are very emotionally sensitive so can get stressed easily.’          Lucy Wormaid (left) and Kim Reynolds check on progress of the building of the Koala Creek facility at Longleat, a new, purpose-built habitat for koalas and wombats from AustraliaAlthough they have few natural predators, koalas are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus. But by far their biggest threat is urbanisation. Climate change and land clearing are pushing populations in New South Wales and Queensland towards the edge of extinction.Professor Chris Daniels, director of Cleland, says a lot is riding on the Longleat project. ‘It’s not only a way of helping to ensure that we have a population outside Australia, but we will learn more about their breeding through the studies that will be done there.’Emma adds: ‘They are such beautiful and appealing creatures that we are very excited that they will become part of the Longleat family of animals. And our hope is that this will help to raise awareness of the need to preserve their natural habitat.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/12/4E3158CF00000578-0-image-m-60_1531479952991.jpg","title":"Touching letter Agatha Christie PG Wodehouse reveals firm friendship later years","story":"    Woman of letters: Dame Agatha and PG Wodehouse began corresponding late in lifeThe letters from Dame Agatha are part of an archive of Wodehouse papers which have now been loaned to the British Library by his estate.In one letter, the crime writer reveals her antipathy towards her public and their demands.Writing on May 24, 1971, Dame Agatha says she welcomed how a postal strike had left her cut off from the outside world.The ‘sweet’ consequence of the dispute was the complete absence of ‘fan mail… begging letters’ and ‘requests that you should send articles of personal wear (??

PG Wodehouse, pictured above in 1968She writes: ‘Only nuisance has been that slimmer hips has resulted in a tendency to lose my skirt when I cross a street. Have to be held together by safety pins.’The letters between the two highlight a shared admiration for each other’s work – as well as a mutual distrust of the publishing business which made their names. Dame Agatha tells Wodehouse she is frequently infuriated by proof-readers who insist on ‘correcting’ the grammar of her characters’ dialogue.She says: ‘It really does enrage me, because few people I have ever met do talk grammatically and this includes myself.’Dame Agatha also quickly tired of the numerous national celebrations in 1970 to mark her 80th birthday, writing: ‘Why should people congratulate one for being 80 years old – no damned merit in it.’Wodehouse died on February 14, 1975. Dame Agatha died aged 85 on January 12, 1976.  \u0027Let\u0027s make Jeeves sexy\u0027PG Wodehouse considered sexing-up his best-loved creation Jeeves for the theatre.In a letter to producer Guy Bolton from February 5, 1951, Wodehouse said of a possible comedy to feature the valet and his gentleman master Bertie Wooster: ‘We ought to write a completely new play starring Jeeves – something a bit risky with a lot of sex in it.‘My type of story is apt to be a bit thin on stage… So why don’t we try to get something sexy for a Jeeves play?’The idea of sexing-up Jeeves – perhaps in an attempt to attract an American audience – will surprise readers who know the character only for impeccable manners and unfailing acumen.Eventually, Wodehouse and Bolton wrote the comedy Come On, Jeeves – first performed in 1954."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/21/4E3FD3E600000578-5954585-EVAN_DAVIS_Declared_up_to_259_999_Presenting_110_editions_of_New-m-4_1531600788904.jpg","title":"BBC using smoke mirrors ploy disguise talents real earnings","story":"    FIONA BRUCE: Declared up to £189,999.

His agent did not comment but it is thought his payments for The One Show and Countryfile are funnelled through BBC Studios.The BBC\u0027s list of top earners – whose salaries are published in income brackets of £10,000 – has dropped from 96 to 64 in the Corporation\u0027s latest accounts.It means BBC stars pocketed almost £19.3 million in 2017-18, compared to £31.1 million in 2016-17. Politicians this weekend voiced fury over the lack of transparency.Writing in The Mail on Sunday, Damian Collins, Chair of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, says: \u0027It is time for the BBC to... provide real transparency and publish the pay of all stars earning more than £150,000, no matter who is writing the cheque. This is something that the Corporation owes to those who pay the licence fee.\u0027Ironically, Lord Hall, the BBC\u0027s Director-General, described his Damascene conversion on the issue of pay transparency to Mr Collins and his fellow committee members in January. Lord Hall, who had led the BBC\u0027s fight to keep earnings a secret, said: \u0027I now understand the transparency in this area is the root to trust in the systems of the BBC.\u0027           DANNY DYER: Declared nothing.

In March, almost 250 BBC staff including Mariella Frostrup, BBC Breakfast\u0027s Naga Munchetty and Victoria Derbyshire signed an open letter that said: \u0027Full publication of inidual salaries and benefits (and other payments through BBC Studios and all commercial arms) would have a lasting positive impact on the culture of the BBC and beyond.\u0027With suspicion over the transparency of BBC pay, some fear that the system may allow the Corporation to create the illusion of cutting costs by giving stars more for work paid through BBC Studios and less for work that contributes to the figures published in annual reports. A BBC spokesman denied this was the case. The latest pay disclosures suggest that some stars are being paid for unspecified work, described in the annual report as a \u0027BBC TV fee for a range of programmes and series\u0027.          MATT BAKER: Declared nothing despite continued high-profile on The One Show and Countryfile, he was not on the list. Hidden up to £499,999 ‘Multi-genre’ work, which earned up to £499,999 last year, is now paid by BBC StudiosOne recipient was Mary Berry, paid up to £199,999 in 2017-18. That does not include payments for work on BBC shows including Britain\u0027s Best Home Cook, Mary Berry\u0027s Country House Secrets and Mary Berry Everyday. The 83-year-old was unavailable for comment but an insider said she may have earned up to £20,000 per episode.Another example is Graham Norton, whose pay of up to £609,999 last year – down by up to £290,000 on the previous year according to the annual report – comprised his weekly show on BBC Radio 2 and a \u0027BBC TV fee for a range of programmes and series\u0027. The figure does not include earnings from the 55-year-old\u0027s weekly chat show, The Eurovision Song Contest or the talent show Let It Shine. His chat show earnings are paid through SO Television Ltd, an independent firm commissioned by the BBC to produce the shows.According to SO\u0027s latest accounts, he earned £2.6 million in \u0027presenter fees, productions fees and royalties\u0027 in 2016. A spokesman for Mr Norton said: \u0027I\u0027m afraid we don\u0027t comment on our clients fees.\u0027A BBC spokesman dismissed claims that the list was misleading. \u0027The BBC leads the way on transparency and we went further than the Royal Charter requires by giving details of the work people did and giving details of pay in the current year as well,\u0027 he said.\u0027The Government has agreed that BBC Studios is a commercial operation not underpinned by the licence fee so, just like the independent production companies it competes for business with, it isn\u0027t required to disclose salaries.\u0027 He insisted the sole reason for setting up BBC Studios was about \u0027securing the future of BBC production\u0027.

U-TURN: Lord Hall initially fought to keep stars\u0027 earnings a secretThe BBC had argued it would lead to an exodus of talent – a so-called ‘poachers’ charter’ – as other broadcasters moved in to steal the Corporation’s best and brightest stars.In reality, a year on, that myth has been dispelled. Far from leading to talent leaving the BBC, the salary disclosures have ignited a debate about equal pay for men and women, ersity on screen and value for money.But this year, something was missing. Nearly £12 million, in fact.Another key part of the Royal Charter agreement was the ability of the Corporation to establish BBC Studios, enabling the broadcaster to use its expertise to create productions for other channels.                             In the whole period of the Charter negotiation, I was worried... about too much transparency from the point of view of competition and people being poached. I now understand that the transparency in this area if the root to trust in the systems of the BBC                        Director-General Lord Hall, January 31 BBC Studios is counted as an independent production company and, in what has become a huge loophole, the stars it pays do not have to appear on the BBC’s list of top earners.This is not right.To be sure, the BBC is moving in the right direction in areas such as gender pay.But much more needs to be done, with less than a quarter of the money disclosed in this year’s list being paid to female stars.The reason why we have had the debate about how much women are paid at the BBC compared to their male colleagues is because the Corporation was forced to publish this data – yet I fear that we are still not getting the full picture.It is time for the BBC to stop hiding behind this loophole, provide real transparency and publish the pay of all stars earning more than £150,000, no matter who is writing the cheque.This is something that the Corporation owes to those who pay the licence fee."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/23/4E405F0800000578-5954757-Despite_his_lifetime_sentence_in_maximum_security_prison_Kaczyns-m-22_1531607956495.jpg","title":"Unabomber Ted Kaczynski says doesnt regret bombing spree","story":"    Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, now 76, was jailed in 1996 for his 18-year package bomb spree that killed three and injured 23It\u0027s been 20 years since Unabomber Ted Kaczynski was jailed for his package bomb spree that killed three people and injured 23 others across the nation.  Despite his lifetime sentence in supermax prison, the 76-year-old former college professor reportedly offers no remorse for his 18-year reign of terror. Writing to a love interest from behind bars he revealed he doesn\u0027t regret a single moment of his bombing campaign. \u0027Do I feel that my actions were justified?

Four other boys were excluded for a fixed period.An online petition calling for \u0027something to be done\u0027 has gathered more than 2,000 signatures since it was launched in March.

This time last week, she had launched her Brexit plan and it had not instantly exploded on takeoff. EU leaders gave the blueprint a polite, if highly guarded, reception. No one flounced out of the Chequers meeting, saying they could no longer sit in her cabinet. Even critics expressed some backhanded praise for the way in which Mrs May choreographed the corralling of her ministers. Opponents revived the old charge, an accusation not heard against her since she blew last year’s election, that an imperious leader had railroaded ministers into signing up to the plan. The poor things had been denied their mobile phones and told that it was a long walk home if they were thinking of quitting.This narrative of a mission triumphantly accomplished survived for a short period even when David Davis resigned and was followed, some 18 hours later, by Boris Johnson, whose departure from the Foreign Office was as chaotic, self-indulgent and self-serving as his time in the post. Mrs May was not entirely surprised. Threats to resign by Mr Davis had become an almost weekly event she would have been happy to see the back of Mr Johnson long ago. Her aides had wargamed likely resignations and thought about replacements.The outgoing Brexit secretary drew some of the sting from his resignation by declaring that he had not quit with the intention of trying to bring down the prime minister. The departure of the foreign secretary was openly celebrated by his own officials and unlamented by everyone else. By getting other cabinet Brexiters, notably Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom, to publicly own her plan, the Tory leader appeared to have pulled off a tactical coup by splitting the Brexiters between Compromisers and Quitters.Yet for all that superficially successful politicking, her Chequers gambit has not stood the test of time. Barely more than a week later, it is already turning to dust. And her premiership is back in “turmoil”, to quote one of the few trustworthy things said by Donald Trump.He wasn’t the central cause of her renewed miseries, but the American visitor certainly deepened them by displaying a viciously blatant contempt for his host. He savaged her plan in remarks to Britain’s biggest-selling newspaper, which were published just as he was having dinner with the prime minister. His subsequent attempts to bind up some of the lacerations he inflicted on his host only drew attention to how severe the wounds were. His suggestion that Mrs May had betrayed the Brexit vote and “killed” any prospect of a trade deal with the United States hurt her in two ways. This supplied ammunition to the fundamentalists in her party. At the same time, the Trumpian rampage underlined for Remainers what folly it is for Britain to be separating itself from Europe just at the moment when there is a rogue president in White House.He made things worse, but neither he nor the resignations from the cabinet are the fundamental problem for Mrs May. It is the maths. People have started to do the parliamentary maths. Lyndon Johnson, who was majority leader in the US Senate before he became his country’s president, once declared that the most important talent in politics is “the ability to count”. There aren’t enough people who can count around Mrs May. The fatal flaw in her plan is that there is no majority for it in the House of Commons.The Brexit ultras are crying treachery and promising havoc. They both express and feed the furies of Tory activists. The Brextremists don’t have an alternative plan, other than to crash out of the EU without any deal at all, a catastrophic outcome that some of them actually wish for, but that hasn’t stopped them before and won’t curb them now. Jacob Rees-Mogg and his cabal can muster the 48 signatures of Tory MPs that they need to trigger a confidence vote in Mrs May. They do not sound confident that they have the numbers – they require 159 – to oust her from the premiership. What the ultras can do is make the government’s life even more hellish by prosecuting a “guerrilla war” in parliament. Even if Mrs May could get the EU to accept her plan, 60-plus Conservative MPs are opponents of her version of a Brexit deal. That number will climb if, as is inevitable, she has to make further concessions in Brussels to secure an agreement. There are more than enough Brextremist rebels to block the prime minister in the Commons unless she can get some assistance from the opposition.All this before her proposal has even made serious contact with the negotiators for the EU. The initial response from European capitals was muted because it would have looked mean-spirited to instantly throw the plan back in her face. That is very different to saying that European leaders are just going to accept the ideas presented by the prime minister. They are too polite to say that her white paper is rubbish,\u0026nbspbut there are key parts that they regard as unworkable or unacceptable.Two years have elapsed since the Brexit vote and only now has the government produced a negotiating position that the EU can engage with. In that wasted time, the atmosphere of the talks has become terribly sour. Even if the EU is prepared to entertain Mrs May’s proposed split in the single market between goods and services – and that’s one of several very large ifs – reaching a deal is bound to involve more concessions in Brussels and to the economic realities of Brexit.So Mrs May’s grand plan has left her stranded in no woman’s land. She can’t go back. Abandoning her plan and retreating behind her old red lines might win a temporary respite from the furies of the Brexit ultras, but that relief would be purchased at the cost of shredding what remains of her authority over the government and destroying what’s left of her credibility in Europe. Mrs May can’t stand still, not for very long anyway, because the EU won’t buy her plan as it is and she hasn’t got a majority for it in parliament. She can’t go back. She can’t stand still. She can only go forward. If, that is, she has any strength left to go forward. That would involve taking further steps towards a softer version of Brexit, a move that would arouse even more intense rage against her from within her party.The oasis in the desert was a mirage. There is no relief\u0026nbspon the horizon from Mrs May’s agonies. The desiccated woman is still sucking up hot sand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98eb3e81bb3909ab116a3090a3dfe23b0eac6b89/70_82_2745_1647/master/2745.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f93068a42473a9440e70f4ce769bdfd","title":"why boaty mcboatface had to be torpedoed david attenborough","story":"When it comes to important stuff such as naming boats or theatres, petitioners can’t always have the casting voteThe hull of the ship they’re not actually going to call Boaty McBoatface is complete.

Idiots!I genuinely think it’s a very funny name – I’ve thought about it many times and it continues to amuse me. Not because it sounds inherently hilarious, like a fart or a burp or a well-timed honk, but because it seems to come from such a dismissive and flippant point of view. “Who cares what the sodding boat is called?” it proclaims. It’s so disdainful of the patronising condescension that the whole notion of asking the public what a boat should be called, as if they’re children and it’s a Blue Peter hamster, absolutely reeks of.It’s a sign, incidentally, of Sir David Attenborough’s colossal, ocean-going credibility that his name was the one chosen to supplant such a good joke. Jo\u0026nbspJohnson, the then minister for universities and science who overruled the Boaty McBoatface vote, must have instinctively sensed that people would go along with it being named after Attenborough. Nobody resents Attenborough. Anyone would feel churlish objecting to its being named after him.In other humourless name-changing news, I learned last week that the Tricycle theatre in Kilburn, just round the corner from where I lived for 10 years, has been renamed the Kiln theatre. This sounds like Prince\u0026nbspCharles saying “the Kilburn theatre”. Perhaps they’re hoping he’ll come and cut the ribbon when it reopens after its £7m refurbishment this autumn – make the whole place feel a bit more royal and posh. It would be a surprising change of direction for an edgy off-West-End arts venue, but then The Crown has been huge for Netflix\u0026nbspand that whole postwar meritocracy drive seems to have pretty much petered out, so perhaps we’d all better get back to social climbing.On reflection, I don’t think it’s meant to sound posh. The theatre’s artistic director, Indhu Rubasingham, explained that “we felt the name reflected our home in Kilburn. And a kiln is also a space for transformation, so we felt it fitted in with our ideas of what we should be all about.” A kiln is a space for a pretty predictable sort of transformation – not the sort you’d want to sit and watch. More akin to paint drying than a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, but I accept that the word shares four of the seven letters of its location’s name, and maybe that’s good.I’m not the only naysayer. Rubasingham’s direct predecessor, Nicolas Kent, who ran the Tricycle from 1984 to 2012, described the decision as “tragic” and “a commercial misstep”. There’s also a protest group calling for it to be reversed and an online petition signed by over 1,400 people.I haven’t signed the petition. I don’t like the decision – I can’t see any reason for it other than a self-important\u0026nbspinstinct to tamper with things – but it’s not up\u0026nbspto me or to any random online signatories. The\u0026nbspnaming of theatres is not a democratic process but the decision of the people running them. It’s a tiny part of the venue’s artistic offering, a creative choice. The rest\u0026nbspof us can slag\u0026nbspit off, just like we can slag off any shows we didn’t enjoy, but we cross a line when we dispute their right to make it. If you want to decide what\u0026nbspa theatre is called, get yourself a job running a theatre. A few thousand votes from people who don’t know what they’re talking about are no reason to change course.As the Boaty McBoatface saga shows, you can’t always\u0026nbspbow to a snapshot of popular opinion. Who knows why people voted as they did, in what spirit of lashing out against the establishment, of tweaking the nose of the ruling class, without having fully thought through, or been properly informed of, the long-term implications. Sometimes someone has to step in to stop something crazy happening – something terrible that does lasting damage. But only if it’s a really important issue, like a boat being given a silly name."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3f602dffee4cec2fc33f8c49842bbe0787f81b/0_167_5023_3014/master/5023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14077ef3cab8d87897978aac090e6788","title":"pedallers pilgrimage britains best cycling routes","story":"Wild Cycling author Chris Sidwells shares nine of his favourite rides – from the rugged west Highlands of Scotland to the green and pleasant loops of the home counties  These rides are my choices based on a wide variety of cycling experiences. Don’t consider the routes prescriptive – they are merely an introduction to the possibilities for cycling in different parts of the UK. Use them as a basis for your own exploration of nine parts of the country, each offering a unique day’s cycling.Full English: the Chiltern Hills, BuckinghamshireDistance: 37 milesDifficulty: 610Start and finish: Princes RisboroughNearest station: Princes Risborough“England’s green and pleasant land” perfectly describes the Chilterns. Broad-leaf woods overhang deep seductive lanes that wriggle around and over these chalky hills. Red kites rule the sky, and cricket is played on village greens. The Chilterns are commuter country now, but still charming, and still very English.Head for Chinnor on the north-west edge of the hills, then ride towards them to pick up a cycle-way going south-west to Watlingon, where you leave the trail. Climb Watlington Hill, then go through Christmas Common and Turville Heath take a pitstop at the Barn cafe at Turville Heath Farm, which is excellent. Continue to Marlow, then head north-west along the B482, leaving at Stokenchurch, and go north through the lanes to Princes Risborough.The most unexpected: Dengie Peninsula, EssexDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 410 (810 if it’s windy)Start and finish: Burnham-on-CrouchNearest station: Burnham-on-CrouchSqueezed between two rivers, just 24 crow-flying miles from the centre of London, there’s a time capsule called the Dengie Peninsula. For a basic loop, follow the B1021 north towards Bradwell, go left after Tillingham through Maylandsea and Latchington, then follow the B1010 back to Burnham-on-Crouch. You ride through rosy brick and painted clapboard villages, past a patchwork quilt of fields. There are little loops you could add, such as visiting Dengie Marshes where you might glimpse a rare hen harrier. It’s so quiet, so peaceful, it’s like riding through the 1950s. Distance: 45 milesDifficulty: 810Start and Finish: BodminNearest station: Bodmin Parkway A ride of stunning sea views with a taste of wild moorland. Follow the Camel Trail from Bodmin to Wadebridge, leaving at the old bridge for Port Isaac, a beautiful Cornish fishing village and location for TV’s Doc Martin.  Continue north on the clifftop road, then join the B-road to Delabole, where you turn left and descend to Trebarwith Strand and its gorgeous beach. Continue north through Tintagel, for an unmissable mid-ride snack at Pengenna Pasties. Then it’s on to Boscastle, where you head inland through Camelford to St Tudy. Go left just outside St Tudy, to experience Bodmin Moor and its villages, before picking up the Camel Trail back to Bodmin. Best urban ride: the Taff Trail, CardiffDistance: 32 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: Cardiff BayNearest station: Cardiff Central “We’ve had it done up,” the Welsh comedian Rhod Gilbert says when describing Cardiff. And it has been done up, especially the waterfront of Cardiff Bay, where this ride starts. It’s a glorious place to pootle around on a bike. There are plenty of cafes to choose from – but save them for later, when you get back.  The Taff Trail mixes cycle-ways with quiet roads and is well signposted. This ride is 32 miles there and back to Pontypridd, but you can go on to Abercynon in the Rhondda or even do the whole 55-mile-long Taff Trail and reach the Brecon Beacons. The cycle-way sections are ideal for family rides.Best rite of passage ride: the Strines, SheffieldDistance: 22 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: LangsettNearest station: Penistone The Strines is 11 miles of unclassified road on the eastern edge of the Peak District, running from Langsett on the A616 to Moscar Fields on the A57. It’s brutal the road plunges into and out of three steep-sided valleys, with plenty of undulations and exposed moorland in between. Head south from Langsett, keeping right at all junctions, to the A57. Turn around and ride back. The Strines both ways is a local rite of passage, and the hills form part of many local training rides. There are six big climbs if you go both ways, ranging between a third and a half a mile long. Oh, and there’s the Bank View cafe in Langsett. It’s very special. Best cafe ride: Selby, West YorkshireDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: SelbyNearest station: Selby A pleasant ride through quiet lanes with a cafe stop about halfway. Start at Selby Abbey (fact: the Rt Rev Dr John Thompson is actually known as the Biking Bishop of Selby), find the B1223 and go north then west to Sherburn in Elmet. Elmet was an ancient British kingdom covering much of what is now West Yorkshire. From Sherburn go south to Hillam then Birkin for the cafe, the Birkin Fisheries Tea Room, which stands in its own grounds – there’s a lake, the food is delicious and the service always smiling. Once re-fuelled, head east to West Haddlesey, then north to Gateforth and on, north-east, to Selby.  Distance: 35 milesDifficulty: 910Start and finish: UlphaNearest station: Broughton in Furness Two of the steepest road climbs in the UK – plus others, long and short – give this ride a total altitude gain of 1,800 metres. The first seven and a half miles from Ulpha to Cockley Beck has only one climb, then you are at the foot of Wrynose heading east with the pass before you. Engage your lowest gear and haul yourself over – there’s no way of finessing it.  Descend to Little Langdale, climb over to Great Langdale. Go right in Elterwater, right at the next junction for Wrynose, then clamber over Hardknott Pass. Continue to Eskdale Green and turn left for the long slog over Birker Fell and back to Ulpha. This ride hurts – but the satisfaction of doing it lasts a lot longer than the pain it causes.The quietest: the Cheviot Hills, NorthumberlandDistance: 47 milesDifficulty: 710Start and finish: RothburyNearest station: Alnmouth (for a regular service) Rothbury is a country town like country towns used to be – gentle and homely, where people enquire about a person’s health and actually want to know the answer. The ride is out and back, mostly uphill out and downhill coming back, tracing the River Coquet almost to its source.  Follow the B6341 west from Rothbury. Take the first right after Hepple then keep left all the way to the end of the road, where if you stop for a moment you will probably hear no other evidence of human life but the sound of your own breath. Refuelling at the Barrowburn Tea Room near the turnaround point is highly recommended.The wildest: Ardgour and Moidart, west HighlandsDistance: 81 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: Fort WilliamNearest station: Fort William I saved the best till last. Any ride with a ferry crossing starts ticking wild boxes for me, but this gets a lot wilder. It’s mostly on main roads, but they will be the quietest main roads you’ll ever ride. The busiest, the A82, is first, going south-west from Fort William to the Corran Ferry Terminal. Marvel at the mountains as you cross Loch Linnhe. Then it’s on the A861 west through glens, alongside salty sea lochs, over the tip toes of mountains, around the Sound of Arisaig, where the Isles of Rum, Eigg and Muck are grey-green jewels in a sea setting. Finally you’ll head back to Fort William, and in fine weather the whole of Ben Nevis can be seen. Ready to hit the road? Why not make it count?

Now his extraordinary debut film casts an acute eye on the religion he turned his back onMaking a film is always, at almost any given moment, difficult-verging-on-the-impossible, and Daniel Kokotajlo’s first feature was no exception. His backers were expectant his budget was miniature far too many pages of the script over which he had laboured for so long needed to be filmed every single day. And just like any other tyro director, he brought with him all the usual doubts. Why on earth had he insisted on so many locations? What would it be like to give notes to his star, Siobhan Finneran? However, for Kokotajlo, whose quietly controlled screenplay is rooted in his upbringing as a Jehovah’s Witness, there were other, deeper things going on, too. It took this gentle, softly spoken man from Tameside, in Manchester, 21 days to shoot his film, and in that time his beard turned, somewhat dramatically, from mostly brown to mostly grey. “I lost loads of hair, as well,” he says, placing a hand ruefully on his head. “When we started, I looked about my age, which is 37. By the time we’d finished, I was 10 years older.”Every day brought with it the feeling of transgression. “Even before the shoot, this was a subject I was uncomfortable with,” he says. “As Witnesses, we were told to avoid literature that was critical of us. We were made to feel it was almost on the level of being satanic. When I first got hold of one of these books, not long after I left the religion, I was literally shaking with fear – and when I started working on this project, that fear came right back.” Perhaps, though, this anxiety was also useful. One of the more remarkable things about Apostasy – and there are many it’s hard to imagine a more accomplished debut – is its even-handedness, the way it stirs in the audience sympathy for characters whose beliefs most of us might ordinarily struggle to understand. Kokotajlo nods. “I did feel a pressure to be as accurate and as honest as possible. I didn’t want people still in the religion to be able to say: this is just propaganda. I needed it to be right.” Are Witnesses likely to choose to see it? “That depends. They’ll be advised not to. But if they’re curious, they might. There are the rules, and then there’s what people actually do.”Apostasy is set in Oldham, or a place very like it, and centres on a family of three: Ivanna (Finneran, best known for roles in Happy Valley and Downton Abbey, who is quite superb) and her teenage daughters, Alex (Molly Wright) and Luisa (Sacha Parkinson). Ivanna is a devout Witness away from her job at the council, she spends her time handing out the Watchtower on the street, or at her local Kingdom Hall, listening to the elders preach about Armageddon, which is coming very soon and with it, paradise. Alex is also committed though she suffers from a serious blood condition, she has told her doctor that she would not want a transfusion even if it were a matter of life and death (Witnesses believe that those who respect life as a gift from God do not try to sustain it by the taking of blood, a doctrine they have followed since 1945). Luisa, however, has begun to doubt, and will soon, having become pregnant by her college boyfriend, find herself shunned by her mother and the community. The film is about the three women’s faith, and all the ways in which it is tested. But it’s also, par excellence, about the meagre world they inhabit, a realm that is unnervingly quiet (no music or television), frequently joyless (the Witnesses do not celebrate birthdays, Easter or Christmas, regarding such feast days as pagan), and almost entirely controlled by men (the zealous elders, who rule the roost entirely down at the Kingdom Hall).This is not to say these women are unhappy, precisely that they feel they’re missing out. Ivanna and Alex, if not Luisa, think of Armageddon, after which the Witnesses will spend eternity in paradise on earth, and feel nothing but excitement, a sense of imminent grace and bliss – and while they may be taciturn with each other, they have pretty regular conversations with God. Did Kokotajlo worry about dramatising these conversations? Didn’t those financing his film (it was funded by iFeatures, which is supported by the BBC, the BFI and Creative England) quail at the prospect of a screenplay in which what Alex says to her doctor, and what she says to God, are given equal weight? He smiles (we’re in a Soho hotel which, metaphorically speaking, couldn’t be further from the things we are talking about). “It was hard to convince them what it would look like. But I also realised, and I think they did too, that I could never get across the mindset of the Witnesses, the cognitive dissonance between what they think and what other people think, in a traditional script. The audience needs to understand the weight of their beliefs, the spiritual pressure they’re under. Because that’s what motivates them.”Apostasy will arrive in cinemas just before The Children Act, the film adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel of the same name in which a judge tries the case of a teenage boy who, for religious reasons, refuses the medical treatment that will save his life. Naturally, Kokotajlo has mixed feelings about this. “Why did it have to come out at the same time as ours?” he wails. He doesn’t, though, believe the two narratives have much in common: “It’s an outsider’s book,” he says. “When I read it, I found myself nit-picking. Ex-Witnesses always say: ‘Oh, that’s not quite right.’” What isn’t in doubt, however, is the fact that Jehovah’s Witnesses are still willing to put their lives in the balance by refusing to accept blood. The Jehovah’s Witnesses were founded by Charles Taze Russell in the US in the 1870s, and there are now around 8 million in 235 countries (in the UK, there are 130,000). A group advocating reform of the blood rules believes that in 2016, at a conservative estimate, the prohibition resulted in some 1,220 deaths worldwide between 1961 and 2016, the same group suggests, more than 33,000 people may have died. “They’ve changed the rules now,” says Kokotajlo. “You are allowed to take various fractions of the component parts of blood. But if you’re in an emergency – a car crash say – that isn’t going to be possible, is it? Your life is still in danger.” He shakes his head. “No, it happens far more often than you realise.”Kokotajlo studied textiles at Manchester politan University, after which he spent several years making a living from painting and hip-hop – and it was in this period, when he was sharing a house with friends, that he discovered film: “I had been looking into my Italian-Ukrainian heritage, which comes from my grandparents, so I was already into Fellini and Pasolini. But when I moved in with those guys, one of them was into British cinema. Until then, it had never crossed my mind that there was such a thing as British cinema outside the mainstream. Mike Leigh, Alan Clark, Anthony Asquith, Terence Rattigan, David Lean… That got me interested. I felt like maybe this was something I could do.”At 27, he left Manchester for a screenwriting MA at Westminster University, a course he funded with his art and a series of bar jobs. Was it helpful? “It was in terms of contacts, moving out of Manchester, and life skills,” he says. “I guess I learned how to communicate with southerners. But then it was a case of: what do I do now?” Eventually, the answer came in the form of a short film called The Mess Hall of an Online Warrior, made for a few hundred quid. “It did quite well at festivals, and I was invited in by Vision Media – the then regional film council – who said they’d fund another one.” It also having done well at festivals, he began developing Apostasy in 2015 by November 2016, shooting was under way. Did he always know his first full-length film would be about the Witnesses? “No, no. no. I worked on a few scripts before it. Maybe I was scared of it. I didn’t want to upset my family.”When did he start to doubt? “It was a very slow process. The first thing I noticed was that I didn’t feel comfortable with the way women were treated. It might have been a wedding ceremony: all the scriptures they were pulling out were about women needing to be capable wives and men being the head of the house they were using lots of very disturbing phrases. Then I went to college, and that was the key, really. People would ask my opinion on something, and I would be scrambling round trying to find an answer in a text somewhere – because that’s what life as a Witness is like. It’s group thinking based on the interpretation of a text. I looked back at the meetings, and I began to see what was going on.”Kokotajlo, who thinks of himself as an agnostic now, attended his last meeting at the Kingdom Hall when he was 22 or 23 his siblings have also since left the church. How does his mother feel about this? “I’m not sure. I still have a good relationship with her. For a long time afterwards, she would still ask me to come back to meetings she still does, sometimes. But Witnesses just expect you to come back: it’s like northerners thinking you’re just going through a silly phase of living in the south.” He laughs. Is it still a part of him, though? Surely it must be. “It is, yes,” he says, softly. “I feel like I’ve dealt with it now, having made the film, but it is still a part of me. You’ve got these ideas and values in life. I’m compassionate. I do my best to listen to people. But it’s a tough one: is that the religion, or is that just how I am?” Does he miss the certainty of belief, or is it liberating to be free of it? “It was liberating when I first left. I remember when I first read Darwin. Wow, I thought. This makes so much more sense than the Bible. But then, when we joined the Witnesses, I felt the same way: there was this key to the universe, and everything was clear. There was an elitism in it. All these idiots around us, we thought: they don’t know. I used to feel quite smug, and maybe I’m still looking for that. Perhaps I want to be part of a cult-like group. When I first left, it was about music. Now it’s film.”How does he feel about Apostasy’s imminent release? “Nervous, excited, proud.” His mother hasn’t seen it, and probably won’t. But at every festival at which it has been screened, he has been touched to see the turnout of supportive ex-Jehovah’s Witnesses. “Some of it is really emotional,” he says. “There have been people who took blood and were then shunned. Even in London, there were people who had been shunned.” As for secular audiences, who will bring to the cinema their own prejudices and misconceptions, perhaps by spending time with Ivanna, they will come to see the world, albeit briefly, through her eyes. Certainly, this is his hope. The squat, bleak, redbrick Kingdom Hall where she worships in the film stands on a dual carriageway, a road that works quite brilliantly as a metaphor, the world zooming past while inside everyone inside sits quite still, waiting for its end. But for all her zealotry, Ivanna is human after all. Her love for her daughters might be horribly muddled, but it is still love, nevertheless.Apostasy is in cinemas on 27 July.

He’s best known for his comedic TV roles as bumbling intern Will in W1A, Prince William in The Windsors, and as Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s on-off boyfriend in Fleabag. He has also appeared in period dramas Poldark, Our Zoo and Harlots. This summer he plays Harry, the younger version of Colin Firth’s character, in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, the sequel to the hit 2008 musical romcom that opens in cinemas on Friday.How does it feel to play a young Colin Firth?Doing Mamma Mia was scary full stop, so playing a young Colin Firth was even more intimidating. I just had to keep reminding myself that I was playing Harry and not Colin Firth, which psychologically felt better. I was worried Colin would want the younger him to be played by an Abercrombie \u0026amp Fitch model, but he was very gracious.Do you fancy doing other “young Colin Firth” roles now? Maybe a young Mr Darcy?What a thought. I wouldn’t want to sully his body of work like that. In your first scene you’re wearing a skimpy dressing gown, talking terrible Franglais. Was that quite an entrance?Well, I like playing people who are crap at things and Harry is crap at French, so that sat well.How was it filming your big musical number, Waterloo? It’s a rare role that involves playing air guitar with a baguette…Sadly, it is quite rare. It was nerve-racking but they choreographed it to our inidual abilities – which is why other people are backflipping over tables and doing cartwheels across the room, while I play baguettes or ride trolleys. Everyone else was a professional dancer. I was quite obviously not.You’re quite a mover, though. Fancy doing Strictly Come Dancing?I can’t imagine they’d ever ask me, but yeah, sure. It’s a great programme. And it’s weird how quickly you get used to spray tans. You might smell of biscuits but you feel fabulous.Did you get to hang out with veteran co-stars like Pierce Brosnan, Julie Walters and Meryl Streep?Yes, especially on location in Croatia. It was surreal to start with, so many famous faces in one film, but they were all so generous with their time. We had lots of dinners and drinks. There was a definite onus on cast bonding. It was ridiculously fun.The mighty Cher plays the mother of Meryl Streep’s character. Did you get an audience with her?The whole dynamic changed when Cher arrived. It was like a visit from the Queen: everyone was in complete awe. When I realised my chance to say hi was going, I just made a beeline for her. I probably spoke absolute gibberish, but she was completely lovely.Are you an Abba fan?I didn’t think I was, yet somehow I knew all the songs. It’s like Happy Birthday or the Beatles – ingrained in your brain.In W1A, intern Will became a cult character. That must have been gratifying?I was so excited to get that job because I loved its forerunner, Twenty Twelve. I’d only done theatre and small parts on telly before, so the first time someone recognised me and came over, it was surreal. I thought it was a stalker or I was about to be kidnapped, so I gave her this weird combative stare, until she said: “You’re Will from W1A.” I was, like: “Gosh, sorry.”Did you base Will on anyone specific?I based him loosely on a friend’s brother, who’s very earnest and eager to please. A bloody nice bloke. When I got on set, though, I was so in awe of all the other actors that I was really keen and slightly out my depth. I turned into Will anyway.You also played the protagonist’s boyfriend in Fleabag - another Harry, in fact…I seem to be typecast as Wills and Harrys, but I reckon I could stretch to a Martin or a Warren. I bet I’ve even got an Ian in me.Will you be returning for series two next year?From what I hear, yes. I certainly hope so. I’ve known Phoebe Waller-Bridge for a decade. We graduated from drama school at the same time and were in a play at the Bush theatre together. She was always leading projects and creating stuff, even back then, so I’m not surprised she’s a complete star now.You played a resistance officer in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. How was that?I didn’t know what was going on, to be honest. It’s all so secret, they can’t really tell you what you’re playing. But it was extraordinary to be on a production of that scale. You’d walk into the studio and it would have a huge planet with a moving spaceship in the middle. On the call sheets in the morning, it would say “50 aliens, 100 soldiers, three spaceships”. Other stuff I’ve been in would just say “two chairs”.Don’t people often mistake you for Matt Smith?All the time. Only the other night, I went to see a play and this couple behind me leaned over and said: “Have you met the royals? Do they watch it?” I assumed they were talking about The Windsors, then they said: “You’re not coming back next series, you must be gutted.” I was, like: “Aren’t I?” It gradually dawned on me they were talking about Matt Smith in The Crown.You’re an avid theatregoer. What’s the best thing you’ve seen lately?I loved the first part of The Inheritance at the Young Vic and can’t wait to see the second. The whole cast’s performances were seamless. You couldn’t see the workings.You don’t do the party circuit or social media. Is that a conscious decision?If you’re a character actor, people aren’t quite as interested. I don’t think I’ll ever get chased by paparazzi – which is a good thing. And I just know that if I did Instagram or Twitter, I’d become obsessed with “likes” and go mad. Well, more mad.Is your profession becoming too dominated by public school-educated actors?Yes, I think it is. There are lots of movements aimed at raising awareness and improving ersity – whether that’s privilege, gender or race. That’s hugely important. But I feel slightly weird talking about it as a middle-class white male. Nobody wants to hear this from me, so I’ll shut up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6849815a8b7f68e4812195f6222639be4409ea1/309_0_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1486c4ef7cd75aec18c98e29fe4584a0","title":"incredibles 2 review mark kermode","story":"Slapstick genius, profound social comment and a monstrously funny infant combine to conjure a magical second outing for the superhero familyReviewing The Incredibles for the Observer in 2004, I noted that Pixar was reportedly anxious about the film’s “Bergmanesque” opening act in which a family of retired superheroes struggled with the problems of mundane domesticity. I concluded (wrongly, it transpires): “The Incredibles fails to fulfil the remit of a true family film, which is surely to induce in everyone a sense of magical childlike wonderment.”I realised my error when the film came out on DVD a few months later and promptly became a firm favourite with my then-young children. Yet, contrary as ever, I preferred the appended short Jack-Jack Attack, which followed the mishaps of the babysitter left to tend to the youngest Incredible while the rest of the family were off starring in the main feature.Now the misunderstood “Supers” are back in a sequel in which Jack-Jack shifts towards centre stage, much like the Minions who increasingly stole the spotlight in the Despicable Me series. This time, it’s Bob, aka Mr Incredible (balefully voiced by Craig T Nelson), who’s left holding the baby while his altogether more glamorous partner Helen, aka Elastigirl (a wonderfully wry Holly Hunter), is out fighting crime. She has been enlisted by a shiny-suited PR guru to help rehabilitate outlawed superheroes via a charm offensive involving runaway trains, political lobbying and a “wicked cool” new bike, the Elasticycle (“It’s torquey!”).Back at home, Bob is facing his own challenges: helping Dash with his maths homework, nursing Violet through the traumas of her first teen crush and containing Jack-Jack’s emerging powers, which are as scary as those showcased by the monstrous child in that notorious Twilight Zone episode It’s a Good Life. These include multiplication, transformation, immolation, laser-beam eyes and a Poltergeist-style ability to disappear into the fourth dimension. Oh, and he still needs his nappy changing.With its fab future-retro designs (the architecture and furniture had me drooling) accompanied by Michael Giacchino’s Bond-inflected score, Incredibles 2 has snappy charm to spare. As before, there are plenty of gags aimed specifically at older viewers, such as the burbling news channel that announces that “when it comes to decision-making, people have more faith in a monkey blowing darts than in Congress”. The depiction of the exhausting perils of parenting will strike a chord with many middle-aged audiences, as will Bob’s emasculated confusion at realising that he’s no longer the centre of attention (“I’m Mr Incredible – not Mr Mediocre or Mr So-So”).There’s a serious movie lurking at the heart of all this hi-tech adventure that takes timely swipes at gender inequality, family stress and the modern triumph of salesmanship over substance.But it’s the slapstick brilliance of Jack-Jack’s erupting powers that really lifts Incredibles 2, making it that rarest of things – a sequel superior to the original. From early giggles to full-bellied guffaws, Jack-Jack’s antics had me in stitches, recalling the violent slapstick of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd a string of superbly executed sight gags that land tangible physical punches. Watching this, I remembered what a bang-up job director Brad Bird made of the action sequences from Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, a film partially shot on Imax cameras to enhance the sheer visceral physicality of its set pieces.Other Incredibles 2 treats include a returning Frozone (Samuel L Jackson), and a ragtag band of wannabe Supers ranging from the starstruck Voyd (Sophia Bush), whose pan-dimensional abilities echo the brilliant videogame Portal, to the vomitous Reflux (Paul Eiding), who likes to put civilians at their ease by saying: “Medical condition or superpower – you decide!”As always with Pixar presentations, the main feature comes with a supporting short, in this case the initially bewildering but ultimately life-affirming Bao, a tale of a woman whose cooking comes to life with wish-fulfilling results. Although Chinese-Canadian director Domee Shi’s exquisitely realised film is both touching and tearjerking, it also includes a WTF moment that alarmingly put me in mind of Fruit Chan’s 2004 shocker Dumplings!Having loved Bird’s 1999 animation The Iron Giant (adapted from Ted Hughes), I confess that my misguided expectations may have prevented me from embracing The Incredibles all those years ago. Yet this boisterous sequel worked its magic and won me over. I may be late to the party, but I now have no hesitation in declaring myself a fully paid-up Incredibles fan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cbf2d30a80c5ce2a427485087b70fcc8aea100e/0_63_5004_3002/master/5004.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2810d7f126b78990d94a7219d6f65f8","title":"luka modric worlds greatest croatia france world cup final","story":"The brilliant Croat has been the driving force behind Croatia’s run to the final. Now he deserves to dethrone Messi and Ronaldo as the finest player on the planetWelcome to the Modric supremacy. Yes, it has been a while. But we’re here now. For Luka Modric the ascent to the summit has been 15 years in the making, from having his ankles hacked raw at Zrinjski Mostar to running more metres aged 32 than any other player at Russia 2018, in the process driving Croatia to the verge of the first genuine small-nation underdog victory in World Cup history.Sport does not normally work like this. Athletes do not improve every year for more than a decade. Small, pigeon-toed men who don’t score goals, and whose elfin on-field presence is reminiscent even now of a small boy dressed up as a witch, do not make the step up to galáctico at the world’s most glamorous club.Except for this one. Right now the only real issue with just doubling up at the Luzhniki Stadium and handing the Ballon d’Or over to the world’s most elusive midfielder is that fact, should things go the other way come December, you might not get it back. Sorry. Yes. Behind you. Gone again. Nope. Floating over there 40 yards away, right on to Ivan Perisic’s big toe.As Russia 2018 reaches its vanishing point in Moscow on Sunday afternoon it seems a good moment to remember that it was billed, quietly but persistently, as a possible changing of the guard in the Fifa star system. It has after all been 11 years now, 11 years of watching the conjoined Messi-Ronaldo godhead duke it out every December for the right to stand in a velveteen gingham tuxedo holding up that prized golden ball.Neymar was the pre-tournament favourite to make that step up in Russia, having spent the past few years being winched into place as the next golden god in waiting. Instead, his World Cup unspooled into a kind of extreme physical comedy. In his absence from the late stages – and we wish Neymar well in his long convalescence – Fifa will have been eyeing the progress of Kylian Mbappé, eager to borrow a little magic dust from the rising star of the world game.Mbappé has been wonderful, and may yet gambol off with the final. But win or lose there is a fair chance a less saleable figure might get his turn come December.Modric for the Ballon d’Or: it is a delicious prospect at a time when star players are fetishised to a bizarrely sensual degree, styled and primped and captured in constant brooding close-up.Croatia’s captain will not be the oldest outfield player as the final kicks off. He does not feature in the list of the top 25 highest-paid players in the world. Kit aside, he does not appear to have any headline personal sponsors. He is, instead, the ultimate high-grade component, the player who drives the player who drives the player who scores the goal, the part that makes every other part function with more vim and more precision.To wonderful effect in the last three years. A World Cup final follows the Champions League “three-peat” with Real Madrid. A winner’s medal would complete a run of personal success equalled only by the Bayern Munich-West Germany cross-over of the 1970s – Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller, Sepp Maier and friends.Of course, none of these were playing for Croatia, the second-smallest nation ever to compete in a World Cup final. Modric’s influence on this feat has been profound. He tops the metrics: more steps run, more passes made than anyone at the World Cup who isn’t a Spaniard. Most minutes played by a Croatian, most touches, most dribbles completed. Not that any of this has ever been his measure.Watching Modric on a good day is like being drawn into a slow-building piece of music, not something with a snappy intro or a thunder of percussion at the start but something absorbing and rhythmical and clipped, where suddenly the parts start to chime together, the phrases to expand and repeat and find deeper melodies until you can’t imagine wanting to listen to anything else.Modric dragged the semi-final away from England in stages, never hurried, just steadily asserting his craft. It is an ability to read the tides and find a weak spot that England first saw back in 2007 when the 22-year-old Modric quietly traumatised Wayne Bridge at Wembley, playing a series of horrible, malevolent little passes inside England’s left-back, at one point forcing Bridge to punt the ball back on to his own bar.Still, though, a Modric Ballon d’Or would be a break with recent tradition, an anti-glamour move. The last unshowy Ballon d’Or was Fabio Cannavaro in 2006, since when Xavi and Andrés Iniesta have had a podium finish. Otherwise, it’s goalscorers all the way. And this is a midfielder who has scored only nine league goals for Real Madrid in six years.But then, Modric has always had to listen to what’s wrong with him before he gets the chance to show what’s right. Anyone surprised by his anger at the triumphalism of certain English pundits probably hasn’t been watching. This is what gets him going. The story of that tough early life has been told many times, from the wartime murder of his grandfather by Serbs near the family home, to a refugee existence at the Iz Hotel in Zadar, to the poverty that saw his father make young Luka wooden shin-pads so he could play matches (a story Modric has since raised an eyebrow at). Even now Modric has become a isive figure in his moment of triumph. “Luka Modric, you little piece of shit,” was a familiar chant among Croatia fans during the last year, a reference to Modric’s role in the corruption trial of Zdravko Mamic.Mainly Modric has had to fight those reservations about his small frame in an evermore concussive game. Aged 21, he was rejected by Arsène Wenger (of course) and also Barcelona, where the sliding doors universe partnership with Iniesta and Xavi that never was is one of football’s many lost Edens.It was 10 years ago at Euro 2008 that Modric proved decisively to the world he had the craft and the tenacity to overcome any barrier. In Klagenfurt he was battered and kicked and bumped by Torsten Frings, Michael Ballack and Bastian Schweinsteiger, but bounced up to elude and bewitch and generally run rings around Germany’s midfield. It is perhaps the best model of what Modric might face at the Luzhniki Stadium on Sunday.France will be prepared. They have a huge depth of talent but also a real physicality. Modric will once again be hunted down, snapped at. Interrupting his flow will be key to a France victory. It is a challenge he has never shirked. And win or lose, he deserves every late-breaking accolade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c60c054a35c3bb8e3079c6f9b7d7b06f84b6384f/0_303_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a05d93d976f7fe92325bbf7e8ad47c69","title":"fa england gareth southgate world cup","story":"Ruling body has been trying to raise playing standards for more than 20 years and its overhaul finally bore fruit in RussiaOne of the early dates in the diary for the Football Association’s management team after their unexpectedly heartening World Cup campaign is with the parliamentary committee which has serially bashed England’s governing body over the years.The chairman, the Conservative MP Damian Collins, who led a vote of no confidence in the FA only last year – attended by just 17 MPs – has called them to account for the proposed sale of Wembley Stadium. But the mood in the room should be different this time from the habitual, ritual excoriation.The FA has been relentlessly, often justifiably, criticised for failing to govern the national game robustly and rein in the Premier League’s commercialised excesses.But the FA has a right to credit where it is due for England’s advances in Russia and the foundations, including Gareth Southgate’s own development, have been long in the planning and construction.The groundwork for the team’s assured progress to the semi-final was laid at the £105m national football centre at St George’s Park, concrete investment in English football from the billions of pounds washing through it.The shortcomings exposed by the semi-final defeat against Croatia show investment is still needed in participation and grass-roots facilities ruthlessly underfunded by Collins’s Conservative government, and for Premier League clubs to give more first-team opportunities to young English players.A senior FA executive told the Observer the World Cup experience has only reaffirmed its resolve to sell Wembley to the Fulham and Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team owner, Shahid Khan, and invest the proposed £600m proceeds in grass-roots facilities.“We desperately need to improve playing conditions nationwide,” he said. “We hope the England team’s progress, and recognition of the work which has gone into it, will give more confidence that the FA as an organisation can be trusted to handle the project properly.”The DFB’s overhaul of its structures after Germany’s failure in the 2000 European Championship – chronicled in Raphael Honigstein’s book Das Reboot – is justly lauded as an example to English football. But less well known is that the FA did undertake its own review, led by the then technical director Sir Trevor Brooking, after the 2010 World Cup.Southgate’s first role at the FA, as head of elite player development, working to foster better relations with top players and the clubs which release them, was itself a result of the review. Talking to the  in 2011 the England manager explained that a longer-term plan was being developed for England squads to perform more confidently than when he was a player. “We definitely realised we were inferior,” he said of his time as an international player.“Everybody realises we can’t keep playing the way we have and producing the English style of player. We have to grow and change.”The renewed FA effort to improve English footballers dates back at least 21 years, to the former technical director Howard Wilkinson’s Charter for Quality. It called for a total, professionalised improvement to clubs’ youth development. That has happened, although clubs’ modern Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) academy system has been criticised for recruiting thousands of boys at seven or eight who will never be given an opportunity to play first-team football at the elite level.Wilkinson accused Premier League clubs last year of failing in their “moral duty” to give opportunities to academy graduates and called for a review. He believes overall, though, that England’s performance illustrates the deeper progress made since the years he was insisting the FA needed a national football centre like France’s home at Clairefontaine.Wilkinson always believed the FA financing Wembley’s rebuilding was an unfortunate political accident and sucked up too much time and money, leading to St George’s Park’s construction being mothballed in the 2000s. Asked last week if he agrees with the plan to sell Wembley, Wilkinson gave a one-word answer: “Absolutely.”He explains the significance of St George’s Park, now a base for England’s 28 men’s, women’s and disability teams of all age groups, their coaches and support staff, and coach development programmes: “Our aim was to make it the Oxford and Cambridge of football education. It is symbolic: you can’t have a national development programme for players and coaching and not have a home.”Brooking, Wilkinson’s successor between 2003 and 2014 when Dan Ashworth took over, was dedicated to nurturing more confidence with a football, learning from Spain and Germany. His national football strategies introduced the small-sided children’s game and coaching that encouraged passing from the goalkeeper, through defenders and “the three thirds” of the pitch, a style which Southgate’s team endeavoured to play in Russia.“We tried to introduce it at the grass roots,” Brooking says, “then St George’s Park was the base we needed, where all the national teams would come, where coaches would work together, learning, speaking around the table.” After the centre finally officially opened in 2012 under Ashworth, Southgate as the under-21s coach and other FA performance staff further developed the common philosophy, style of play and preparation, publicly launching the England DNA policy in December 2014.The clear principles Southgate was expounding in Russia to sudden, dazzled admiration from a delirious nation were in fact well established. His mantra for players not to experience past England glories as a weight but strive instead to “create their own history” is a component of the DNA ethos which has been up on the FA’s website for years.They learned from British teams’ scientific approach to Olympic success, recruiting some of the staff who had been involved in it. The sports psychologists Lane4 worked on their first pilot scheme with Mark Sampson’s strongly improving women’s team in November 2014, and the value of psychology, headed since last November by Pippa Grange, became nationally recognised during the tournament.Yet the margins between glory and ignominy in World Cup football are, of course, minute: had Colombia scored their last two penalties in the shootout England would have been out at the last 16 again, and Southgate’s talk of DNA and writing your own history could have been ridiculed as management guff.But the FA is taking heart from current success across England teams last year the men’s U17s and U20s won their World Cups, the U19s the European championship,and the U21s and women’s senior team reached their European Championship semi-finals.Brooking agrees Premier League first teams must increase the number of English players, but also acknowledges that clubs’ major investment in the EPPP has improved academy coaching. He hopes England’s progress, and further improvements, will foster more opportunities.“It would be hugely frustrating to have the world’s best league and not be developing young English players,” Brooking said. “It has taken longer than we hoped, but this World Cup should not be a one-off.”At the national centre of politics this time, perhaps Damian Collins and his fellow MPs may even find themselves asking the FA for a little advice, about the merits of careful planning and attention to detail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443783c104e63d22378e5d167188ed15a259ad09/0_314_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64edf04c50ed602eced8a8d44af183a8","title":"footballers coming home no fanfare","story":"England’s World Cup campaign ended in anti-climax, but this was a team that inspired the nationEngland’s World Cup squad will arrive at Birmingham airport this afternoon to a notable lack of fanfare, despite their exploits in Russia uniting most of the nation behind them. Supporters have been warned to stay away from the airport as there is no official welcome-home party, or plans for an open-top bus parade.Some are planning to make the journey anyway, proving how much they have captured the public imagination over the past five weeks.Summing up the national mood, Gary Lineker made a tongue-in-cheek-apology to “non-English football fans” and tweeted: “Football’s coming home is a fun song highlighting the lack of success of our football team for decades. No one really thought we’d win it. I totally get why you might think it was arrogance, but it’s more our self-deprecatory sense of humour.”And so, in St Petersburg yesterday, England were soundly beaten by Belgium in the third-place playoff, losing 2-0 in a fixture famous for being the match no player wants to be involved in. Fans from Bradford, Cheshire, Stoke and Crawley, among others, had hung their flags on the side of the stands at the Krestovsky stadium as England made their last hurrah. But shortly after the final whistle they were folding them up again for the long journey home.It was a deflating end to what has been a rousing tournament for England until their defeat to Croatia in the semi-final. It is now tied with Italia 90 as England’s second-best finish at a World Cup and will also be remembered as a missed opportunity after they led Croatia for more than an hour.Around 1,000 England fans, including the omnipresent England band, were inside St Petersburg’s 64,500 capacity stadium. Before the start, the loudspeaker blared the Three Lions anthem and they were in full voice.An estimated 200 England fans have travelled to all seven games in six Russian cities, covering a distance of around 17,000 miles in the process – for some an expensive and complicated route involving dozens of planes, overnight trains and lengthy car journeys.Their hopes of watching England deliver their best World Cup finish since 1966 suffered an early blow as the side went behind after four minutes. Belgium defender Thomas Meunier erted a cross from Nacer Chadli past the lunging leg of Jordan Pickford, which had the goalkeeper punching the ground in frustration. Belgium dominated most of the first half, their passing far superior, and England required a few impressive tackles from defender John Stones to prevent them going further behind.But on 82 minutes the Chelsea forward Eden Hazard dealt the final blow after superb build-up work by Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne.England fans continued to applaud the players, many of whom looked physically and mentally drained. Fraud investigator Steven Crouch, 35, and his friend Kevin Heeley, 31, both from Birmingham, were reflecting on the positives. “We got caught up in World Cup fever,” Heeley said, “we have loved it. England really have performed way beyond expectations and they have re-connected with the fans.”Despite now being hotly in demand on the after-dinner circuit back home, where celebrity bookers have claimed he could secure as much as £100,00 per engagement, Gareth Southgate played down his influence on the young team. “People view it as a sign of weakness of the coach but I think it’s a huge strength if you’ve got a team of leaders that are prepared to make decisions and take control of things,” he told BBC 5 Live’s World Cup daily podcast. “It’s great to pass the leadership on sometimes because there’s only so much energy everyone has and if you’re the manager that has to drive every decision, it’s brilliant to have a captain taking responsibility.”Graciously accepting the defeat, Harry Kane praised his team. “I can’t fault the lads, we gave it everything,” he said. “We’ve closed the gap but today shows there’s still room for improvement. We’ve said that all along. We’re still learning, still improving.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d788a52ac64776f090938952c479b0bbefbf5663/0_79_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19d7ad75e8a4892ae5b48793f6ce4100","title":"france hopes world cup glory kylian mbappe","story":"The country’s new football hero has given pride and a positive image to the urban ghetto where he was raisedBeneath grey apartment buildings in the poor suburb of Bondy, north-east of Paris, there was a familiar sound of summer afternoons: the thud of a football against concrete as children played kickabout in potholed courtyards.But the French flags hanging from car windows, the banner supporting the French football team on a street corner, and children proudly wearing France football shirts showed a new sense of excitement. “Kylian Mbappé for president,” shouted a 10-year-old with a ball.It was here in Bondy that Mbappé, the 19-year-old French hero of the World Cup, was born, raised and played his first games.As France prepares to face Croatia in the final, the hero-worship of Mbappé has turned a positive spotlight on Paris’s poor banlieues. Several star players grew up in the capital’s outskirts, including N’Golo Kanté and Paul Pogba. The outpouring of pride is a welcome change for the ethnically erse areas which, more than a decade after the 2005 riots, are still so stigmatised and discriminated against that one politician warned this year of “a new apartheid”.French politics has traditionally placed extraordinary pressure on the national football team to be a standard bearer for the country’s identity and a magic fix for society’s ills. It is now seen as political folly to have expected Zinedine Zidane’s ethnically erse 1998 World Cup winning team – mythologised as “Black-Blanc-Beur” (Black-White-Arab) – to have solved France’s deep-seated identity problems 20 years ago simply by winning a tournament.Four years after the 1998 “rainbow” team was held up as a balm for race relations, the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen – who complained of too many black people in the French football squad – made it to the final round of the 2002 presidential election. In last year’s presidential election his daughter, Marine Le Pen, won more than 10 million votes, the best ever result for the Front National, now the Rassemblement National.But the fact that during this World Cup Mbappé has been hailed as a national hero of ersity is seen as a reflection of a changing France and growing banlieue talent, a move to bridge the ide between the capital and its hinterlands. Sylvine Thomassin, the mayor of Bondy, lauded the fact that the tournament has brought “a good image of the banlieue in general”.At a Bondy youth club, teenagers were preparing red, white and blue banners and stockpiling flags for the town’s screening of the final. “The World Cup has brought such a positive feeling here, it’s magic,” said Kamelia, 15, who played women’s football at AS Bondy, the small local club where Mbappé trained as a child. “There’s a real feeling of solidarity – whole families will be gathering to watch the match.”Ayoub, 16, another young local player, remembered Mbappé as a child. “He was always out there doing extra practice. He’s our mascot. He’s proof that, if you work hard enough, everything is possible.”In the town centre a vast banner hung from the roof of the town hall saying: “Thank you Kylian.”There has been such an increase in leading French football players from the Paris banlieue in the past two decades that the area around the French capital is now seen as perhaps the world’s biggest talent pool of budding footballers, ahead of São Paulo in Brazil. There are many reasons: excellent local clubs, a high concentration of a young population and the large numbers of talent scouts who flock here. Even the style of some of the players is said to reflect a childhood of street football where many learn to play fast in small spaces.Bondy, where Mbappé grew up, has a population of about 50,000, extending either side of a motorway linking Paris to Charles de Gaulle airport. It is part of the département of Seine-Saint-Denis which, with 1.6 million people, is the poorest area in France, with the youngest population. It was in Seine-Saint-Denis that three weeks of riots across French cities began in 2005, after two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré, who were on their way home from football, were electrocuted while hiding in an electricity substation after they were chased by police.Unemployment and poverty on the estates north of Paris is still higher than elsewhere in France, and many young people remain marginalised and jobless because of their address, skin colour or their parents’ immigrant roots. President Emmanuel Macron once described the discrimination and inequality here as a kind of “house arrest”.But Mbappé and his family tell another story of the banlieue – young talent, ambition and family support – which France has been keen to embrace this summer. If the young star began singing the national anthem and dreaming of playing for France before the age of five, much is due to his parents. His father Wilfried, who has Cameroonian roots, was a local football player and a respected coach in Bondy. His mother, Fayza, of Algerian origin, was a professional handball player. They still advise their son, who has been praised for giving his World Cup match fees to charity and he has said he would be lost without them.“Wilfried Mbappé was a coach and youth worker while I was growing up, he always gave everything for the community if it wasn’t for him, I might not be where I am today,” said Hakim Ziane, a teacher and youth worker. “It’s wonderful that the banlieue is being celebrated today rather than stigmatised. There are no barriers in this town. There is a lot of talent and we need to do what we can to make sure social mobility works.”Of the 23 players in the young French squad, more than half are of African or Arab descent, drawing comparisons with the 1998 squad. France’s place in the World Cup final is already being hailed as a kind of unifying balm. Two sociologists called the final a kind of “collective therapy” after years of terrorist attacks that have fractured an already riven French society.But in a French republic that is in theory supposed to be colour-blind, issues of race and identity in the national team have not been easy in the past decade.In 2010 the team’s mutiny at the World Cup in South Africa was privately blamed by some on black or Muslim players, including the French convert to Islam, Franck Ribéry. Speculation was that the team had fragmented over a lack of “national identity”, which angered supporters in the banlieues. In 2011 French football was mired in crisis after claims that officials tried to limit black and Arab players on youth training schemes to make the team more white. The novelist Olivier Guez, who flew with Macron to watch the semi-final in Russia, warned last week against burdening the team with too much symbolism about “the nation”.But in Bondy the positive mood is welcome. “Everyone is so proud and happy, it has been amazing,” said Shaïma Outouia, 21, a youth worker and sports coach who knew Mbappé. “It’s great to show Bondy in a positive light, as a place that does everything to help its young and old. On TV, Kylian rightly looks serious, but I know him as someone fun, generous, always making people laugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e82a4803b67f95b40a490708315794886f3726a/1103_249_2219_1331/master/2219.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f07b9d8eba38a71fcb0abb2e55b82fbf","title":"world cup 2018 17 things we learned","story":"Including: England’s mental shift, why everyone loves Neymar, and the height of Mel from Mel and SueBut it doesn’t improve it much, either.

One of the system’s suspect moments – Russia’s Ilya Kutepov being cleared of fouling Sergio Ramos in the box – earned meme status. Among the VAR verdicts: “It’s not fit for purpose” (Gary Neville) “It’s bullshit” (Nordin Amrabat) and “It’s extremely satisfying” (Fifa).Ronaldo v Messi never got going. Instead, Saturday 30 June was a watershed moment: both sent home early while Kylian Mbappé scored twice in four minutes. Mbappé says he’s not bothered by Ballon d’Or talk. “I couldn’t care less about that. I want the World Cup. I want to sleep with it.”In the end it didn’t take much to change England’s penalty psychosis: just a new mental approach based on inflatable unicorns, rubber chickens, trust exercises, Oscar Wilde quotes on the walls, “re-framing emotions” and some solid management speak. “We spoke a lot about owning the process,” Gareth Southgate said before the last 16. Colombia had no chance.Southgate started as coach-by-default: a beige, failed ex-Boro manager. He ended it touted as the English Macron, fit to lead a new centrist party of national unity. Tributes included his Atomic Kitten remix and lifestyle think-pieces with headlines such as: “Gareth Southgate Is The Manager We Wish We Had At Work”. He’s a style icon now, too.“They were talking about us, the English journalists, pundits from television,” Modric said after Croatia’s semi-final win. “We were reading all those words and we were saying: ‘OK, we’ll see who is tired’.” He finished the game having taken his total distance covered in six games to 63km, more than any player. “They should have been more humble,” he said. “They should have shown more respect.”Neymar’s rolls inspired all the best gifs. “I don’t care much for criticism,” he said before going home early. “It’s just an attempt to undermine me.” Also contributing to the entertainment: Luis Suárez, producing a rare double-bounce e against Egypt and Pepe, reacting to being patted on the shoulder against Morocco by doing what Pepe does.Julen Lopetegui said his eve-of-tournament sacking by Spain – prompted by Real Madrid announcing they’d hired him – was “the saddest day of my life since the death of my mother.” FA head Luis Rubiales said he’d had no choice: “There’s a way to behave, and this is not it.” It didn’t end well for Spain, but Real were happy enough: the sacking saved them a reported €2m contract buy-out fee.Both ITV curses delivered again: one major England defeat, and one advert mix-up – ads replacing the start of Russia v Saudi Arabia online. Other big moments included Sam Matterface describing Cristian Pavón as “the same height as Kirsten Dunst, or Mel from Mel and Sue”, and the expression on Lee Dixon’s face when Mark Pougatch asked him to analyse the summer’s geopolitical backdrop on day one: “Everyone is aware of what’s going on. But now it’s football’s time.”Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov spent his summer doing PR with a bewildered Mo Salah Vladimir Putin said playing host had “helped break many stereotypes about Russia. This is a friendly country.” Gianni Infantino was happy to help. “This World Cup is changing the perception of Russia, particularly from us in the West. Even the police are smiling! I feel like a child in a toy shop.”Always a big part of any tournament: Fifa taking the edge off its own “zero tolerance on discrimination” message. This year: fining Russia €8,500 for a neo-Nazi banner, Mexico €8,500 for homophobic chanting, Sweden €60,000 for “unauthorised sock branding”, and Croatia €60,000 for allowing players to consume non-official-sponsor beverages on camera.Among Diego Maradona’s best work as Fifa’s £10,000-a-match envoy: getting emotional on white wine and abusing fans making a “slant-eyed gesture” at South Koreans and criticising a referee as a “thief”. Diego’s view: “I send a kiss to everyone, thanks for the support!”Hyundai, Fifa’s official bus slogan sponsor, unveiled Germany’s bus branding in May when the mood was upbeat: “This slogan really captures the unity and cohesion of this German team.” It meant Germany had to travel back to the airport early in a team bus branded: “Zusammen. Geschichte schreibenLet’s write history together.”Back in week two, @Lord_Sugar was busy handling fallout from his tweet comparing Senegal’s players to “beach-sellers”. His efforts came in two phases: 1) Before taking PR advice – “It’s meant to be funny for god sake”, “I cant see what I have to apologise for you are OTT its a bloody joke” - and 2) After taking PR advice: “I deleted the tweet. I am very sorry.”It ends badly for them. Rabio the octopus was sold and eaten despite correctly tipping all Japan’s group games, Beijing cat White Spot was found dead after getting seven out of 10 matches right and Britain’s Marcus the pig called England’s quarter-final wrong and ended up being bullied off social media. One fan wrote: “What a f*****g liar Marcus the pig turned out to be, snake.”Ally McCoist had some “wonderful, wonderful breakfasts”. His best co-commentary: “Kazan has come a long way since it fell to Ivan the Terrible in 1552. It’s unbelievable, Jon. If you put me in a corner and nailed me, it’s probably my favourite place on the trip so far, Kazan. Just some stunning, stunning, architecture, Jon, I’ve got to tell you.”A 3-2 defeat in the 94th-minute of their last-16 game left Japan’s players in tears. They then went back to their changing room, showered and changed, tided up, removed the rubbish and left a note for ground staff reading “thank you” in Russian. The fans did the same to their stand.When their anthem was played in Nizhny Novgorod before their first ever World Cup game, Panama’s studio pundits cried and held each other. When Felipe Baloy then scored their first World Cup goal to make it 1-6 against England, their commentator went to pieces. “My country has scored!” he sobbed. “GOAAAAAAALLL for Panama! The first ever for my country!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/400b51e7164095eb1d131dc1f6e1b9d1672093f7/0_58_1713_1028/master/1713.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=054159d31b67c82b8bc6fdbbbda0a43e","title":"england finish fourth and a world cup final preview world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s 2-0 defeat to Belgium, tactics obsessives, inidual awards, ‘it’s coming home’, the World Cup legacy and a pre-season friendly which ended 22-0."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2133e1a2540e440d73d662f1fab027d4e5af9b1/0_0_2800_1867/master/2800.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7eee592ace6597ad9b936a56ca7df1f 700w","title":"world cup 2018 final buildup latest on france v croatia live","story":"World Cup winner and supreme header saver, Gordon Banks, has done some hailing of Jordan Pickford on the radio.I thought he played really well.

Not long until the big one now!Ben is too young to remember this song, so I will bring you some top notch rock.Do you know your France from your Croatia? OK, it’s a bit harder than that. And, with that, here’s Will Unwin to guide you through the final stages of all the buildup before the big one gets under way:A timely killer stat, via Opta: Croatia are the first team after Germany back in 2002 to reach a World Cup final after qualifying for the tournament by the play-offs. Zlatko Dalic’s side overcame Greece in two legs last year, ensuring progress to their fifth finals. And finally, on the 31st day, we will get to see it. Fourteen inches tall, weighing 11lb and made of 18-carat gold. For one group of players, the opportunity to hold it, caress it, feel it against their skin. For the team that loses, a lifetime of regret. Kylian Mbappé summed it up best when he was asked a few days ago about winning the Ballon d’Or. “I couldn’t care less about that,” he said. “I want the World Cup. I want to sleep with it.”Another email, this time courtesy of Tom Hopkins. “I ended up watching Wednesday’s game in a cafe in Paris (there for work ...) next to a lovely Croatian couple,” he begins. “Obviously not the result I was looking for but it was great to meet them and it gave me an excuse to reminisce about Igor Stimac and Aljosa Asanovic. So, for a couple of reasons I’m firmly Team Hrvastku today.” Sacha, also from the French capital, adds: “Haven’t Croatians beaten our reputation in France for being arrogant (see Lovren, Modric, their press ...) ? Aren’t we more likeable, for once?”A shed load more contenders for our unofficial Golden Ball shortlist, courtesy of James, via email. “Certainties: Modric, Hazard, De Bruyne, Mbappé. Likely: Griezmann, Kanté, Lloris, Mandzukic, Rakitic. Possibles: Coutinho, Kane, Pickford, Trippier, Ronaldo, Cheryshev, Pogba, Lukaku, Cavani.” Transfer nugget: first Eden Hazard, now Thibaut Courtois. The Belgium goalkeeper admits the £200,000-a-week contract offer on the table from Chelsea is not big enough for his liking, and has hinted he may follow Hazard out the door at Stamford Bridge. Any exit would pave the way for Chelsea to step up their interest in Roma’s Alisson. “Obviously with this World Cup, I think what was on the table obviously is different than what I can have, maybe,” he said. “In this World Cup, I have ignored all the speculation, all the rumours. But now in the next few days I will have a chat with my agent and see what Chelsea told him, and then we will talk. But I feel happy at Chelsea, it’s not that I necessarily want to leave.”Luka Modric has won the Champions League on four occasions – but he insists this is different gravy. “Without a doubt, winning the World Cup would be the greatest success of my career,” he says. “Even the fact that we’re playing in the final is greater than anything I’ve accomplished. I’ve had great things happen during my career but I did not believe this would ever happen, because it’s hard to predict your own story. Playing in the final for Croatia is something I will carry with me for my whole life. We will do everything we can, we’re proud to be here.”Sixteen years ago, Ronaldo’s hair-island won the World Cup:“Predictions? Il rentre à la maison,” offers William Hargreaves, after a quick dab of Google Translate. Smooth. “I have fancied France all along but it would not surprise me now that Croatia could win,” emails Steve. As for Thomas Krantz, he emails: “France to win with a header from Varane in the 23rd minute from a free-kick. The rest of the match a boring stalemate with Croatia lacking the creativity and intensity to break down France’s solid defensive screen. Probably lots of yellow cards as well, and a red for Perisic in the 76th min. I sincerely hope I’m very wrong about all this ...”“Difficult to see anything except a France win today,” says Lanzini, below the line. “Best team and super strong players everywhere. Croatia will rely massively on Perisic and Rebic – if they turn up they have a chance. While Modric makes the team tick these two are really the guys that creates superiority going forward with direct runs, speed, classic wing play, 1v1 duels.” Keep the predictions coming, via email, Twitter, etc.Warming up for kick-off? Here’s some essential listening:With a thumping 6-0 win for France rumoured below the line, it seems a sensible time to engage in pre-match predictions. Hit me:It’s coming home ... England have left the ForRestMix hotel in Repino for the final time. We’re just booting up Flightradar as we speak. Anyway, they’ll arrive back in Birmingham with a bump this afternoon, though presumably they can catch the big one on board their jet (will they plump for BBC or ITV?), in between the in-flight questionnaire and filing a few reviews on TripAdvisor. Unconfirmed reports Gareth Southgate is wearing a waistcoat. Things are looking up for Kieran Trippier, though: If Bacary Sagna bigging you up pre-match doesn’t help, then nothing will. The former France defender has been talking-up Paul Pogba’s brilliance, amid a sea of criticism last season at Manchester United. So far, so good for Pogba in Russia this summer, though. “Of course after being transferred to one of the best club in the world for £100m, people expect you to score every game,” Sagna says. “He plays a position which for me, is quite tricky. He is a genius with the ball, a very special player.”Say no more:With the big game on BBC and ITV, we really are spoilt for choice. But with all these awards soon upon us, who has been the pundit of the tournament? One of Jermaine Jenas, a consistent performer, Rio Ferdinand, surely a manager in-waiting, or Bilic, perhaps?With the final now just five hours away, it seems a good time to explore the path to Moscow, charted by snapper Evgeny Feldman:Over in Argentina, red-hot reports suggest that the soul-searching is well and truly over, and that Jorge Sampaoli is on the scrapheap, sacked following their last-16 exit to finalists France. An official announcement is supposedly imminent. And, don’t worry, I thought he’d already gone too.Plenty of money is being thrown around, particularly in the Premier League, on players with plenty of noise, and hype, around them (Seri, Anderson), albeit few who have starred in Russia. That’s still to come, of course. Chelsea are keen on Aleksandr Golovin, while Denis Cheryshev will surely have won admirers. So, the question that then begs is, who might yet get a whacking-big move on the back of a few good games this summer?Listen to Barney Ronay, or hear him out at least:Unofficial Golden Ball shortlist: Mbappé, Hazard, Modric, Griezmann, Kanté, Pogba. Events in Moscow a little later may well decide the winner. Any more for any more?Marta is torn, but might head rule heart come 4pm:Transfer nugget: West Ham United have confirmed the arrival of the Lazio midfielder Felipe Anderson for a club-record fee of around £33.5m, after a medical on Friday. He has signed a four-year deal and becomes the club’s seventh summer signing, following Fabian Balbuena’s arrival from Corinthians on Saturday. “West Ham is a club with a lot of tradition, lots of great players have played here, like Bobby Moore, Carlos Tevez and Di Canio,” he says. “I’m really happy to be here. It’s a dream come true.” Hmm, anyway, some good, and relatively promising early business from manager Manuel Pellegrini:Tired of talking about whether they’re tired, Zlatko Dalic insists there are no excuses for his Croatia side. After three rounds of extra-time, and two penalty shootouts, he has had to answer countless questions over his side’s fitness, batting away fears over freshness. “France are very dangerous on the counter-attack,” he says. “We had a tough journey to the final, but there are no excuses, we are ready for the last game of the tournament.” As for his last words to his squad at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow a little later, he’ll be keeping it simple. “I will say ‘have fun, guys’. I want my players to enjoy themselves. I am very proud of them.”Harry Maguire’s eyes are already on Euro 2020, with the semi-finals and final set for Wembley. “When the Euros come around the fans will be really excited again,” the England defender says.What sort of World Cup final do we have in store? Does it have the ingredients of a classic? Are we win for extra-time, and maybe even penalties? The last three finals have gone to extra-time, for what it’s worth, so we could be in for the long haul. France, clearly, are favourites but Croatia will relish that dark horses tag:Beer-throwing compilations at Boxpark? Check. Hundreds of pre-planned celebrations at Hyde Park? Check. If Croatia do it, cue the throbbing, thumping crowds in Zagreb and beyond:Fear not, once the World Cup is over, the Premier League will be back and, on this evidence, Everton are going to walk it:Some quick, and unspectacular, maths suggests France’s population is more than 16 times that of Croatia’s. Sure, it’s not got a David v Goliath ring to it but, by getting here, it’s a brilliant achievement. A penny for the thoughts of Nikola Kalinic, the one-time Blackburn striker who refused to play in their Group D opener against Nigeria, who must be feeling pretty stupid this morning:“I think it’s bad news for the English game”:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97f0fa1b0eaa4d52579a8e6ad4fbec140ab34119/0_0_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc98035813ab41e9b83a0963ae8458fd","title":"food with a view great places to eat outdoors","story":"From beachside shacks to a cowshed with an art gallery, five outdoor cafes and restaurants where the landscape is stunning – and the food is betterThe Hidden Hut lives up to its name, a small gem of a restaurant nestled along a National Trust footpath, near Portscatho and St Mawes on the Roseland Peninsula in southern Cornwall. A few benches outside offer views down to Porthcurnick beach and across the water.Run by the husband-and-wife team Simon Stallard and Jemma Glass, who is a third-generation Portscatho local, it’s a cafe during the day, serving freshly baked Cornish pasties, soups, cakes (made by Jemma’s mum, Maggie) and lunchtime specials, ranging from tagine to seafood chowder.In the evening, it’s transformed, with feast nights turning the hut into a culinary destination that attracts diners from far afield (Stallard published the first Hidden Hut cookbook earlier this year, too).“The feast nights are very outdoorsy and there’s not much polish – hopefully, the food is the champion,” says Stallard of the events that began with an impromptu barbecue intended to use up some fish. A casually placed chalkboard by the road and word of mouth led to bigger things, though each feast still focuses on just one dish, whether that’s freshly landed local mackerel, or the grilled bone-in sirloin steak from their own cattle. (There are always vegetarian options and some evenings, such as the south Indian vegetable thali event, inspired by Stallard’s travels, are meat-free.)Prices for the feast nights, which run from March to October, vary from £13 for the seafood paella to £25 for the most popular evening: lobster and chips.Stallard’s not being modest about the Hut’s informality, with 60 to 100 diners bringing their own cutlery, crockery and drinks. Seating is on communal benches or the camping chairs some bring tucked under their arms.Feasts go ahead in all weathers. Although a nice summer’s evening can boast dramatic sunsets and the chance to spot dolphins in the bay, it is the colder nights, when diners huddle up together, hot water bottles in their laps, tucking into a plate of hot food, that Stallard thinks are the most memorable.In 2017, more than 22,000 people applied for just 600 covers over their summer season. How has the ever-growing popularity changed this remote hut with its open-air feasts?“The hut is still the same size,” jokes Stallard. “Our focus hasn’t changed. It’s always been on the food.” ASThe Hidden Hut is out now (HarperCollins, £20) hiddenhutIt’s a world-class art gallery with a thousand-acre farm. It’s a famous garden and a serious restaurant, with its own Henry Moore lobster on the wall. The cooking at the Roth Bar \u0026amp Grill at Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, Somerset, is run out of converted cowsheds by Steve and Jules Horrell, with a bar by Björn and Oddur Roth, son and grandson of artist Dieter Roth: all scavenged woods and stuff, just like granddad’s work.More lists: there is a Himalayan salt room for ageing meat from animals born and bred on the farm. There are free-range mangalitsa pigs Angus, Hereford and wagyu-cross cows sheep gambol through fields before being turned into suckling-lamb chops or merguez sausages served North-African style, with harissa and beans. They even have a vineyard.It is so bucolic you could almost hate it, were it not (almost) integrated into the community. There is a village summer party, a pumpkin festival, a field has been given over to local allotments. Art is, of course, central. The galleries currently house an Alexander Calder retrospective, with a massive mobile and free-standing metalworks punctuating the outside space. There is the re-homed Serpentine Pavilion by Smiljan Radić, plonked at the end of the garden like a 1950s UFO (the design, btw, is by superstar plantsman Piet Oudolf, currently planning the outside space at the new Noma in Copenhagen).But, truthfully, the Horrells don’t need any of this to make the Roth Bar \u0026amp Grill work. Yes, happily, much of the produce comes from local farmers, gardens and gamekeepers, but it is the cooking you will come back for. Full of bold flavours and ideas, I would drive a long way for the food, with or without the arty accoutrements, though I like the setting, the room and much of the artworks on the walls. “Steve’s cooking is all about the theatre and my part is the table setting and styling,” says Jules.My current obsession is their Francis Mallmann-inspired metal cage and fire pit – they do “fire feasts” on Thursdays – with heavy iron kit, reminiscent of the Inquisition. “There is no better way to cook than lighting the fire for an asado just as dawn strikes,” says Steve. “All you can hear is bird song and the crackling of flames. Once we have the fire going and the lamb is on, we sit fireside and grill home-cured bacon and eggs from the farm. We never let the weather stop us – we have cooked for parties in rain and snow.” So, I will return for a Thursday evening (I have an eye on the fish stew fire feast on 9 August). Or maybe make an extravagant detour for lunch, if passing within 50 miles. AJrothbarandgrillRiver Exe Cafe is like very few other restaurants. Built on the reclaimed hulls of two defunct canal barges, it sits in the middle of the wide tidal estuary between Exmouth and Starcross. Customers must take the water taxi from Exmouth Marina. “You need to come with a sense of adventure,” says co-owner David Foa. “The cafe does move a bit when boats go past.”Foa and his business partner, Paul Craven, opened the cafe in 2011. Foa wanted a clubhouse for his wakeboard and water-ski school, while Craven wanted to open a cafe. Now, it has six people in the kitchen and up to eight front of house.Seafood is, unsurprisingly, a priority here. Foa says the big seafood platters are a bestseller – with crab, prawns, white-fish ceviche, scallops and clams at £60 – but you can also go for whole Brixham crab, or mussels served six ways. “We buy off the local fish supplier in Exmouth,” says Foa. “He goes to Brixham market every morning, so it’s straight to plate.”Fish delivery isn’t the only thing that has to be negotiated daily. Everything that comes to the cafe – “every bottle top, every tissue” – has to go back. “Our poo boat, called Winnie the Pooh, does a run every day.” With no pipes or power lines, water has to be shipped over and electricity is from a generator.To complicate matters further, the seasonality of the cafe (it closes from the end of September until April) makes “finding the right people, and holding on to them, very difficult,” says Foa. So what makes it all worthwhile? He laughs. “Just getting to the end of the season feels like an achievement.” He relents a little. “Having happy customers in is nice, too. We seem to be doing OK.” KFriverexecafeThere are restaurants on boats, swung from cranes, in car parks and deconsecrated churches, so we shouldn’t really have a problem with a great restaurant on a caravan site in North Wales, should we? Marram Grass is exactly that, a comfortably sized former shed that brothers Ellis and Liam Barrie have taken over on their parents’ holiday park in Anglesey.When they began in 2011, chef Ellis was knocking out fry-ups, while Liam, who trained as a surveyor, was front of house, wrangling the holiday-makers. I know. In a world where every new launch seems to come from two chaps who quit their City jobs to ride their “dining concept” to financial triumph, a couple of blokes knocking out bacon baps to caravanning families sounds fantastic, doesn’t it?But here’s the thing. They got it right. Very right. They decided early on that they’d stick with local suppliers and continue to accommodate local customers and, when I made the trek to review them, I found they were turning out incredibly high-quality dishes (Marram made the Good Food Guide in 2015). I remember kingly fresh mussels from the Menai Strait, spectacular local plaice in caper butter, and a mad “deconstructed cream tea” for dessert. It was disorientating. Such quality and skill, yet with a cheery informality and, Christ, such huge portions. They’ve kept it up, too, working on the menu, winning awards, finding new suppliers and developing old ones, and announcing a very “non-caravan-site” guesthouse. What success can’t alter, though, is the integrity of the food, the endearing room and the lovely crew.As Ellis explains: “The Marram Grass ties so much into the location because it has evolved as a business alongside us, tucked away on Anglesey. Farmers that we talked to as customers became suppliers. The kids of our customers were the people asking for work experience and jobs – the beginnings of a team.”Michelin may never visit a shed but you certainly should. Marram Grass is one of a kind: a big-hearted combination of a spectacular local caff with splashes of fine-dining refinement and enough witty MasterChef touches to please the crowds it now attracts from all over the country. Not a day goes by when Adam Riley doesn’t wonder what he’s doing, serving seafood from a converted shipping container on a Tyneside beach. But then the winds drop, the crowds come and it all makes sense. “The advantage of a business like this is you get to do what you want,” Riley says. “We’re not part of a high street, so we can be flamboyant and different.”Riley’s Fish Shack, garlanded with fairy lights, smoke spiralling from its chimney, is certainly that. Riley trained as a chef on the Isle of Man, but went into theatre when he moved to Tynemouth. The shack started life as a mobile barbecue for the Tynemouth food festival in 2012, built out of bicycle parts he had left over from a street art project in Derby. As to the choice of the beach, a serious stagger down the steep path from the road above: “I always wanted to open somewhere that was quiet, so you could create your own atmosphere, and this has long been my favourite beach. It has a calm, tranquil feel.”The barbecue cart was replaced by the container with its wood-fired oven. Soon there were queues, aided by ecstatic reviews, not least from this newspaper. “I like to exceed expectations. People think they’re coming for a bit of mackerel and then they get a lot more.” Indeed they do: there’s wood-fired lobsters and empanadas stuffed full of long-stewed beef and oysters, all of it served in wooden boxes. You perch on rickety stools at a rough wooden bar, looking out to the North Sea, and all is good.It’s not always easy, not least because Riley insists on staying open all year round. “During the beast from the east, the winds kept blowing bits off,” he says. “But we only lost three days to the snow.” He’s regularly asked to open more shacks, but he’s not convinced. “I’m responsible for sourcing all the fish as ethically as possible and, if we had another shack, we’d need another me.” He may open a wet fish shop with a cafe. “I think the chefs would like the chance to use real plates.” But he’s not planning an empire. He has his shack on the beach with a view of the sea, and that’s all he’s ever really wanted.

Of course, I remember it from the other side, those gloriously boring deserts of time that stretched from July to infinity and took in almost 4,000 screaming rows and a number of own-brand Calippos.In the early days of my now desiccated memory there are trips to Cornwall and long car journeys listening to Uncle Johnny’s Party Tape TM with its tight edit of Motown and Leonard Cohen (“Why do we have to listen to rabbi music?” I once whined), and there are also whole days down at the brook, banking our 5ps for a bottle of Tango. Then in later years, a slow promenade around Brent Cross, our local, well, now I suppose we’d call it a mall with no embarrassment? It was the first place we were allowed to go without adults, and we relished these hours gliding over its mezzanines of brutalist capitalism, these tuna sandwiches eaten like grown-ups, dangling our legs in the indoor fountain.Scrolling online through photos of the polished interior from the 80s and 90s, with its bemused wooden animals standing guard outside John Lewis, was so overwhelmingly nostalgic that I had to sit down for a moment. I’m not alone – on Vimeo, over footage shot when ascending the escalator in 1992, someone’s composed a soundtrack “attempting to recreate from memory the sound of Brent Cross shopping-centre”, woozy organs against the rush of that fountain. That was the sound of the summer holidays, but no more. Nope.The reality of a month and a half without school or nursery, when half of our potentially child-caring family members are away yet full-time work selfishly insists on continuing as normal, well, it’s been quite a surprise. This is the bit that you must bear with, because I know, even as I type it, that these are the brand of conversations you will actively spin away from at parties, the kind used later to illustrate how boring your friends have become. But it has thrown me, this problem suddenly appearing in my lap like a bat flapping through a window during breakfast – it is shocking, and stupid, and inevitably, because of my stained personality, I can draw a direct line from this to the subjugation of women.Because it seems to me to be another sharp nail in the coffin of women’s careers. I know that it is not always women who carry the weight of flexibility and organising care – #notallwomen etc – but having frantically asked everyone with young children I’ve encountered over the past fortnight, it has without exception been the mother who has sighingly explained how they sort out the swimming camps, the drop-offs, the timetabling of holidays, the calling in of favours from neighbours and friends. Unless they don’t have a job – which itself is usually an unchoice made around the time they gave birth (and, call me cynical, seemingly a totally sane reaction to the impossibility of having it all) – then it is their career that suffers, picked away at by the beak of necessity. And their relationship, too – if they’re in a couple, the family will never holiday together, as the parents will each use their allocated days to be with the children, while enacting a complicated dance around the wall-calendar with their colleagues.The standard holiday entitlement is 5.6 weeks – the school summer holidays alone are six weeks long. Even in term time, school finishes at about 3.30pm work, as a rule, finishes at 5pm. I was in the bottom group of maths, but even I can see something doesn’t add up here.We’re bringing up children in a pound-shop system – there are missing pieces, what’s there is made of bad plastic that breaks on impact, and where the engine should be there’s a box of bees. Working doesn’t work. Nannies, au-pairs, pssh, even if my generation of parents had the money we certainly do not have the spare bedrooms. Does this sound ranty? Petty? To me, new to all this and very bad at admin, it feels like a symptom of something, another thing, very broken. And apart from grand and decisive action from above, like a proper restructuring of the ways we work, or making childcare more affordable, I really can’t see a solution.For the foreseeable future, the sound of the summer holidays for me will no longer be that dreamlike buzz of an air-conditioned shopping centre, instead the screaming of an online diary reminder against a low-level hum of anxiety, spiked with operatic moments of rage. I’ve looked behind the curtain of the summer holiday myth, and found an awful lot of dust.I haven’t identified so strongly with anything as I recently did with the bin lorry that became stuck in Berkshire as roads across the country melted in the heatwave. I am that bin lorry, its wheels sunk into the oozing black, emanating a stench made worse by the sun, unglamorous and overcome by heat.As the NHS turned 70, people shared their stories online of the many times it had saved their lives. And the effect, for me, was a grim sort of awakening, seeing how many people I know had been suffering in so many varied, frightening ways. Through it all, knowing they could rely on our underpaid, overworked, beautiful NHS.A man found two plastic bags left behind in a loft, and, as he documented on Twitter, they contained a trove of historic LGBTQI+ pin badges. He took the collection to Gay’s The Word bookshop in London, where they’ll be displayed.

Bookmakers and online casino companies enjoyed one and a half times as much screen time as alcohol firms and almost four times that of fast food outlets.A government review of gambling regulation published earlier this year shied away from suggesting curbs on gambling adverts, citing insufficient evidence that adverts for betting were causing harm to children and vulnerable people.But Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, and the charity GambleAware said this was partly due to a lack of funding for research into gambling adverts since they were deregulated in 2007, under Tony Blair’s government.“One of the only downsides to this brilliant World Cup has been the bombardment of gambling advertising on TV and social media that thousands of children will have been exposed to,” said Watson. “With an estimated 25,000 children under 16 addicted to gambling, there is nowhere near enough work being done to study the effects of this advertising. “Instead of confronting this issue in the most recent gambling review, the government has turned a blind eye. In doing so they’ve let our children down.”Watson added that Labour would impose a mandatory levy on the industry to fund increased research, education and treatment of gambling addiction and the effects of advertising.It has only recently commissioned the first major piece of research, conducted by the University of Stirling and Ipsos Mori, into the effects of gambling ads being deregulated more than ten years ago. The studies are not due to be complete until next year.GambleAware chief executive, Marc Etches, said: “In the absence of evidence, the concern is that this is an adult activity and young people are growing up with it being normalised.Fiona Dobbie, who is leading the University of Stirling’s research into gambling ads, said the study would analyse the response of children and other vulnerable groups to marketing.“This is very much a starting point and we hope it will make a positive contribution to future legislation and policy to protect children from gambling-related harm,” she said.According to ITV, nearly 30 million people watched England’s semi-final clash with Croatia. This increased the cost of gambling advertising on the channel because it allowed companies to reach so many people.Advertising industry sources said a 30-second spot during the semi-final of the World Cup could cost as much as £350,000 but that bookmakers and online casinos were paying a premium to secure blanket coverage. analysed more than 1,300 adverts that have been shown around the 30 games carried by ITV in the competition to date. Of those, 172 were betting adverts or one in eight commercials. Excluding the sponsored adverts shown at the beginning and end of each break, betting accounted for one in six adverts shown during the broadcaster’s World Cup coverage.The Advertising Standards Authority said it had received 115 complaints about World Cup gambling adverts, mostly about their sheer volume, compared to just 27 in the previous month.The regulator is also examining several adverts that offer improved odds for a short period, to see if they contravene new guidance in the advertising code of practice that bars companies from making urgent calls to action.In the UK, gambling companies are only permitted before the 9pm watershed if they do so during live sporting events.The stipulation is in stark contrast to the law in Australia, where gambling adverts attached to live sports were banned earlier this year.Methodology:  recorded the duration of every advertisement shown during ITV’s World Cup coverage, specifically, the ad break prior to and after the national anthems, the two half-time ad breaks and that directly after the game ending. Where the match went to extra time andor penalties the analysis was extended to include the ad break shown directly after the match was decided.The adverts were grouped into the following categories: betting, motoring, grooming, mobile phonenetwork, alcohol, technology, online shopping, broadband, fast food, TV adverts, financial, supermarket, DIY, foodsoft drink, computer, pharmacy, insurance comparison website, entertainment, travel, furniturehousehold, social media, insurance, fashion, Defence Forces, estate agents, health, other.

From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business.

Mine included. I grew up in Bolton in the 1980s, at a time when no one wanted to say anything positive about gay people. If we were represented in the media, it was as disease-carrying sexual predators who couldn’t be trusted around children. The idea of gay role models didn’t even exist. And then along came Madonna.I first became aware of her around the time Like a Virgin was released in 1984, and felt myself being drawn in, but I resisted. I’d been conditioned to be mistrustful of transgressive, rebellious women who expressed their sexuality. By the time the True Blue album came out in 1986 – I was 11 – I was starting to realise I was gay. And that made me sexually transgressive too.Then came the Open Your Heart video. In it, Madonna played a stripper dancing in a venue for an audience that included a lesbian drag king and two gay sailors locked in an affectionate embrace. The thing about her that had been my point of contention suddenly became a point of connection. After that, I didn’t just enjoy Madonna’s work: she became like a spirit guide.People forget the role Madonna played in opening up gay culture to the mainstream. She wasn’t gay herself, but from the beginning she talked about how gay people were part of her life: her gay mentor, her dance teacher, Christopher Flynn the artists and photographers she hung around with like Keith Haring and Herb Ritts the gay dancers she paraded around so proudly in the film In Bed With Madonna. You cannot imagine what it was like to witness her doing that when you were being mercilessly bullied about your sexuality at school, as I was. This was when George Michael, Freddie Mercury and the Pet Shop Boys didn’t dare to come out.Nowadays, online, it’s easy to know that there are other people like you in the world. But in the 1980s, you existed in your own bubble. This was also the time of Aids emerging. The album Like a Prayer came with a copy of a handwritten note from Madonna – I remember so clearly opening it, and how tenderly it was worded, declaring that everyone with Aids deserved respect and compassion, “regardless of their sexual orientation”. Madonna was accused in TV interviews at the time of being irresponsible because of her support for gay culture – you can still see clips of this on YouTube. But she ripped into homophobic interviewers with such ferocity, like a lioness protecting her cubs. It had an incredible impact on me.Before Madonna, it felt like all gay icons had been tragic figures. And yes, Madonna had endured great tragedy in her life – her mother died when she was five – but you never saw an ounce of fragility in her. Think of her in that Jean Paul Gaultier basque – it was like a suit of armour. She was all steely defiance and I wanted to channel this to get through the challenges life was throwing at me.I started to write a novel about growing up gay back in 2006, but it didn’t start working as an idea until I added Madonna. I travelled to Argentina, working as a producer on The South Bank Show. I was recognising so many locations from Evita and couldn’t get the film’s soundtrack out of my head. It dawned on me that Madonna had been with me all my life. There’s a lot that’s different to my own life in my novel, but a chapter about the protagonist, Charlie, going to see Madonna in her first ever UK concert in Leeds in 1987 is one of the most autobiographical. I remember watching in awe as my idol performed a show that was all about self-respect and standing up for your self. I was blown awayWhen people think about 1980s pop icons, they often think of those who’ve gone: Prince, Whitney, Michael Jackson. They often forget about Madonna, the only one that’s survived – and they continue to mock her, not just for being a sexually confident woman but for one who’s dared to get older and continue to produce work.But I love how Madonna’s never wanted to be seen as a nostalgia artist and how in recent years she’s become even more politically outspoken. Her speech at the Billboard women in music awards in 2016 she called out the “blatant sexism and misogyny and constant bullying and relentless abuse” she’d experienced as a woman in the music industry. So many people have relied on Madonna’s music for emotional support in their lives and I’m so glad she’s still here, still expressing herself, absolutely on her own terms. Because if she hadn’t been doing that when I was younger, I’m not sure I’d be here now – and I certainly wouldn’t be the person I am today.The Madonna of Bolton by Matt Cain\u0026nbspis out now (Unbound £14.99).

I wish to apologise to my constituency association and to the people of Burton I am honoured to represent.”He said he would be seeking professional help to address his unaceptable behaviour sending sex texts. “I do not seek to excuse my behaviour and will be seeking professional help to ensure it never happens again.“In time I hope to earn the forgiveness of all those who put their trust in me and that I have let down so terribly. The prime minister and the government she leads will continue to have my full support.”The Sunday Mirror has reported the content of the messages, which it described as “depraved”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48fb34b622b672f3d6da828b6182954c4344e3a5/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81a3fa17cad8fe674bc2613befbc475e","title":"stratford brexit balance leave remain","story":"Two years on from the referendum, we find out if people in Stratford-upon-Avon would now vote differentlyOn the sun-drenched streets of Stratford-upon-Avon, Andy Martin, a Remainer from the farming community, says he doesn’t discuss Brexit with most of his friends, though he is surprised how many farmers voted out.“They all had the false sense that someone was telling them what to do. But there will always be someone telling them what to do. That’s life,” he said last week.The ision between Martin and his friends perfectly encapsulates isions in the Warwickshire town two years ago when the EU referendum took place. Stratford voted 52:48 for Brexit, exactly representing the national ide. It’s also a town recently identified by Sussex University as particularly vulnerable to Brexit because, like many neighbouring towns in the west Midlands, it is heavily reliant on the motor industry for jobs. So, after more than two years of painfully slow negotiations leading to last week’s white paper, has the delicate balance between Leavers and Remainers started to tip the other way?Around the corner in the Edinburgh Woollen Mill, shop assistants Ian and Dave stand by their decision to vote Leave. “I don’t think Brexit will do any harm,” says Dave. But he also says he doesn’t really follow the politics or where discussions have got to. “My faith is strong,” he explains.Jonathan Baker, the chair of Stratford4Europe, a local pressure group, says that very often where people stand on the issue is indeed a matter of faith rather than judgment. “We’ve often likened it to religion. People hold on to their beliefs regardless of facts or evidence. It’s a kind of emotional thing. What we find is that people who are hardened Brexiters and Remainers will always be hardened Brexiters and Remainers, regardless of what happens.”Stratford4Europe supported one of few public efforts to bring both sides together. Brexit Cafe is a coffee-morning forum that’s been held twice at the Townhouse Cafe for Remainers and Leavers to air their views and bridge the ide “one cup at a time”. It was the brainchild of Manuela Perteghella and Sophie Clausen, two residents who felt on 24 June 2016 they had woken up in a foreign country, one where they were unwelcome. Clausen is a Dane from, of all places, Elsinore, Hamlet’s home, who decided to face her fears and try to understand what Leavers think. Most often they don’t want her or her family to leave – they just don’t want other Europeans, who they don’t know, to come. “They say, ‘It’s not people like you. You’re OK to stay.’ They think they can pick and choose.”But plenty of Europeans feel uncertain about the future. In recent years, hotels and restaurants in the town have been overwhelmingly staffed by Europeans. Now speak to people in the industry, and they say that they’re struggling to attract staff.“We used to get six CVs a week, the vast majority from Europeans. Now it’s six in total for the year, and only two of those from Europeans,” says Fleur Gougoulia, who runs the El Greco restaurant. She says this is a problem for the local economy because, as Stratford has low unemployment but high rents, it struggles to attract workers from elsewhere in England. In any case, she says, Britons remain reluctant to work in the hospitality industry.I put this point to one local, highly vocal, advocate for Brexit, Digby Jones, the former director general of the CBI, minister for trade and investment in Gordon Brown’s Labour government, and now in the House of Lords. He says it’s the same problem in the care industry. “The government should have announced on day one that anyone working here is welcome. Your job is safe. I would have shamed Brussels – or Berlin, because Berlin runs Europe – into offering the same provisions for Brits in the EU.”He says the white paper does not give full control over our borders, leaves us still under the will of Brussels and tied to the European Court of Justice. “This is not really leaving the EU.” Yet later, when I ask if he would prefer the position laid out in the white paper to remaining in the EU, he says: “Yes, because contrary to what a lot of people think – and I was on the inside of this as trade minister – Britain never had a lot of influence in Europe. We’ve kidded ourselves.”No doubt there’s some fine distinction there between importance and influence, but one can understand the confusion that a lot of people feel who are not wedded to either camp. There’s an element – to borrow a certain writer’s phrase – of a plague on both their houses.There is also reluctance of many local businesses to express an opinion. No one at the Royal Shakespeare Company, where Lord Jones is a member of the Artists Circle, would talk to me, even though I was told they are overwhelmingly Remainers.“They’re so reliant on corporate sponsorship,” said one reporter at the Stratford Herald, the local paper that’s been actively keeping the debate alive. Whenever the Herald runs a Brexit piece on its website, readers “go crazy”, says reporter Chris Smith. “A Brexit story raises the same kind of interest as a Shakespeare conspiracy story.”And stories don’t get any bigger than that in Stratford.Yet manufacturers – who in Stratford had been loud in support of Brexit before the referendum – found their senior executives were all busy while I was in town. One managing director who did speak, anonymously, said the public were angry and confused by the idea of a soft Brexit.When I asked if they still felt the same way, he said there was a large turnover of staff and he couldn’t speak for them. “We now have a number of EU nationals here,” he acknowledged, “and I think it fair to say they wouldn’t vote for Brexit.”The picture that emerges from Stratford is full of ironies and positively Shakespearean in its complexity. Perhaps the most telling quote came from Martyn Davies, a beamingly youthful-looking 63-year-old refuse collector, who I met as I left town. I asked him what he thought locals thought about Brexit. “They’re clueless really,” he said, emptying a bin. “No one really knows anything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bd422723f8861cd42f5f8c25493071bd080df7a/0_177_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ecb77f9e2dde31c9c5995402953ca19","title":"venkatraman ramakrishnan interview brexit science funding innovation collaboration royal society","story":"The Nobel prize-winning biologist and president of the Royal Society on how Brexit might affect the sciencesBrexit hasn’t happened yet but how is the process affecting science?There are two answers to this. One is that we’ve heard anecdotal evidence that people are leaving or not wanting to come here. But we don’t have any statistical evidence of a brain drain. I would add that it has had a negative impact on the mood. For a long time people outside Britain saw this attractive, outward-facing country – a great place to work. That reputation has been hurt.How many countries could somebody come to relatively late in life and be elected president of their national academy? That shows the kind of Britain we want to get across. I’m hopeful that when all the dust settles, it will continue to be an attractive destination.Airbus CEO Tom Enders said recently: “Brexit in any form, soft or hard, light or clean, will be damaging”: would you agree with him on that? Science by its nature has always been an international enterprise and in fact the more prestigious and high performing the lab or institute, the more international it is. It’s very hard for the science community to see any advantages in Brexit. They are pretty blunt about that.There’s an irony in that post-Brexit we will be dependent on science to come up with innovations that could grow the economy at time when we’re taking funding away and making it more difficult for researchers to come here and collaborate… There is, but the knowledge-based economy that’s needed in Britain will have to exist whether we’re in the EU or not. In the long term we will not be able to compete on labour costs and raw materials. Even things like manufacturing are being automated. So they’re not going to be the source of employment as much as they would have been in the past. There’s no getting away from that. The thing about Brexit is that we have to absolutely make sure that whatever happens we do not jeopardise the ability to attract the best talent from all over the world.Yet it’s been a long-standing goal to keep net migration down to 100,000… My view is that that number was always unrealistic. I think people need to be honest with the population and say that in a nimble and innovative economy, you have to be flexible about these numbers.Speaking as someone of Indian origin who was awarded the Nobel prize for work conducted here – and you’ve been knighted – did you find the rhetoric around immigration during and after the vote disheartening? I was certainly not happy about it. One reason I was happy to be awarded the knighthood was because I thought it sent a good message, a positive message for immigration.What does that fact that 19 different European cities bid to replace London as the home of the European Medicines Agency tell you? It shows how important it was and what a blow it is to lose it. Considering that we have a very large pharmaceutical industry in the UK, the UK was a natural home for the European Medicines Agency, and I think it is a big loss.At the moment we’re a net gainer from EU science funding. Presumably this will end. Are you confident the UK government will make up the shortfall?The onus is on the government to make sure science doesn’t have a net loss of funding. My understanding is that if there is a good agreement on science between the EU and the UK, we would continue to participate as an associate member – on a pay-as-you-go basis.But it’s not just the funding. In the aftermath of two world wars, there was a decline of European science compared to the United States. In the 1960s and 70s, the US was the natural destination for young scientists, but in the last 40 years, Europe has come together in a concerted way and made Europe a global powerhouse. So I think it’s important for us to preserve that cohesion.Things don’t seem to be going well so far: we lost the European Medicines Agency we’ve been booted off the Galileo project and we’re no longer part of Euratom… The EMA I would put in a slightly different category. If we’re going to leave the EU, there’s no reason for one of their agencies to be here. But I do believe that it’s in the interests of both parties for the UK to continue to participate in the other two. I do worry that the broader political debate is somehow influencing what is good for science.It feels like Galileo has become a test case for other issues. It’s almost like we’ve decided to go for a no-deal Galileo project – that we can go it alone without the EU’s help. I’m not an expert on what to make of the rhetoric. We just have to do our best to continue to collaborate. I have no idea what the alternative would be.Will Brexit open up any new opportunities for UK science? Are there burdensome EU regulations you’ll be glad to see go? Will collaboration with scientists in non-EU countries, like the US or China, become easier? Will tranches of non-EU funding become accessible? The only thing I can say is that if you have new technologies and you need to make regulations where current regulations don’t exist, then it’s easier for a single country. Britain is very rational about balancing risks and benefits. Its easier for one country to move fast. This is a sort of theoretical, possibly marginal benefit. Whereas the actual risks and drawbacks of Brexit are much more real and immediate.Do this week’s resignations make you feel more optimistic or uncertain? As a Royal Society president, I have no expertise in politics. I’ll tell you as just another punter on a bus. My view is the isions in the government to some extent reflected the isions within the country. Government cannot be ided it has to make up its mind to do something. And so in that sense, a more unified government will actually help us move forward.When you took this job, did you imagine you would be having to defend science in this way? When I joined the Royal Society I never imagined the referendum would go this way. But most scientists and academics, including myself, and most of the readers of your newspaper, live in a bubble. I remember after the referendum all my colleagues said: I can’t believe this happened. I don’t know anyone who voted for Brexit. These people never bother to talk to the plumbers, the electricians and the cleaners in their own building. But I knew lots of people who voted for Brexit. I wasn’t as surprised as my colleagues.The clock is ticking…I think we’re going through a particularly fraught moment right now. Negotiations are coming to a head and so on. I very much hope that science gets a really good deal out of the negotiations because I honestly believe that it’s in the best interests of Europe as a whole. We can help European science continue to move forward because there are big problems in the world. There’s a food problem, an energy problem, the emergence of disease, what artificial intelligence is going to do to the economy and to jobs. And these problems are best tackled by coming together. So that is my hope.

Some have been asked to pay increases that are higher than the total council tax bill for homeowners in the same area.“I’m being priced out,” said Rachel Brown, 36, a freelance film-maker who lives at a CRT residential mooring in Islington, north London.“I’m a low-income single mum. This situation is causing instability in my child’s life as we will be forced to change school if we have to move.”The fees for boaters in Brown’s permanent mooring are set to increase from a yearly figure of just over £9,000 to £12,521 in three years. When asked to explain the increase, she says, the trust said it had to operate within the boundaries of competition law (not all moorings are managed by the CRT, with some being privately leased).The price increase could damage long-established boaters’ communities all around London, claim those opposing the rise.“I’ve been living on my narrowboat for 14 years. My mooring used to have a vibrant community,” said Joseph Caldwell, 47.“Now more and more people are being forced to abandon their homes and neighbours, and the place is turning into a leisure pied-à-terre for rich people that is half empty all the time.” Caldwell is being asked to pay £12,000 a year in mooring fees for his berth in central London.In comparison, the council tax paid by the owners of the flats that overlook his boat is between £1,271 and £2,382, depending on the property.It is estimated that more than 15,000 people live on boats across the UK. This alternative housing solution has become extremely popular in the past decade, especially in London, where property prices have been escalating since the 2000s.For many young people and first-time buyers, living on a boat in a residential mooring has been the only way to get on to the property ladder and own their own place in the capital. “I moved on the boat when I was pregnant. It was the only way I could afford living in London, close to my family and friends,” said Brown.“Being a freelancer, this situation is costing me much more than £12,000 a year. I’m losing income because I’m dedicating my time to challenging this unfair price raise instead of working.”In June, the CRT released a mooring strategy for London to deal with the increasing number of boats on canals and rivers. This number has almost doubled in the past eight years.“We’ve made proposals to increase our mooring prices in central London so that they reflect the market rate,” said a Canal \u0026amp River Trust spokesperson. “We’re still in the consultation phase and working with boating groups, including to look at options that help people who might struggle to afford the market price.“The current popularity of London’s canals is unprecedented. More and more people are choosing to live on water, and we are trying to find the right balance between residential, leisure and casual moorings so that everyone can enjoy the waterways.“As a charity, we also have to raise the money that is required to maintain the canals. We need to ensure that we\u0026nbspcharge a fair market rate for the services we offer, including moorings,\u0026nbspso we can invest in looking after the network.”Some of the boaters concerned are now preparing to challenge the increased fees. They are especially critical of the way that prices are determined by the CRT, accusing it of over-reliance on figures drawn from auctions – the usual way of securing a mooring – in the setting of yearly fees.“They assume a winning bid is the ‘market price’,” a member of the London Mooring Action Group said.“This is wrong. The winning bid doesn’t mean this is what someone is prepared to pay year after year, until they push the fees up more because someone else bids a higher price.”Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a242ea8e11cafe5ea32a427a1ac96ea1ca84680b/183_235_3278_1968/master/3278.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a763c3407471a3a2a20c667f35a2a3fe","title":"england india second one day international match report","story":"As anticipated the spinners prevailed. But contrary to expectation it was the English spinners, rather than Kuldeep Yadav, who ensured victory on another sun-kissed afternoon. Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali – or should that be Merlyn Ali, given that he took the vital wicket of Virat Kohli – stifled India’s middle order so that England won comfortably by 86 runs. So we have another decider on our hands at Headingley on Tuesday.The pursuit of 323 in this era does not intimidate batsmen but Eoin Morgan had read the situation shrewdly. He has in the past regaled us with his side’s love of chasing targets but he is also familiar with Lord’s and he reckoned that the wicket, which had a tinge of green at the start despite being dry, would become more difficult for batsmen needing to score quickly. This proved to be the case. Morgan batted first and Joe Root’s 12th ODI hundred ensured a competitive target. But Morgan still required the bowling and out-cricket to be smart. And it was.England may not have been flawless out there – a couple of sharp chances went to ground – but there were many highlights. Twenty overs from Moeen and Rashid yielded three wickets and just 80 runs, with the wrist-spinner’s googly proving especially productive. Jos Buttler behind the stumps took a superlative catch in his left hand via an inside edge from KL Rahul’s bat while the seamers, sensing a bit of help, were more disciplined than at Trent Bridge, with Liam Plunkett gaining the bulk of the spoils.India lost three wickets in the space of three overs to slump from 49 without loss to 60 for three with Rohit Sharma slogging and Shikhar Dhawan slicing before the departure of Rahul. This left Kohli and Suresh Raina with a rebuilding exercise they managed 80 in 16 overs whereupon Kohli, stuck on the crease, was lbw to a mysterious straight ball from Moeen. When Rashid bowled Raina the equation became unmanageable even for MS Dhoni who was all too easily shackled. By the end Dhoni was batting in the manner of Sunil Gavaskar in a World Cup match against England at the Oval in 1975 – seeking practice rather than victory.With the bat England delivered one of their more pragmatic performances mainly because Root scored most of the runs. He was run out for 113 from the last ball of the innings, which took his average in this format to exactly 50, hardly the figures of a man in crisis. Nonetheless these were timely runs. He is England’s best batsman but he has not been dominant this summer.After reaching three figures there was relief rather than defiance upon Root’s face. This was not a Nasser Hussain moment – remember how in 2002 Hussain, whose place at number three in the ODI side had been hotly debated, turned his back to the press box and pointed to the number “three” on the back of his shirt upon registering his hundred.Root has not been subjected to the same level of criticism as Hussain after his little trough. So there were no histrionics but there was a nasty little parallel: when Hussain hit 115 out of England’s 326 for eight 16 years ago, India managed to knock off the runs with three balls to spare. Back then this was an unexpected turn of events. In 2018 there was the suspicion, misplaced as it transpired, that England’s 322 for seven might not be enough.The pattern of England’s innings was familiar. Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow cruised past the fifty mark without much trouble. Then Kuldeep was introduced for the 11th over of the innings and Bairstow got out. It was a scrappy dismissal he tried to sweep Kuldeep’s second delivery and the ball ricocheted from his front pad to his glove and then into the stumps.Four overs later Roy’s slog sweep terminated in the hands of deep mid-wicket and England seemed to be succumbing, lemming-like, to the mystery spinner again. In fact, Root and Morgan dealt with him well enough thereafter during a 103‑run partnership until a rank full toss was swatted by Morgan into the old leg‑trap – another catch just inside the boundary at deep mid-wicket.Neither Ben Stokes nor Buttler could contribute. This is not much of a concern in the case of Buttler, but the old Stokes magic is proving elusive on the evidence of his brief innings at Lord’s and his long vigil at Trent Bridge. So Morgan was grateful for Root’s polished, extravagance-free innings. Root demonstrated why he is indispensable to this side. At his best he can glean runs with the minimum of risk. Down the order David Willey managed some of these while hitting a career best 50 from just 31 balls in a reassuring 83‑run partnership in the final nine overs of the innings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/894381bbd02646c3f8595e82a7c29f68ed333586/0_107_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fef88af46886105f97dbc2a5e712ba97","title":"tour de france 2018 stage nine on the road and cobbles to roubaix live","story":"“What’s up with Cav?” wonders Andrew Benton. “He seems to have lost his edge this year, just a few wins short of the record.” I’m not sure of the precise reasons, but he’s 33 now and so much has to come together to win sprint stages. He certainly had problems with the leadout yesterday after Dimension-Data had got themselves in a good position. He’s made it look a lot easier than it really is for many years.Dylan Groenewegen, winner of the last two stages, is involved in a crash on the way out of the third cobbled stretch. He’s limping, but finally gets a new bike and sets about trying to catch up with the group.“So gutted for Richie, he’s had no luck at all! Hoping it’s not too serious,” say Sarah and Nathan. The latest news on Porte is that he’s gone to hospital for an examination. He seemed to hurt his shoulder, or possibly his collarbone, in that early crash.Antwan Tolhoek is back in the peloton after that puncture. Still nine riders out in the lead, 3min 40sec clear.Thomas de Gendt took an intermediate sprint that seemed pointless until the insatiable Peter Sagan jostled through the pack to take 11th place, and five extra green jersey points. Peak Sagan.The last time a Tour de France stage had this many miles of cobbles was in 1983, when Belgium’s Rudy Matthijs won at Roubaix. That was five weeks before I was born.The breakaway pass the 100km-to-go mark, still 3min 30sec clear of the peloton, who are currently being squeezed mercilessly along the second stretch of cobbles. Bardet is being helped back to the bunch by a couple of his AG2R lieutenants.This could be an interesting day for the two men at the top of the general classification – Greg van Avermaet and Geraint Thomas. Both are entirely capable of winning this stage and getting a firmer grip on the yellow jersey. Could that change their teams’ tactics for the rest of the race? Van Avermaet’s team leader Porte is out, but his backup, Tejay van Garderen, is a strong GC contender on paper.Romain Bardet picks up a puncture on the first stretch! Because the cobbles come thick and fast over the final 100km, it’ll be difficult to get back into contention. He may be fortunate that it happened early, with some larger gaps between the pavé coming up.Ten becomes nine in the breakaway – Lotto-Jumbo’s Antwan Tolhoek has a puncture! The rest safely exit the first 1600m stretch, as the chasing pack start jostling for space back on the main road...Here we go! The breakaway tackle the first section of cobbles, which have apparently been swept to minimise dust and gravel. These prima donna modern-day cyclists, eh?The breakaway is passing through Cambrai, the first of 15 stretches of pavé now just a couple of kilometres away.Porte has had a rotten run of luck at the Tour, save for a fifth-place finish with Sky in 2015. He suffered pneumonia in 2014, was hamstrung by mechanical failure in 2016, and last year he suffered a horror crash that prompted debate about rider safety:Here’s our report on Richie Porte abandoning the Tour:Dan Martin, who said his late crash yesterday was like “being clawed by lions”, is patched up but struggling at the back of the pack. Adam Yates is also near the back – not sure why at this stage. The breakaway is now 3min 40sec clear – Van Keirsbulck and Claeys have given up their chase.Here’s a clip of Porte realising his Tour is over. Very sad to see.Steve Horne writes from the roadside: “It is scorching on the pavé today with a less than zero chance of rain so no prospect of Froome sliding out. Just a matter of getting tyre pressures just right, so the rims kiss the cobbles – and then going hell for leather.”Here’s that 10-man breakaway in full:“I am feeling very sorry for Porte, he doesn’t seem to have much luck at all,” says David Alderton. “I think many had high hopes for him this year. Crashes have made the top of the GC interesting – Thomas on the podium would be fantastic. I’d have thought Bardet would be higher up the rankings, but he seems to have been fairly quiet. Speaking of quiet, wasn’t De Gendt in every break last year? He seems not to have been so far.”He is today – in a 10-man group around 2min 30sec ahead of the peloton. Guillaume van Keirsbulck and Dimitri Claeys are in a second group behind them, but they appear destined to be caught before we reach the cobbles.Porte, who was forced out on stage nine last year too, was caught up in a big collision in the bunch. That also affected André Greipel, who’s been receiving treatment. Movistar’s José Joaquin Rojas was involved in the crash, and has also abandoned. Tom Dumoulin, short on luck in this Tour so far, suffered a puncture but is back in the main group.Some big early news – we’re only 10km into the stage, but Richie Porte is out of the Tour after a crash.This year’s Tour has been a slow burner so far, but that’s about to change. After a couple of serene, occasionally soporific flat stages, today we hit the Hell of the North. Today’s stage includes 15 stretches of bone-shaking cobbles, 12 of which feature in the infamous Paris-Roubaix one-day race.There’s a memorable stage win up for grabs, but for many, it’s all about survival. Race leader Greg van Avermaet won the classic last year, but others like Dan Martin, injured in a nasty crash yesterday, and Chris Froome, whose Tour ended around these parts in 2014, will just hope to get through it.And while we wait to get going properly, some reading for you:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0d75ce6734d6328d0fae350669ebd3b1ea7253f/0_1268_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78d099dc1c1d6f81676dee281692cb9e","title":"raising the barre how science is saving ballet dancers","story":"Could new science and high-tech training protect dancers from the injuries that end so many of their careers far too early?At the Royal Opera House in London, home of the Royal Ballet, art is fusing with science to revolutionise the way dancers prepare. In the glass-panelled healthcare suite, ballerinas are standing on high-tech force platforms which analyse their leg power, and gripping barbells fitted with linear encoders to track their lifting velocity. This is how modern dancers fortify their joints and boost the dazzling height of their grands jetés. With their hair in buns and pink pointe shoes poking out of their gym bags, the ballerinas shift weights with such power that staff have installed padding to spare the nerves of the costume department below.Principal dancers Marianela Nuñez and Alexander Campbell glide past. More arrive in white tutus, fresh from rehearsals for Swan Lake a graceful, giggling wave of youthful energy, chatting about barbecues and Instagram. Some complete bespoke cardio drills, calibrated using oxygen-uptake tests, to get fit for quick-tempo allegro routines. Others strengthen their soleus calf muscles, which on-site electromyography (EMG) analysis suggests can help stabilise their ankles. Every workout is uploaded to Smartabase, a data-analysis platform also used by the US military. Meanwhile, fatigued dancers apply Game Ready leg wraps, which harness Nasa space-suit technology to deliver tissue-repairing cold therapy, and learn how adding omega-3-rich anchovies to their salads can reduce muscle inflammation.The Royal Ballet is rich in tradition, but the company’s 97 dancers are now supported by a 17-strong team of sports science and healthcare experts. “Our facilities are now similar to those of a Premier League football club,” explains Gregory Retter, clinical director of ballet healthcare. “Strength, jumping, force attenuation, cardiovascular fitness, psychological wellbeing and nutrition all support the dancer to be free to create artistic excellence. This is a completely new concept in dance.”Many of the Royal Ballet’s innovations are inspired by a wave of game-changing new research overseen by the National Institute of Dance Medicine and Science (NIDMS). Launched in 2012, this collaboration of UK dance institutions and universities examines everything from dancers’ ankle mechanics to performance anxiety. Professor Emma Redding, head of dance science at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music \u0026amp Dance in south-east London, is a founding partner of NIDMS. “Dance has always been based on tradition and anecdote, but we started using words like ‘measure’ and ‘evaluate’, which are frowned upon in the arts world,” explains Redding, a former dancer. “People thought science might dilute the art. But we started asking, can’t we get dancers’ bodies and minds even stronger? Or even extend their capacities?”Trinity Laban’s Dance Science lab features wireless EMG equipment and face masks that can measure dancers’ muscle activity and oxygen uptake an Optojump system, which uses infrared LED lights to analyse jumps and a Tekscan pressure sensor, which gauges postural sway during pliés and pirouettes. This is where many ballet innovations are tested. “We have worked with choreographers like Wayne McGregor, but if you are paying to watch a professional ballet, you don’t want to see people with masks on,” smiles Redding. However, her findings are disseminated through journals and conferences to companies such as the Royal Ballet, which joined NIDMS last year. Her research has shown how eyes-closed training can boost a dancer’s proprioception – a kind of “sixth sense” which helps them understand the relative position of their limbs on darkened stages.To achieve this, Retter’s team combines external insights from NIDMS with in-house research. Strength coach Adam Mattiussi opens his laptop to show me a series of charts. “We are starting to quantify ballet,” he explains. “What are the dancers’ physical requirements? How many jumps will they do? What are their rest intervals?” As well as force platforms, EMG units, oxygen-uptake masks and heart-rate monitors, extra tools are accessible through their partnership with St Mary’s University, London, including a Vicon motion capture system used in Hollywood special effects studios. Data is allied to “difficulty scores” for each role, provided by the artistic staff.The mission is to build a digital bible of the Royal Ballet’s entire repertoire, enabling dancers to tailor their physical training for upcoming roles. The data has already yielded surprises. In The Nutcracker, Clara must complete 196 jumps, while Hans-Peter executes 18 lifts. Some male dancers land with 6,000N of force – the equivalent of eight times their body weight. These stats are now transforming the way dancers prepare. “The biggest change is the strength training,” explains Royal Ballet sports scientist Gregor Rosenkranz, pointing out the barbells, kettlebells and heavy sandbags. “It helps dancers attenuate those landing forces and avoid muscle injuries. But squats also influence jump height and balance, which helps create buy-in from the dancers.” A study by NIDMS confirmed that a year of conditioning can slash the injuries suffered by female dancers from 4.14 per 1,000 hours of dancing to 1.71.Retter had to “convince and cajole” dancers when the suite first opened in 2013. “Dancers see themselves as artists whose job is to perform complex choreography and convey emotion to the audience and I am trying to gently say, actually, you are athletic artists,” he explains. “If we make dancers jump higher and land more softly, they should perform better aesthetically, too.” One study published by NIDMS confirmed that strength, aerobic and power training can increase dancers’ aesthetic performances by developing better timing and rhythmical accuracy.First soloist Claire Calvert’s knee surgery in 2013 was her catalyst for experimentation. “A year off can send you into a black hole, but I thought about how I wanted to come back even better,” she says. “Suddenly, if I wanted to spend eight hours in the gym, I could.” At the peak of her rehab her squat one-rep max was 100kg. “It is my claim to fame,” she chuckles. That gives her a higher strength to weight ratio than 6ft 7in, 111kg England rugby star Courtney Lawes, whose one-rep max is 180kg.“Ballet’s old-school regime didn’t cater for the type of dancers we have become,” she explains, citing the relentless programme and high scrutiny. “Now we have higher demands of physicality, a more erse repertoire, so many shows, and little recovery time. On stage, I now have the strength and confidence to keep pushing through and perform steps better. When productions return every few years I realise they feel easier.”First artist Gemma Pitchley-Gale once deadlifted 97.5kg. “I was shocked when the staff said, ‘You know it is not normal to lift more than double your bodyweight.’ But the squats and deadlifts have alleviated my back and hip pain and I find jumps much easier.” During workouts between shows, the dancers lift lower weights but the maximal figures reveal their huge physical capacity: most can lift 2.5 times their bodyweight using just their calf muscles.Dancers are artists, not gymnasts, and value emotional storytelling over raw athleticism, but science is supporting their aesthetic endeavours in surprising ways. Tests have shown how dancers can soften their landings by ironing out muscle imbalances. EMG analysis has even suggested technical improvements. “By priming their leg muscles in the ‘flight phase’, dancers can attenuate landing forces using tendons and muscles, instead of relying on bone and cartilage, which causes stress and injury,” says Rosenkranz. Fitness tests also revealed that dancers’ heart rates never got as high during rehearsals as in front of audiences, when adrenaline kicks in. “If you only dance, without extra fitness sessions, you can’t perform at your best,” insists Rosenkranz. Dancers now bolster their fitness with bespoke cardio drills on rowers and stationary bikes. “I am no longer afraid of running out of breath,” says Campbell.Finding the time is not so easy. “We have to be respectful of rehearsal because this is where the real artistic excellence is created,” says Retter. His team uses strategic planning to avoid interfering with the sacrosanct work of the choreographers and artistic staff. “We map dancers’ workloads and do tests throughout the year to identify how best to use our limited time,” says Mattiussi. “We might say: let’s use that six-week gap before The Nutcracker for some big training, then back off during the shows.”The relentless schedule also plays havoc with the work of dietitian Jacqueline Birtwisle. “For dancers, it’s a constant battle between quality, bulk, availability and speed of digestion,” she says, shaking her head in mock-horror at the challenges. “And, of course, aesthetics are important. They work in front of a mirror all day and in front of an audience at night.”Ballerinas have long been vulnerable to the “female athlete triad” of anorexia, amenorrhoea and osteoporosis – interrelated conditions caused by insufficient calorie intake – but Birtwisle says this is normally the result of “unintentional underfuelling”, and improved awareness is reducing the threat. Retter has noticed a cultural shift: “When I arrived, the nutritionist was seen as the person you visited if you had a disordered eating issue. Now she is the person dancers ask about how best to fuel their day.”Professional ballet is riddled with pressures and anxieties, which is why occupational psychologist Britt Tajet-Foxell likens her work to The Princess and the Pea. “A psychological issue may be hidden under a hundred mattresses but it’s my job to find it,” she says. “I tell dancers, you get goblins in your mind that chew and get fat, but you can have warfare with them when you know how.”Injured dancers learn to create a mental video reel of positive associations – memories of good performances, safe places, or positive colours like red or yellow – to break negative reinforcement loops and boost self-esteem. “The subconscious says, ‘I will miss that role in Swan Lake, people think I am unreliable.’ Those dysfunctional thoughts wear you down. I collect those shattered fragments of confidence and create a positive framework to tap into.” Nervous performers learn to change focus, like switching camera lenses: “You must focus on the here and now, not ‘I hope I don’t wobble on that pirouette.’ Consequence-land is not a good place to be.” Tajet-Foxell also rewires signs of perfectionism – a trait linked to disordered eating and anxiety. “A perfectionist’s mindset is: ‘I must do it perfectly.’ That’s not possible. But if you say: ‘I am pursuing excellence,’ you always have somewhere to go.”Other wellbeing services range from expert tuition in the pilates studio to massage therapy in the recovery suite. Science is making its mark here, too, with those Nasa-inspired leg wraps, as well as Recovery Boots, which use sequential pneumatic pressure to squeeze out metabolic waste after exercise. An advanced system of pulleys known as a Gyrotonic station helps develop flexibility through fluid, dance-specific movements. Thanks to this mix of expertise and innovation, performance time lost to injuries has fallen over the past four years. And skilled ballet rehab coaches are getting dancers back on stage quicker than ever. “One dancer is jumping in the gym four weeks post-op, whereas 10 years ago he would still be on the sofa,” says Calvert.Performance science is even quietly shaping how some dancers manage their bodies on stage. Pitchley-Gale now combines her intuitive ballet mind, honed over decades of disciplined training, with detailed anatomical thinking. “The lower-leg footwork in Swan Lake makes you fatigue rapidly but – thanks to the squats and deadlifts – when I am jumping I now use my more dominant glutes and hamstrings higher up the chain to alleviate the strain on my lower-leg muscles, so my feet last longer,” she says. During pointe work, she consciously activates her core to optimise her posture and reduce the pressure on her foot bones. This example of aesthetic instinct underpinned by intelligent athleticism is, in many ways, the ultimate expression of Retter’s project: “Gemma is an amazing dancer who absolutely gets that this is all about freeing her to produce a brilliant artistic performance.”Days later, I watch a performance of Swan Lake, attended by 2,256 spectators at the Royal Opera House and beamed to 1,084 cinemas in 29 countries worldwide. Memories of EMG graphs and pneumatic boots dissolve from my mind as the dancers enchant the audience with their ethereal talent, every gesture electrified with raw emotion, every limb flowing like shimmering silk. Science may be silently ushering ballet into the future, but dancers’ centuries-old talent for conjuring movements of impossible beauty with such effortless grace will forever remain ballet’s grand, unquantifiable mystery – and its greatest gift."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/791b3168839f987f06d61590a9c89e1237a3d8fe/0_111_2288_1373/master/2288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f6e4bc8e7f639bd8b57fa2bba184e68","title":"the muppets take the o2 review kylie minogue","story":"O2 Arena, LondonThe anarchic comedy crew’s first ever UK date offers warmth, wit and mischief in an irresistible cavalcade of songs, skits and incongruous celebsThe Muppets long since conquered TV and the movies, and there’s been talk of a stage musical since Disney bought the franchise more than a decade ago.

Sometimes, it does. There are several non-sequitur sketches – such as the skulls and ghouls singing “The Boo Danube” – whose absence few would regret. But they add to the show’s bricolage character. Nothing hangs around too long the show never drags.And there are plenty of skits to savour, including bespoke routines, such as the one about Gonzo’s relationship with a jailer from the Tower of London, or Rowlf the Dog’s Maybe It’s Because I’m a Londoner singalong. The Pigs in Space are visited by David Tennant’s Doctor Who, before one of them regenerates as a Time Lord (“More like a Time Lard,” quips Miss Piggy), and starts mimicking Jodie Whittaker. The first-act highlight, though, is seeing Charles Dance’s pompous Wordsworth recital upstaged by a puppet prawn hosting a Balearic rave.How well suited any of this is to the O2 Arena is moot. Frequently, the framing of the action on playback screens overhead serves the material better than the wide, open stage. (A West End theatre – smaller scale, proscenium arch, music hall tradition – would have suited immeasurably better.) Keep your eyes on the live performance, though, and there’s the novelty of witnessing the Muppets’ puppetmasters in action, trundling on trolleys just beyond the spotlight, giving voice to Fozzie as he labours to crack a joke, and actions to the Swedish chef as, cooking a haggis, he force feeds oatmeal to a sheep.The chef also stars in a droll zombie spoof, The Walking Bread – one of many sketches that play out entirely on screen. If that feels like a cheat, at least those sketches are often funny, notably when they feature Statler and Waldorf carping from the box seats. The show’s spirit is best distilled in those oldsters’ blunt irreverence, although you glimpse it, too, in the commissioning of Kylie Minogue, no less, to sing the Mah Na Mah Na nonsense song, to the surprise of her two fish-mouthed backing singers.That said, tonight’s show is just as successful when it parks the backchat and pins its heart to its sleeve, filling the stage with choral singers for a Bohemian Rhapsody refit, or jerking tears when Kermit and co gather round his swamp to sing Rainbow Connection. Kylie joins in, and Doctor Who, too, part of the gang now, as powerless as the rest of us to resist the Muppets’ seductive combination of warmth, wit and mischief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cad81c97df2098d2c9025a209858fc7aa0897566/0_16_1094_656/master/1094.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d0f35fce09cd8bfdba4aa097bba2513","title":"instagram question answer new feature mistakes","story":"People thought they could make unkind comments with recourse before discovering users could see who was asking whatInstagram’s constant kamikaze launch of new features, in which they desperately try to hold on to their sizeable but fickle user-base by throwing new story modes and face filters at them, installed an interesting new question and answer function this week.The feature is similar to sites like Ask.fm and the now-defunct Formspring, where users could ask anonymous questions of each other, with the answers made public. Some people used these sites to secretly tell someone they had a crush on them, or ask something they’d be too frightened to say in public, but they also became hotbeds of high school bullying and were blamed for a spate of suicides.The big difference with Instagram’s version of the feature, is that the questions aren’t anonymous, you can see which of your followers asked it – although this isn’t made explicit. In fact Instagram confuses users by telling them that if their question is shared, their username won’t be displayed.It’s true that if the person you’re sending a question to decides to share your question publicly, your username is removed. However, what is not made clear is that the recipient is still able to see your username.This has led to quite a few people mistakenly believing that they are asking questions anonymously. Twitter was awash with disaster stories from people who thought they could get away with incognito behaviour:Fortunately for users worried about falling into a similar trap, the question feature is customisable. So while most people are using it for the default “Ask me a question” at the moment, in the future it could be used for less dangerous requests like “Where’s a good place to go for a beer in Chicago?”, “Can anyone recommend a plumber?” or “Does anyone know how to delete Instagram after I accidentally told all my friends their babies were ugly?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915ec80a36c373b2ea69973c7a0640478554ad1b/0_673_4667_2800/master/4667.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20776dd7e1cfdbb0c72be7a3d8f3ff24","title":"danielle brooks orange is the new black","story":"Actor Danielle Brooks is ready to conquer the world – and she’s taking no prisoners Last week Danielle Brooks’s father, a church deacon in the small town in South Carolina where Brooks was raised, called his daughter in New York. “He said, ‘Danielle, you won’t believe what just happened. I get out of the car and see this couple walking their dog, and they just stop in front of the house. He calls over and says, ‘Excuse me sir, are you Taystee’s father?’” The unexpected visitors were fans of Orange Is the New Black, and particularly Brooks’s character, one of its few truly likable inmates. “That’s crazy,” whistles Brooks, a little unsure of whether to be impressed or alarmed.I’m due to meet Brooks in a Chinese tearoom in midtown Manhattan in the middle of a sweltering summer day. I arrive half an hour early to cool down, but Brooks is already there, all in black, tucked away in the corner, as low-key as Tasha “Taystee” Jefferson is forthright. When she gets going, Brooks, 28, is a hoot. She has a deep, throaty giggle so contagious it should come with a health warning, though she’s as quick to well up, too, when she talks about the crippling self-doubt that followed her Broadway debut in The Color Purple. It’s easy to see why OITNB cast her as the emotional heart of the show. She’s passionate and warm if you had to choose a cellmate, she’d be high on the list.But there isn’t much in the way of light for Taystee on the horizon right now. “You see her really dealing with this stuff,” agrees Brooks. “For a long time, she’s someone who hides behind her pain, being the sunshine in the rain…” She dissolves into giggles, then goes at it again. “That’s so cheesy! So cheesy. Now she’s... she’s in the storm. She’s in a tornado. Earthquakes, the whole nine yards. We’re getting to see her go through it.”For all of Taystee’s misfortunes, Brooks’s career is on the up and up. A question about what she’s up to next takes around 15 minutes to answer. She’s in a mysterious new Chris Morris film she can’t say a word about (“He is the most private director I’ve ever met. I’m not even gonna do it to him, I’m gonna let y’all wait for it.”) She’s got three other movies coming up: one she doesn’t want to jinx by talking about it, one about gun control, another about death row, both featuring a lot of crying, plus an animated series in which she plays a grumpy grandmother – she’s just been doing the voiceover for it. In 2016, while shooting OITNB, Brooks was also starring in The Color Purple on Broadway. The schedule sounds punishing she says she slept when she could, often in cars between the two jobs. When she found herself staring up at an 18ft billboard of herself in Times Square advertising the run she was about to star in, it was a discombobulating experience. “I was looking at it and I saw these two women from Texas, who didn’t know me from Adam. I was like, ‘That’s me! That’s meeeeee!’” She claps. They all took a picture together.The performance won her a Tony nomination. “I would sing a song called Hell No every night, and got to say hell no to any fears or anxiety that I had, or feeling that I wasn’t capable, or that people would think I was a fraud, or just a TV actress. All those things that kind of creep in your head, I was able to say, ‘Fuck that!’” She politely mutes the vowel, but the worries became so loud that she ended up getting counselling to deal with them. “I always wanted to be a Broadway girl. But once I got Tony-nominated, it really messed with me, because it was like, yes I’m getting this affirmation that you’re right where you’re supposed to be, but there was still this voice saying, ‘You’re not good enough.’”Brooks admits that she’s often tough on herself. As well as acting she has modelled for Lane Bryant and designed a clothing line for Universal Standard she often tweets with the hashtag #voiceofthecurves. “I want to design clothes that I wish I could have worn when I was a teenager. And giving that to the next generation of girls. That’s why I do it.” This sense of purpose, of looking beyond herself, defines her life. “I want to be in everything, but that’s because I haven’t seen someone who looks like me in everything. I want to play a superhero. I want to be the love interest. I want to write my own stuff and create my own projects. I want to be in French films.”She can’t speak French – yet. “But I can learn it! I just want to be fully challenged as an artist, so that anyone who looks like me, who relates to me, says ‘Oh, if Danielle did it, I can.’ That’s what it’s about for me.” Previously she looked for role models like Viola Davis and Rutina Wesley. “Seeing them made me think, ‘I can do that,’” she says. “I am glad I got those examples, but now I can focus on being that example.” She credits church with getting her into performing. “It’s a good training. You learn how to talk in front of people, sing in front of people. They’ll give you encouragement,” she laughs, leaning back in her chair and clapping. “But they’ll also let you know if it ain’t going too good.”When she was 15 she went to a residential arts high school 20 minutes from her home town, where she could take theatre classes. The experience was life-changing. “I would always challenge things at church. And they didn’t like it,” she chuckles. “It wasn’t that I was rebellious, I was just curious about the why of it. So getting to come into this other world was eye-opening. I had a classmate who had a nanny. That. Blew. My. Mind. You had somebody other than your mother to feed you? What?”She applied to Juilliard, one of the most prestigious drama schools in the world, because she knew that some girls at her school had gone there. “I was like, ‘I don’t know what this Juilliard is, but the black girls are getting in…’” At her final audition, she remembers everyone else sitting on the floor, introducing themselves. “My turn? I stood my ass up.” She gets up from the table, switches into the performance. “I said, ‘My name is Danielle Brooks, I’m 17, from South Carolina.’ Everybody was like, ‘Yeahhhh’,” she says, mock-cheering. “They were really chilled. I made the most out of that one day, and I got in.”OITNB came along a year after Brooks left Juilliard. As Taystee, she was a counterpart to Piper, showing what prison looks like for the vast majority of inmates who aren’t rich and white. “Like, I know you like to see Alex and Piper make out,” she says. “But the important thing is prison reform and immigration, and civil rights issues. That’s really what the show is about, and I think Taystee brings people back to that. We ain’t got no make-up on, we got all the same outfits on...” She starts to say she watched Ocean’s 8 recently, with a naughty chuckle. She stops herself, then continues. “Fuck it, I can just say it. First of all, yes, I’m here for all these women working. But the fact that the first minute, Sandra Bullock’s got all this make-up on and she’s in prison? Her hair’s got waves in it! I was like, ‘What the heck is this?’”Recently Brooks was part of a video ad called A Great Day in Hollywood, which gathered 47 black stars working on Netflix, from Ava DuVernay to Spike Lee, Lena Waithe to Laverne Cox. “Being part of that was incredible. But there still needs to be more! Because if we were to do the white version, it would be…” she laughs. “It would be a bigger picture.”She’s been thinking lately about why people watch so much reality TV. “Especially black people. Real Housewives of Atlanta, Love \u0026amp Hip-Hop, those shows. And it’s because we’re thirsty. We are so thirsty to see ourselves.” A Great Day in Hollywood was released with the caption: “This is not a moment. This is a movement”, and Brooks says that’s important. “There’s no one way to be black. There’s no one way to be white. There’s no one way to be skinny, there’s no one way to be gay. If we show how complex we are as people, we can really help change the world with art. And I believe that.”Brooks believes it because she has seen it. “The fact that I have such conservative parents – when I first was on Orange, it was hard for my mom to watch that show. To now, her being in rooms with Laverne Cox and Lea DeLaria and loving the hell out of them.” She gets more emphatic, more high-pitched, a minister’s daughter through and through. “And people who preach every day that homosexuality is a sin – they watch my show! So I feel like it’s so important because I think it will help us understand each other better. To understand that we’re all the same.”Orange Is the New Black season six is on Netflix from 27 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddeb04e2f2fcf4666287365ff9909b40bd8b31c1/64_217_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b50fb0a82c5ef67d6a4dae696be23bb","title":"wakaliwood inside ugandas action movie studio","story":"When the trailer for Who Killed Captain Alex? went viral on YouTube, film-maker Isaac Nabwana’s mobile phone starting ringing with calls from around the world. One inidual went further. After seeing 40 seconds of the promo for Uganda’s first action movie, American Alan Hofmanis gave up his life in Manhattan to move to Wakaliga, Kampala, to help Nabwana, aka IGG, develop Ramon film studio – and Wakaliwood was born.The Ramon Film Studio, has produced more than 40 movies. Who Killed Captain Alex was produced in 2010 for just $200, while 2016’s Operation Kakongoliro! The Ugandan Expendables cost $2,000, the studio’s biggest production budget to date. To attract more viewers and break new ground, Nabwana wanted a female lead for Who Killed Captain Alex?Dozens of people work on Nabwana’s films, taking on all roles both in front and behind the camera: acting, doing stunts, designing props and costumes, technician duties and stage management. From the machinery to accessories and costumes, everything is homemade. Many of the actors live in the rehearsal rooms where costumes are kept.With little hope of pay for the moment, Wakaliwood members have side jobs. In a country where film piracy is common, Wakaliwood movies are mainly sold door-to-door and as quickly as possible, before pirated copies make it on to the market.That a film studio is able to flourish in a place where cinema has little history may surprise some. Yet, Wakaliwood has emerged despite what from the outside may appear to insurmountable obstacles.Wakaliwood is also lending credence to a Ugandan pop culture that some observers have linked to Quentin Tarantino for convenience. But it can only be understood by going beyond the violence that flows through the stories, the litres of food colouring that stains the fallen, and the archaic and mischievous special effects.For the bloody special effects, condoms are filled with food colouring and tied with a plastic ribbon around the chest of a stuntman. A metal ring is glued to the condom and fishing wire is attached to it, to be pulled by an assistant at the appropriate time. Cow blood was used in the past but some of crew members became ill after accidentally swallowed it.In a Wakaliwood movie, there are always tens of gangsters, hoodlums or bad guys whose main job is to be killed by the good guys. To attain the high body count, the bad guys wear balaclavas, or caps, or beards. This allows crew members to play numerous baddies destined for a bloody end.The film-maker’s half-brother Robert Kizito discovered kung fu 30 years ago through Bruce Lee’s films. Mimicking them to his brother, Kizito was bitten by the martial arts bug while inspiring Nabwana towards a love for the films. He scoured central market of Kampala for Chinese martial arts magazines to dissect the positions from the diagrams inside their pages. A kung fu master, Kizito and his followers where filmed by his brother for Wakaliwood’s first ever action scenes.Nabwana was child during the bloody rule of Idi Amin. The film-maker recalls the swollen corpses in a dumping ground near his home and the soldiers drumming at the doors of the houses, shouting: “Fungua mlango, panda gari” (“Open the door, get in the truck” in Swahili) Mixing memory and his love Bruce Lee films, Nabwana has emerged as unique film-maker.Eaten Alive is a movie inspired by a cannibalism case that happened a few years ago in western Uganda.Wakaliwood has captured the imagination of a nation, from the drivers of boda boda, (motorbike or bicycle taxi) to President Yoweri Museveni who did not hesitate to incorporate support for the industry as a campaign promise, during the 2016 presidential election.A VJ adds extra colour to a movie with their jokes, gamut of expressions,tone, rhythm, the turn of phrase and extra dialogue. Emmie is part of the Wakaliwood family. He comments on every movie and his commentary is part of the movie. Nabwana said he cannot shoot a movie without considering Emmie’s commentary. Audiences pay 500 Ugandan shillings (20p) a ticket for a US blockbuster and 1,000 shillings (42p) for a Wakaliga movie.I have been going to Wakaliwood for years, but I have not managed to unravel the mystery of Nabwana’s trajectory. It is the defiance of the impossible, like the life-size Bell Huey helicopter by the props crew in the yard of his family compound. Visitors describe him as a pop-culture prophet preaching from his slum the good word of cinema, communicating a certain idea of his country rather than basking the sun of international film festivals.All photography by Frédéric Noy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f9755d0bc32310e0e82d158958801e14714cf8/0_0_3059_1836/master/3059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c82ca20aaed9f1fe91cf87497c3bf300","title":"ethiopia eritrea abiy ahmed charismatic young peacemaker","story":"The flags of the two nations flew bright and sharp. The two leaders waved at the happy crowds. The formal meetings overran, amid ostentatious displays of bonhomie. Even the hatchet-faced security officials appeared relaxed.The meeting of Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s 41-year-old prime minister, and Isaias Afwerki, the 71-year-old president of Eritrea, in Addis Ababa on Saturday left seasoned Africa observers gasping for breath.“The pace of this is simply astounding,” said Omar S Mahmood, of the Institute for Peace and Security Studies in Ethiopia’s booming capital.The meeting between Abiy and Isaias concluded an intense bout of diplomacy that appears to have ended one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts. “Words cannot express the joy we are feeling now,” Isaias said, as he had lunch with Abiy. “We are one people. Whoever forgets that does not understand our situation.”Many Ethiopians expressed their exhilaration on social media. “The events of these past … days between Ethiopia and Eritrea are like the fall of the Berlin Wall. Only amplified 1,000 times,” Samson Haileyesus wrote on Facebook. The reaction in Eritrea has been equally ecstatic.Analysts say such hyperbole may be justified. The bid for peace with Eritrea is just the latest in a series of efforts that may bring revolutionary reform to Africa’s second most populous nation, transform a region and send shockwaves from the Mediterranean to the Cape of Good Hope.Since coming to power in April, Abiy has electrified Ethiopia with his informal style, charisma and energy, earning comparisons with Nelson Mandela, Justin Trudeau, Barack Obama and Mikhail Gorbachev. He has reshuffled his cabinet, fired a series of controversial and hitherto untouchable civil servants, including the head of Ethiopia’s prison service, lifted bans on websites and other media, freed thousands of political prisoners, ordered the partial privatisation of massive state-owned companies, ended a state of emergency imposed to quell widespread unrest and removed three opposition groups from a list of “terrorist” organisations.Nic Cheeseman, an expert in African politics at Birmingham University, said Abiy’s extraordinary campaign was a test of the argument that only repressive government can guarantee the levels of development so desperately needed across Africa.Despite an International Monetary Fund forecast predicting that Ethiopia, which has relied on a centralised economic model and political repression for decades, would be the fastest-growing economy in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018, even the officially sanctioned press has admitted the country’s serious difficulties.There is a shortage of foreign currency, growing inequality, a lack of jobs for a huge number of graduates, environmental damage, ethnic tensions and deep hunger for change.“Ethiopia was on the edge of the abyss. They have realised they cannot continue in the same old way. Only an advanced democratic system would prevent the country coming to pieces and a disaster that Africa has never seen before,” said Andargachew Tsege, a British citizen unexpectedly pardoned in May after four years on death row on terrorism charges. Abiy invited Tsege, who was abducted by Ethiopian security services four years ago, to a meeting two days after his release. They spoke for 90 minutes.No one claims that Isaias, the “hard and rigid” ruler of Eritrea since 1991, has much in the way of new ideas. A nation of about 5.1 million people, Eritrea is the only African country where elections are not held. As many as 5,000 Eritreans flee their country every month, notably to avoid indefinite military conscription. Many head to Europe. The economy has flatlined for decades. The UN has accused the regime of crimes against humanity.Once a province of Ethiopia that comprised its entire coastline on the Red Sea, Eritrea voted to leave in 1993 after a decades-long, bloody struggle.The thaw began last month when Abiy said he would abide by a UN-backed ruling and hand back to Eritrea disputed territory. Analysts say conflicts across the region fuelled by the rift are now likely to die down.For the moment Abiy’s reforms have popular support, and the crucial backing of much of the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, the rebel coalition that came to power in 1991.But there is resistance. Last month, a grenade was thrown at a rally organised to showcase support for the reforms in Addis Ababa’s vast Meskel Square. Two died. “Love always wins ... To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded,” Abiy said after the attack.Much depends on the determination of the Ethiopian leader. Seen as a relative outsider before being picked for the top job by the EPRDF council, Abiy is the first leader from Ethiopia’s largest ethnic community, the Oromo, who have complained for decades of economic, cultural and political marginalisation. The EPRDF is split by battles between four ethnically based parties as well as fierce competition between institutions and iniduals.As Abiy’s reforms gather momentum, the risks rise too. “Democracy can be achieved through benevolent leadership, but it can only be consolidated through democratic institutions. What we are seeing now is more of a personality-cult kind of movement,” said Mekonnen Mengesha, a lecturer at Wolkite University.Like other African countries– such as Kenya and Zimbabwe just over a decade ago – Ethiopia has seen previous efforts to reform its closed, autocratic system that have not ended happily.“It’s really exciting and great news, but Abiy has not done anything that really threatens the regime,” said Cheeseman. “And until a government is actually faced with losing power you don’t know what will happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56075522795158e98c1a583ba43b487ff70399e9/0_189_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3158ada567808277e721ccaa12938edf","title":"liu xia freedom hostage to china crackdown","story":"As hundreds of people gathered in Berlin’s Gethsemane church to remember and celebrate Chinese activist Liu Xiaobo – the writer and Nobel peace prize laureate – on the first anniversary of his death, one slight woman was conspicuous by her absence.His widow, poet Liu Xia, had landed in the German capital just days earlier, after her surprise release from nearly eight years of house arrest in Beijing. But although she has been allowed to leave after years of protests and petitions, she is still not totally free. Berlin-based friend Tienchi Martin-Liao, who had been Liu Xiaobo’s editor, said she was not able to appear in public or speak to media because of worries about her brother Liu Hui, who is still in China.“It’s not really her will. She is free, but she still cannot enjoy complete freedom because her brother is still in Beijing in the hands of the government,” she said.Liu Xia originally insisted she would not leave China without her brother, who was convicted on fraud charges over a property dispute in 2013, in a case activists believed to be retribution against the family.Martin-Liao stopped short of saying Liu had been threatened about the consequences for her brother if she were to speak publicly, but fellow writers and activists agree that he is being held to ensure her compliance. It is a tactic they fear is being used more often to hobble dissident communities abroad, even as China’s fast-growing wealth and political influence has made it easier for the government to ignore calls to free jailed opponents.“The Chinese Communist party has become more immune to international pressure to release activists and let them go overseas, coinciding with its growing economic clout,” said Frances Eve, a researcher at Chinese Human Rights Defenders. “Nowadays, on the rare occasion it does allow an activist to go abroad, it’s with the sinister knowledge that their immediate or extended family remains in China and can be used as an effective hostage to stifle their free speech,” said Eve.So as friends, allies and colleagues gathered for songs, speeches and tributes, exactly one year after Liu Xiaobo’s death in custody from liver cancer, Liu Xia stayed at home to remember her late husband in private.“She was not totally alone. In a very quiet atmosphere, she had a dialogue with Liu Xiaobo. In her way, very quietly she touched him,” said Martin-Liao, who has spoken regularly with Liu Xia over the phone for nearly a decade but only met her in person last week.Liu had effectively been under house arrest since 2010 after her husband was awarded the Nobel peace prize in absentia. He was jailed in 2009 for his hand in writing a political manifesto, Charter 08, calling for peaceful political reform and the end of one-party rule.Liu died in 2017 of liver cancer after being denied permission to leave the country for medical treatment. Liu Xia herself was never charged with any crime but Chinese authorities apparently feared she could become a figurehead for protestors. She was restricted to her Beijing apartment, where she was kept virtually incommunicado and under heavy surveillance, occasionally allowed to leave for short trips or receive visitors, but denied a passport. She battled severe depression and threatened to kill herself earlier this year, so news of her surprise release was greeted with joy by friends and activists.But they warned that her sudden freedom should be celebrated as a unique success, not as a sign of broader progress for human rights as President Xi Jinping presides over a long crackdown on activists and civil society. “It should be said very clearly, the human rights situation is deteriorating and is as bad as before,” Martin-Liao said.A harsh jail sentence handed down to another dissident the day after Liu’s departure appeared to underline the government’s position. A court in central Wuhan city sentenced 64-year-old Qin Yongmin to 13 years in prison for subversion.When Qin, who has been pushing for democratic reforms since the 1970s, is released, he will have served almost half of his life, or 35 years, in prison. Last week also marked the anniversary of the “709 crackdown” where more than 300 lawyers and activists were imprisoned, tortured, or disappeared.Within China, friends of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia were also taken on forced vacations to keep them from staging any memorials. “Nothing has really changed,” says Wen Kejian, a writer and activist friend of the couple.Liu’s release has been widely attributed to pressure and negotiations from the German government, and some have taken that as proof that public campaigns and diplomatic pressure do work. But Wen attributes it more to China’s need for allies in Europe during a time of tension with the US. “China has become more and more stubborn and more aggressive to push for its own agenda. Diplomatic pressure or public opinion really don’t mean as much as they used to,” Wen said.The venue for the Berlin memorial service, the Gethsemane church, was a hotspot for East German dissidents during the cold war.

Forced into hiding, they were saved by a Muslim boy who risked his life to smuggle them to safety.“My hope is that a day of commemoration will stimulate a much-needed conversation,” says Kane.Partition has been described by the Pakistani-American historian Ayesha Jalal as “the central historical event in 20th-century south Asia”, and Rani, who won a 2018 Royal Television Society Award for My Family, Partition and Me, agrees that there is a desperate need to remember an event that saw more than 15 million people uprooted in one of the largest migrations in history, and which led to the deaths of between one and two million, most of them killed in shocking acts of sectarian violence between the country’s Hindu, Sikh and Muslim communities.“One of the reasons I made the original film was because I was really shocked how few people knew about this period of history,” Rani says. “After partition, India was too busy celebrating independence, Pakistan was celebrating the birth of nation, Britain was relieved to have been able to cut and run, so no one talked about how they’d got there and what had happened.“It’s become this dark stain, but an event such as this could change that. It’s a way of involving not just the south Asian community but everyone in Britain in a reflection on the past and a conversation about what happened and where we are now.”And there is evidence of a growing desire throughout the country for such a debate.“Since I first suggested the idea of a partition commemoration day I’ve been contacted by people from all kinds of backgrounds, young and old, Sikh, Punjabi, Pakistani, Hindu and white,” says Kane.“People have said ‘How can we move this forward?’ and offered their services and asked ‘Can I get involved?’ It’s really struck me how many people have a personal connection to the events of partition and want to discuss both what happened and what this means to those of us living in Britain now.”For Kane’s father, who describes the events of 71 years ago as “like a raw wound covered with paper”, an annual event would help people to not only come to terms with the past but also understand how easily the bloody events following partition could occur.“We lived in harmony and yet when the spark was lit the whole thing blew up and the hatred and ision continues in bits and pieces to this day,” he says. “This project will allow people to remember the horrible things that happened and to learn from that. It will remind people so that it doesn’t happen again.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3561253.1531308946!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clifftops have given me some of the high point of my life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“The view from the top balcony can be sublime.” Illustration: Michael VineyA good many of the high points in my life have perched me, appropriately, on clifftops. Prostrate among island sea pinks above seals and wheeling seabirds, or crouched among Arctic rocks to watch polar bears parading on the frozen fiord below, the view from the top balcony can be sublime.With or without wildlife, the view is what enchants summer tourists on the Wild Atlantic Way. On TripAdvisor, some hundreds of visitors to Donegal’s Slieve League have been ecstatic. “Dramatic scenery, history, elemental nature, and the freshest air in all the world. Powerful!” sets the tone.We oldies, of course, remember Slieve League before the fenced viewing platform, the shuttle bus up from the visitor centre, the car parks and craft shop, the ice cream van and “yummy” lobster rolls at the top. Clutching each other, well back from the edge, 600m above the sea, we muttered “Oh my God!” into the wind long before that cry went acronymic and digital.Together with the seashore between the tides, the cliffs of Ireland are the island’s last wild – or “least modified” – land. Hard and metamorphic at its storm-lashed western rim, soft and crumbly in glacial boulder clay, they make up a fifth of the coastline.All of them qualify for periodic monitoring as “EU Annex 1 habitat Vegetated sea cliffs of the Atlantic and Baltic coasts” under Europe’s nature directives. Peering up through binoculars from boats or tidal shores, lowered (exceptionally) on ropes, or peering at good helicopter and telephoto images, a team of botanists has done its best to identify and map what’s growing at almost 200 locations, 32 of them surveyed in person (see Irish Wildlife Manual No 53 at npws.ie)Most are at least partly within NPWS conservation sites, offering some clout against rubbish tips and car dumps (a special temptation on islands) or misplaced rock armour at the base. A more natural “threat” is invasion by alien plants, such as gunnera, cotoneaster, escaped garden hebe and silvery ragwort, all documented in the NPWS survey. Native vegetation begins with the black skirt of lichen at the splash zone of Atlantic cliffs and a progression of salt-resistant plants to the windy fringe above.At every crevice and ledge, flowering cushions of sea pink are the most frequent plants, but surveys with ropes found more than twice as many species as could be spotted in remote photographs, filling in the plantains, wild thyme, mosses and lichens.The tallest cliff in the survey was at Achill’s Slievemore (660m to 670m), and the longest stretch centred at Glinsk on the north Mayo coast. This offers a remarkable 68km of swoops and crags, historical haunt of golden and sea eagles.The stiff-winged fulmar was noted as the commonest breeding seabird. Since it first arrived in Mayo in 1911, the fulmar’s coast-wide spread and assiduous trawler-stalking have helped keep its population relatively secure, though the falling numbers of young fulmars echo a wider seabird decline.Among the thousands of birds lining the ledges of island and mainland cliffs, the most exposed positions are taken by the guillemot. Dispensing with a nest, it relies on the conical (pyriform) shape to its egg to stop it rolling off. A coating of sticky guano also helps, but accidents happen and starfish swarm to an eggy, seabed banquet at the foot of some cliffs in Kerry.The clamour of the bird colonies peaks in early summer and begins to quieten down this month as partly-grown chicks flutter down to the sea, paddle feet splayed, and shepherded by a parent. This happens at dusk in failing light to avoid the beaks of great black-backed gulls and skuas.Puffins are mostly gone in a rapid desertion in August. The single chick has been fed by both parents, flying back to the burrow among clifftop sea pinks with their notched bills lined – ideally – with sandeels.Human impacts (global warming sending the sandeels north, the global ocean litter of plastic pellets) have led to damaging changes in puffin diet, to impossibly spiny fish species or gulletfuls of plastic lentils. But new research suggests another, biological, factor.An international study, led by Oxford University and involving UCC scientists, tracked the journeys of 270 puffins from a wide range of breeding grounds around the Atlantic to feed in winter on shoals of oil-rich capelin off North America. Irish birds, taking a circuitous route, made the longest journeys – up to 4,700km there and back. They arrive to breed at our cliffs so exhausted that they lay only one egg and struggle to feed the chick. So suggests the study published in Current Biology and reported fully at https:iti.ms2J6yN9z. All the more reason, says study co-author Mark Jessopp of UCC, to care for the puffins we’ve got.

Photograph: Frank MillerIrish Water has indicated there is a possibility of night-time water restrictions extending outside the greater Dublin area.Angela Ryan, water resources manager at the utility, said it was looking at “varying levels of restrictions in various areas”.“We’re looking at resource management right across the country, the amount of water available in supply and the demand for water,” she said. “Right now as part of the existing drought conditions, we’re looking at similar issues right across the country.”A number of areas across the country are already affected by night-time water restrictions from 10pm until 6am, including parts of Carlow, Galway and Limerick.Ms Ryan said the night-time restrictions will allow water conservation be achieved through a combination of reduced usage and leaks from the system.“It will be a combination of both but obviously leakages are over 24 hours and usage tends to be over 12 hours,” she said.Darragh Murphy, communications manager with Irish Water said the restrictions are at night in order to try and limit the impact on homes and businesses.“What we’re trying to do is put on those pressure restrictions and do that at a period of time that least disrupts the economy and people going about their daily lives,” he said.Irish Water said it was impossible to determine at this point how many litres of water would be saved per night as a result of the restrictions.Emma Kennedy, financial analyst and founder of Kenny Analysis, said the utility’s leakage figures were “off the charts”.Irish Water says it plans to reduce water leakage rates from 45 per cent to 38 per cent by 2021. The utility’s managing director, Jerry Grant, said earlier this year the Dublin network has a leakage rate of 37 per cent, amounting to 207 million litres a day.Pipes are being replaced at a rate of 1 per cent a year, the maximum possible “without bringing the city to a standstill”, he said.Ms Kennedy, who has done research on behalf of opponents of the Shannon pipeline plan, told The  “there will be major problems if Irish Water sticks with that target”.She said the 1 per cent replacement target meant “some of them will not to be touched for 100 years”.“Dublin will have a total nightmare in the coming decades with bursts and outages if Irish Water sticks with that target.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Night-time water restrictions will come into force in Dublin city centre and 33 suburbs across the greater Dublin area on Monday, Irish Water has confirmed.Pressure will be cut across Dublin for seven hours each night, with some households having only a “trickle” at the kitchen sink from 10pm until 5am. The restrictions will initially be in place for a week.Most of the affected suburbs are on the southside of the city, with just nine northside suburbs due to be hit with restrictions. While the restrictions will stretch through south Dublin all the way to Bray in north Wicklow, Beaumont will the most northerly suburb effected.Most households will experience low night-time pressures, but “no loss of supply” Irish Water said. However, supply to some customers on high ground and at remote end of networks “may reduce to trickle at kitchen sink”.In apartments, customers may experience low night-time pressures, depending on their building’s pumping and storage system, the utility said.There has been no significant rain for three weeks and the country is experiencing a drought. Met Éireann’s yellow status drought advisory was in place until midday on Friday.Met Éireann said it will be generally misty and cloudy over the weekend, with some hazy sunshine and scattered showers. Highest temperatures will be between 23 and 25 degrees with cooler conditions in Atlantic coastal areas.Kate Gannon, corporate affairs manager with Irish Water, said the restrictions will result in lower water pressure in some areas of Dublin, Wicklow, Meath and Kildare between midnight and 5am.Ms Gannon said there were already restrictions in 25 areas around the country. She said even if there was two weeks of heavy rainfall it would be soaked up by the parched ground immediately and would not see water sources replenished.“We need to get the soilmoisture deficit to over 10ml to get water levels to begin to rise,” she said.Ms Gannon said there was a base amount of water that is used over a 24-hour period of time. Some of it is usage and some of it is leakage, reducing water pressure overnight helps to reduce both.She said the utility has contacted its top 20 commercial users to determine their commitment to reduce water consumption. Irish Water also has a register of sensitive customers and asked that if anyone is concerned about their supply to get in touch.If anyone suffers a cut in supply, they are also asked to contact the utility.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy told the Dáil on Thursday water levels were at an all-time low in some parts of the country.He said of the 1,000 water supply systems controlled by Irish Water, nine schemes are currently experiencing severe drought, 51 are in drought condition and a further 77 in potential drought conditions.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"flight tracker shows sudden descent of ryanair flight","story":"  July 14, 2018Passengers bleeding from ears and oxygen masks dropped as plane landed in Frankfurt "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Restrictions will affect greater Dublin area between midnight and 5am from MondayBridge will be used by over 11,000 people a day to enter and leave Cork cityVictim\u0026rsquos SUV hits wall after leaving the N5 near SwinfordEmergency services attended victim (74) at Clondalkin home following \u0026lsquoearlier domestic dispute\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute believe the death followed a domestic dispute at a house in west Dublin on FridayPSNI says it is a \u0026lsquomiracle\u0026rsquo no officers were injured in six nights of violence in the cityThe child was among a group of four who got into difficulty just outside Kinsale HarbourCounter-demonstrators call for solidarity with refugees amid UK Freedom RallyAir Corps helps battle fire as Met \u0026Eacuteireann warns there is no end in sight to the droughtGerman investigators begin inquiry after flight made emergency landing near FrankfurtCulprits broke window and torched classroom, police sayVessel was named RRS Sir David Attenborough after the result of a public vote was vetoedCroatia-bound flight in emergency landingCar damaged after former Sinn F\u0026eacutein leader\u0026rsquos house targeted with explosive deviceProsecutors said Silk Road used to sell $200m worth of contrabandPassengers bleeding from ears and oxygen masks dropped as plane landed in FrankfurtThe legislation would ban imports from illegal Israeli settlements in Palestinian areasThe provenance of many Israeli goods is muddy and the rules can be circumvented"},{"url":null,"title":"inside the ryanair flight that made an emergency landing","story":"  July 14, 2018People seen bleeding from ears after Dublin flight to Croatia makes emergency landing   July 14, 2018Croatia-bound flight in emergency landing "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3565478.1531569227!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i thought we were done for passengers on ryanair flight describe emergency landing","story":"A Ryanair flight had to make an emergency landing at Frankfurt-Hahn airport due to inflight depressurisation.

Important that we survived’.A number of passengers on board the Ryanair flight from Dublin to Croatia that had to make an emergency landing in Germany have described their experiences.Dozens of passengers were taken to hospital complaining of headache and earache and suffering from nausea after the plane depressurised rapidly.Sarah McGarry, from Ratoath in Co Meath, spoke to The  from the basement at Frankfurt Hahn airport where she had been staying overnight.She explained the moment when the cabin started losing pressure:“We get on the plane, we’re flying and next of all the oxygen mask comes down, we’re left in darkness for 15 minutes, there’s no reassurance just people shouting ‘emergency, emergency’.“There was a newborn baby and children on the flight, people are screaming and we don’t know what’s going on for 15 minutes . . . Then finally we’re told that we’re going to Germany.”Another passenger, who did not want to be named, said “it was really scary, there were three to four minutes (that felt like an hour) when the plane was falling fast and I thought we were done for”.The passenger, who was travelling with three young children, said people were bleeding from the eardrums when they landed.Ms McGarry, who was travelling to Zadar for a holiday with her boyfriend, said her eardrum burst during the descent. However, she did not go to the hospital in an ambulance because she was not told if she would be back in time to catch the rescheduled flight, which was due to take off at 9.30am on Saturday.“My eardrum burst when the plane dropped and I was told I’d have to travel 70km to be seen at the hospital because that there were no doctors there available. I wasn’t reassured if I went that I’d be able to get back on the flight.“I chose not to go because if I travelled to the hospital I wasn’t reassured that I’d get back on the same flight and with the same passengers.”Ms McGarry says she has been “sitting in Germany on a cold hard floor for 11 hours now, all I’ve got to eat is a croissant and a coffee to the value of the €10 voucher we were given.“I was told I’d have to purchase anything else with my own money.”Ms McGarry’s boyfriend, Keiran Blunt, said their treatment by Ryanair has been “disgraceful”.“It’s disgraceful, I know these things happen but what really got me was the lack of reassurance from the company in general.“There was no reassurance from the captain, from the staff team at Ryanair, we were just left in limbo since yesterday.“The children here have been left without water, they’ve had no lunch provided to them.“There was a newborn baby on board, a few months old, and I had to steal water from a fridge here in Frankfurt just to provide the family with some water.“There’s young lads between 9 and 12 who’ve been given nothing with any nutritional value. We were let sleep here on a cold concrete floor.“I’m not one to complain, I take things in my stride it was quite disgraceful. It was atrocious. There was no apology and I’m a bit disappointed.”Conor Brennan (21), one of the passengers who was taken to hospital after suffering a severe build up of fluid behind his ears.He described the chaos on board:“Oxygen masks dropped and then about 20 seconds later the pilot made an announcement that he was going to make a controlled descent. Then we descended really, really fast for about 5 minutes. My ears felt like they were going to explode.“Then we levelled off and continued descending for about 10 minutes. We landed in Zadar airport, I remained on the plane for about 20 minutes despite requesting medical attention.“Eventually we disembarked and waited on the runway for another 20 minutes. We were then bussed over to a terminal, where we waited another 20 minutes before we received a medical brief, where they had a look at us.“There was another half an hour then before I received any kind of actual attention from a doctor, who gave me painkillers. Then an hour after that I was bussed to the hospital.“There was very little sign if at all of any Ryanair staff there. Airport staff and the German red cross were the only people I could see there who were helping.“The airport staff and Red Cross did their best to handle the situation, as Ryanair were nowhere to be seen, the first communication from Ryanair was this morning with food vouchers Ryanair .“They really displayed a shocking lack of empathy for their customers, almost bordering on inhumane.”In response to a query from The  on Saturday morning, Ryanair released a statement saying: “This flight from Dublin to Zadar (13 July) erted to Frankfurt Hahn due to an inflight depressurisation. In line with standard procedure, the crew deployed oxygen masks and initiated a controlled descent. The aircraft landed normally and customers disembarked, where a small number received medical attention as a precaution.“Customers were provided with refreshment vouchers and hotel accommodation was authorised, however there was a shortage of available accommodation. Customers will board a replacement aircraft which will depart to Zadar this morning and Ryanair sincerely apologised for any inconvenience.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3565561.1531588834!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pilots and passengers have just minutes before decompression knocks them out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tInside Ryanair flight FR7213 after the oxygen masks dropped. Photograph: Conor BrennanHumans cannot survive long at\u0026nbspthe heights reached during flights, because the air is so thin, and so aircraft cabins are artificially maintained at a pressure similar to that encountered at 8,000 feet or less.This is achieved by taking air from one of the engines after it has been compressed by a series of fan blades prior to being ignited to provide forward thrust. This is known as bleed air.Without artificially pressurised bleed air, passengers and crew suffer a condition known as hypoxia, which can cause them to lose what is known as “useful consciousness” within a few minutes. Indeed pilots rapidly lose the ability to make decisions and safely operate the aircraft if they fail to don oxygen masks within 30 seconds of an aircraft losing artificial pressure, or depressurisation.If the pressure in the cabin falls below that normally encountered at 14,000 feet, oxygen masks are automatically deployed in the passenger cabin and pilots receive a warning in the cockpit instructing them to don oxygen masks.Cabin crew are trained to recognise the early symptoms of hypoxia in passengers. This can include uncontrolled giggling and is sometimes noticed even before masks drop from the cabin ceiling.Once a depressurisation warning is received passengers have just 10 minutes of oxygen available to them from the masks and the pilots must immediately bring the aircraft to a lower altitude of 10,000 feet so everybody can again breath normally and safely. This usually means putting the aircraft into a steep and rapid descent which can alarm passengers as well as subjecting them to conditions which often result in serious discomfort, including severe ear pain.One of the worst examples of cabin depressurisation occurred in 2005 when a Helios Airlines Boeing 737 crashed in Greece killing 121. It was later discovered the the aircraft’s depressurisation system was not properly switched on after take-off so the pilots and passengers probably lost consciousness shortly after the airplane reached cruising altitude. The jet flew under autopilot until it ran out of fuel and crashed. In 1999 the wealthy US golfer Payne Stewart died when his private jet flew hundreds of miles after a depressurisation incident before also running out of fuel and crashing.Like other airlines, Ryanair has in the past experienced depressurisation incidents resulting in the deployment of oxygen masks. One of these, after taking off from the Spanish airport at Reus in 2004, was blamed on pilot error and resulted from taking off in a so-called bleeds-off condition when pilots deliberately do not switch on the pressurisation system to ensure greater engine power is available for taking off on short runways. Oxygen masks were deployed when the pilots failed to switch on the pressurisation system after take-off. The aircraft landed safely afterwards.However failure to switch on the pressurisation system is usually noticed shortly after take-off and the latest incident involving the Ryanair flight to Croatia, which occurred well into the flight, may have originated in mechanical failure of the pressurisation equipment and this may include the system of valves which maintain pressure in the aircraft cabin after it is depressurised. Failure of this valve system is not unknown and can result in rapid decompression.Structural failure on an aircraft can also result in decompression. Five hundred and twenty deaths, one of the largest death tolls ever in a single air accident, resulted from rapid decompression following a major split in the rear fuselage of a Japan Airlines Boeing 747 in 1985. In 1988 an Aloha Airlines air hostess was sucked to her death when part of the cabin roof peeled away on a poorly maintained airliner above Hawaii although in that case the pilots managed to land the aircraft safely.Earlier this year a US woman died after being partially sucked out of a Southwest Airline jet after her window was fractured by debris from an exploding engine."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3565586.1531592516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in to run presidential candidate against michael d higgins","story":"Sinn Féin has decided that it will run a presidential candidate against Michael D Higgins meaning a vote will now definitely take place in the autumn.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Lou McDonald speaking to reporters after the part meeting on Saturday. Photograph: Jack PowerSinn Féin has decided that it will run a presidential candidate against Michael D Higgins, meaning a vote will now definitely take place in the autumn. The decision was taken by Sinn Féin on Saturday after a meeting of the party’s ard comhairle, its executive board. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald told reporters on Saturday the Sinn Féin campaign would focus on having “a wider conversation” about the future direction of the country.“We have appointed a presidential election committee,” she said, which will run the process. The ard comhairle sub-committee will be chaired by David Cullinane TD, and will report in 10 days’ time with a process for how candidates can put their names forward. The ard comhairle will then select a party candidate from the nominees in the next number of weeks. Speaking outside the Hugh Lane Gallery, in Dublin city centre, Ms McDonald said: “Ireland and the world have changed very dramatically in the seven years since we last had a presidential election.” People under the age of 25 had never voted in a presidential election, she said, and “shouldn’t have to wait until the age of 32 to have this opportunity.”It would be “wrong” if citizens did not get a vote on the presidency “because the political establishment of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and Labour do not want an election”, she said. “A new generation has become politically engaged and have been central to changing Ireland for the better,” she said, referencing the marriage equality referendum and the recent vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment. “I want to commend President Higgins and his wife Sabina on how they have represented Ireland during the term of his presidency,” she said, but added the coming campaign “will be about the next seven years”.Ms McDonald said she “would not speculate on inidual names” on who might put themselves forward for selection as the party candidate. Potential runners who have been speculated as being in the frame include MEPs Lynn Boylan and Liadh Ní Ríada. There was a track record of presidential elections being “ugly and adversarial” campaigns, she said. Sinn Féin “will be fighting this campaign to win”, she said.President Higgins officially declared this week that he would nominate himself for a second seven-year term in Áras an Uachtaráin and would stand as an independent candidate. As the incumbent, President Higgins can nominate himself for re-election. Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell has previously said he is seeking nominations to contest the election, and Pieta House founder and Independent Senator Joan Freeman is also thought to be sounding out Oireachtas members for support. Seán Gallagher, who came second to President Higgins in the 2011 election, has written to all local authorities and asked them to facilitate the entry into the race of aspirant candidates. Candidates require the support of 20 Oireachtas members or four local authorities to secure a nomination. During the 2011 campaign President Higgins committed to only holding the office for one seven-year term, but it had been widely speculated for more than a year in the corridors of Leinster House that he would seek a second term. Former Lord Mayor of Dublin and Independent councillor Christy Burke had considered seeking a nomination in the last number of days, but on Friday ruled himself out. Mr Burke said he had been approached to run by several supporters, but following a “serious amount of consideration” decided against seeking to contest the race. “The financial end of running in the election would only put too much pressure on myself but also on my team,” he said. The Dublin City Council veteran said he hoped the housing crisis would be the main issue of the presidential election campaign. Fine Gael said this week it would canvass for the re-election of President Higgins and may use party resources to assist his campaign for a second term in Áras an Uachtaráin.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has confirmed his party would back Mr Higgins. The extent of Fine Gael’s campaigning has not yet been decided, but Mr Varadkar indicated it was willing to erect posters and use party literature to support Mr Higgins.Fianna Fáil, which is also backing Mr Higgins, is unlikely to follow suit, sources said, but the President’s former colleagues in the Labour Party will.Independent members of the Oireachtas are attempting to harness support from members of the Dáil, Seanad and county councils as they seek to field a presidential competitor. Responding to the news, Mr Craughwell said he was “utterly delighted” Sinn Féin were contesting the election. Mr Craughwell had sought a nomination to run on the basis that President Higgins should not be returned for a second term without an election.

A fan will also pull air around corners, as in our home.“The overall goal is to pull the warm air out while drawing cool air in once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature. Fans use hardly any power compared to AC.”  Mr Lebo added that while pointing the fan outside the window may seem counterintuitive to some, it is a lot more effective than the standard method.“The standard way simply pushes warm air around the room but we perceive it as cooling because moving air feels cooler than still air,” he says.“My technique of forced cross ventilation actually cools indoor air down by drawing in air cooled for free by nature that is just outside from late afternoon onward.”It could be time to turn that fan around He added: “Just make sure the bedroom windows are the ones with the air entering! The outward facing fan must be in the far end of the dwelling.”The UK enjoyed the hottest day of the year on Tuesday as temperatures peaked at 30.6C (87F), with the heatwave showing no signs of abating.Rebels and families begin evacuating cradle of Syria uprising after surrender dealPolice clash with protesters in Basra as unrest sweeps neglected sourthern cities of IraqDuchess of Sussex \u0026#39is struggling to cope and not answering my calls\u0026#39 says fatherDonald Trump going into Helsinki Putin meeting \u0026#39with low expectations\u0026#39Police finally announce arrest more than 36 hours after paraglider buzzes Donald Trump at TurnberrySt Swithin\u0026#39s Day: How a Saxon bishop\u0026#39s ire supposedly led to 40 days of rain – and what it could tell us about this year\u0026#39s summerComment: Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit proposal is so detached from reality that it can only end in disasterDonald Trump told Theresa May to sue the EU, PM revealsComment: We must resist Leftist zeal for PC recruitment drives \u0026#39Aladdin\u0026#39s cave\u0026#39 of Beatles memorabilia to go under the hammerJehovah\u0026#39s Witnesses must ask permission before collecting personal data on the doorstepSotheby\u0026#39s to host first all gold auction after demand surges from Asia and Middle EastFilm ensures Clementine Churchill is given her due at last Prince Charles tells gardeners to quiz nurseries on where their plants come from to halt spread of killer pestsDisagreement over electoral interference as Trump and Putin prepare to redraw the mapWoman survives seven days trapped after crashing car off California cliff by drinking radiator water Donald Trump says he will run for reelection as he calls the Queen \u0026#39a fantastic woman\u0026#39Dozens injured after mid-air pressure drop on Ryanair flightSoviet warship fired on Royal Navy helicopter 42 years ago, Foreign Office document revealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“ You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“ Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“ Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is. If someone says its Bush\u0027s urine, okay it\u0027s Bush\u0027s urine.“ There is a saying in Pashto that if you tell a Pashtun a dog has bitten off your ear, then the Pashtun will run after the dog, but won\u0027t check his ear to see if it\u0027s there or not.”Mr Butt still ides his time between Afghanistan and India.“ It\u0027s a very infuriating country but then at the same time you feel that you are doing some good,” he said.But the country\u0027s complexities can provide great radio, he said.“ You listen sometimes to The Archers and it\u0027s all \u0027the Environmental Agency is going to be coming and checking your land, because your land is contaminated\u0027 and this and that. It\u0027s really boring actually, the Archers. In Afghanistan, you have no shortage of really interesting issues to cover.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Rebels and families begin evacuating cradle of Syria uprising after surrender dealPolice clash with protesters in Basra as unrest sweeps neglected sourthern cities of IraqDuchess of Sussex \u0026#39is struggling to cope and not answering my calls\u0026#39 says fatherDonald Trump going into Helsinki Putin meeting \u0026#39with low expectations\u0026#39Police finally announce arrest more than 36 hours after paraglider buzzes Donald Trump at TurnberrySt Swithin\u0026#39s Day: How a Saxon bishop\u0026#39s ire supposedly led to 40 days of rain – and what it could tell us about this year\u0026#39s summerWhy turning your fan around can help you sleep better in a heatwaveComment: Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit proposal is so detached from reality that it can only end in disasterDonald Trump told Theresa May to sue the EU, PM revealsComment: We must resist Leftist zeal for PC recruitment drives \u0026#39Aladdin\u0026#39s cave\u0026#39 of Beatles memorabilia to go under the hammerSotheby\u0026#39s to host first all gold auction after demand surges from Asia and Middle EastJehovah\u0026#39s Witnesses must ask permission before collecting personal data on the doorstepFilm ensures Clementine Churchill is given her due at last Prince Charles tells gardeners to quiz nurseries on where their plants come from to halt spread of killer pestsDisagreement over electoral interference as Trump and Putin prepare to redraw the mapWoman survives seven days trapped after crashing car off California cliff by drinking radiator water Donald Trump says he will run for reelection as he calls the Queen \u0026#39a fantastic woman\u0026#39Dozens injured after mid-air pressure drop on Ryanair flightWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/14/TELEMMGLPICT000169335928_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqAiJQrZkdRSYRHeCDHXkbf6Ii28cHE832aQ649NGemwU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir david attenborough launches boaty mcboatface polar ship","story":"digitalservices@telegraphSir David Attenborough presses the launch button on the slipway at Cammell Lairddigitalservices@telegraphSir David Attenborough said Britain\u0027s new polar research ship which bears his name could be key to preserving the planet as he launched it for the first time.The veteran broadcaster pushed the button at the Cammel Laird shipyard in Birkenhead on Saturday to allow half of the 10,000-tonne vessel to slip into the River Mersey. The 92-year-old said it was an extraordinarily emotional moment as the £200 million ship, named the RRS Sir David Attenborough, entered the water.The vessel, which received more than 124,000 votes by the public to be called Boaty McBoatface in an online poll, is the most technically advanced survey ship ever built and will accommodate 60 scientists on research trips to Antarctica when completed.About 2,000 members of the shipyard and invited guests from the worlds of science, technology and engineering were on the slipway at Cammell Laird for the launch of the ship, which the public voted to name Boaty McBoatfaceSpeaking at the launch, Sir David predicted the ship would become a crucial asset in protecting the planet.He said: The perils facing this planet are far, far greater than they have ever been in its entire history, or at least since the end of the dinosaurs, certainly for the last few million years.There\u0027s nothing to compare with the perils we are facing, not only in the scale but in the speed at which they are happening and of course we now know that we are responsible for a lot of these changes that are taking place.You have to know what they are before you know how you can fix them so this ship is going to be key to the future salvage of our planet or at least its preservation.Sir David said Britain had paved the way as a pioneer of polar research with explorations dating back more than 100 years ago, in an apparent reference to Captain Scott\u0027s ill-fated Antarctic expedition.Sir David said: This country has been key in discovering what goes on down there.“Understanding what happens is of crucial importance to everybody in this country and indeed to the world.“Britain can be proud of the fact that it was key to the beginning of that sort of exploration and that it has brought it to this spectacular climax.”The Blue Planet presenter added: When 100 years ago this country sent people down to the South Pole, we were the pioneers in exploring the Antarctic.“When we did so, I expect the reason we did was the South Pole seemed as far away as it could possibly get to be on this planet.Now, 100 years later, we realise that remote place is, in fact, key to the whole understanding of the planet. What goes on down there affects the whole of the earth in which we live.Captain Robert Falcon Scott led a team of British explorers to become the first to reach the South Pole, on what was his second Antarctic mission.His party arrived at the South Pole on January 17 in 1912, but found they were beaten there five weeks earlier after Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen led his own expedition. Scott and his explorers died on March 29 while returning from the trek after a planned rendezvous with support teams failed.Speaking after tug boats had manoeuvred the vast steel hull down the slipway at Cammell Laird, Sir David said: “It was an extraordinarily emotional moment. I\u0027m surprised myself really.I\u0027ve never seen a ship of that size get down a slipway and there was something very noble about it and very emotional. Irresistible.And, to think that it\u0027s going to go to the other end of the globe and do such valuable work and carry so many people from this country who will be working to find out all they can about the working of our planet is a marvellous thought.”Sir David and Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of BAS, pressed the button to launch the vessel into the water in front of more than 2,000 shipyard workers, scientists, engineers and guests.In the water, tugboats pulled the ship into a “wet basin” where construction work will continue. Once complete the vessel will be comprised of one million pieces of steel, 30km of piping, 5,000 valves, and 450km of cabling.Please review our commenting policyRebels and families begin evacuating cradle of Syria uprising after surrender dealPolice clash with protesters in Basra as unrest sweeps neglected sourthern cities of IraqDuchess of Sussex \u0026#39is struggling to cope and not answering my calls\u0026#39 says fatherDonald Trump going into Helsinki Putin meeting \u0026#39with low expectations\u0026#39Police finally announce arrest more than 36 hours after paraglider buzzes Donald Trump at TurnberrySt Swithin\u0026#39s Day: How a Saxon bishop\u0026#39s ire supposedly led to 40 days of rain – and what it could tell us about this year\u0026#39s summerWhy turning your fan around can help you sleep better in a heatwaveComment: Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit proposal is so detached from reality that it can only end in disasterDonald Trump told Theresa May to sue the EU, PM revealsComment: We must resist Leftist zeal for PC recruitment drives \u0026#39Aladdin\u0026#39s cave\u0026#39 of Beatles memorabilia to go under the hammerJehovah\u0026#39s Witnesses must ask permission before collecting personal data on the doorstepSotheby\u0026#39s to host first all gold auction after demand surges from Asia and Middle EastFilm ensures Clementine Churchill is given her due at last Prince Charles tells gardeners to quiz nurseries on where their plants come from to halt spread of killer pestsDisagreement over electoral interference as Trump and Putin prepare to redraw the mapWoman survives seven days trapped after crashing car off California cliff by drinking radiator water Donald Trump says he will run for reelection as he calls the Queen \u0026#39a fantastic woman\u0026#39Dozens injured after mid-air pressure drop on Ryanair flightWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2018/07/05/TELEMMGLPICT000127400591_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth","title":"must resist leftist zeal pc recruitment drives","story":"digitalservices@telegraphThe fact that companies are discriminating against children whose parents went to university is ludicrousLet\u0027s end the discrimination against people who do not fit into Left-wing conceptions of  \u0027victim groups\u0027   Something worrying is happening in British companies.

is to hold its first ever auction entirely dedicated to gold after a spike in demand for artefacts and furniture made with the precious metal.The auction was announced following “increasingly strong demand” for gold from clients in markets such as Asia, Russia and the Middle East.The event due to be held later this year will feature a solid gold head of supermodel Kate Moss and a gold chair which once sat in Napoleon\u0027s Throne Room.Senior director and head of sale Constantine Frangos said: “We have seen increasingly strong demand for gold items from our clients so this the the first all gold auction being held by Sotheby’s and every department is contributing so we are going to get a real variety of items.“Gold has always been a universal symbol of status and has huge historic

contemporary art, ancient texts on the craft of goldsmithing a merging of old and new styles of gilded artmaking through the ages.Among the items to be sold is a Paul Mak artwork, estimated to fetch between £8,000 and £12,000. “This is my favourite piece so far,” said Mr Frangos.“It is not one of the most expensive pieces to feature in the auction but the level of detail is quite remarkable.” A solid gold head of supermodel Kate Moss has a guide price of up to £400,000Kate Moss in Marc Quinn’s Song of a Siren is also to feature in the sale, with an auction estimate of £300,000 to £400,000.“The Kate Moss by Marc Quinn is truly something special as it is solid gold and extremely iconic,” he added.The cast is made from 18 carat solid gold and weighs more than 8000 grams.Mr Frangos said that it was the status symbol that gold embodies which has made it such a popular metal and that it was often the “unique and historic” nature of the items which really piqued client and collector interest.He added: “With this being Sotheby’s first all gold auction we are going to see how it goes before considering if we do them elsewhere outside of London, but even at this very early stage we have seen a huge amount of interest which is very exciting.”Please review our commenting policyRebels and families begin evacuating cradle of Syria uprising after surrender dealPolice clash

meeting that would have protected breastfeedingDonald Trump’s administration has threatened Ecuador with trade sanctions if it\u0026nbspintroduces a United Nations resolution to encourage breastfeeding.The US had supposedly asked for language asking governments to “protect, promote, and support breastfeeding” to be removed. The resolution ultimately passed but not before world health officials were shocked at the behaviour of the US delegation at the May UN World Health Assembley\u0026nbspin Geneva, the New York Times reported.\u0026nbspEcuadorians, facing having important military aid from the US rescinded on top of harsh sanctions on critical goods, backed down. But, the US did not threaten Russia in the same manner.\u0026nbspAn unnamed Russian delegate said the country stepped up to back and help pass the resolution because they felt\u0026nbsp “it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.The delegation was also opposed to another section of the resolution which called on countries to curtail promotion of products that medical experts agreed could cause harm to children according to more than a dozen delegates to the health meeting, the majority of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the US, according to the newspaper.Though US\u0026nbspefforts were unsuccessful since the bulk of the original wording survived two whole days of procedural talks, language calling for “inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children to end was removed due to US efforts.\u0026nbspThe US mission to the UN nor the State Department responded to a request for comment.\u0026nbspIt appeared,\u0026nbsphowever, the US was asking to have the language removed as a sign of support for the $70bn\u0026nbspinfant formula industry which relies on mothers not exclusively breastfeeding. Baby food lobbyists were in attendance as observers to the meeting.The US also reportedly threatened to cut its contributions to the World Health Organisation - the US contributes almost 15 per cent of the agency\u0027s budget or $845m last year - if the resolution was introduced and passed.\u0026nbspIn light of the threat on Ecuador, other poorer countries in Latin America and Africa refused to introduce the resolution out of fear of American retaliation which left Russia to push it through.\u0026nbspBreastfeeding in public controversiesA woman has sparked a heated debate among parents after she revealed that she breastfeeds both her and her friend\u0027s son. Jessica Colletti, from Pennsylvania, said nursing Charlie Interrante\u0027s son “seemed like the natural thing to do” because she was already breastfeeding her son. Colletti told the Mama Bean parenting blog that she asked permission to nurse Interrante’s son when she began looking after him, after they met at a photoshoot for new mothers. Interrante agreed as her son had not taken to formula milkNew Hampshire State Rep.

My dad would probably like him. However, the reason I can imagine his frowning ghost at my shoulder is that it is Matt, and not me, who is painting my ceiling.I can imagine his look now, part bemused, part amused, part disappointed. Why, he would wonder, unless you are in traction or have had to undergo emergency amputation of all your limbs, would you not paint your own ceiling?Indeed, it’s something\u0026nbspthat doesn’t sit happily with me, hence the nervous hovering. I am wretchedly keen to be useful. Does Matt want a third cup of coffee? Should I move something? Maybe it’s enough to stand there, staring critically at the ceiling, rubbing my chin? Matt, on the other hand, really just wants to get on with the job at hand.My dad wouldn’t have been nonplussed at me getting someone in to do a simple job through any ideas of masculinity or anything like that it’s simply that he was a builder by trade and almost supernaturally handy.\u0026nbspA trait that, despite my best efforts over the years, has utterly failed to manifest itself in my genes.We are a nation of DIYers. Last month, the Confederation of British Industry revealed that there had been a boost in two areas of the retail economy, online shopping and DIY kit. This is in spite of – or perhaps because of – households still feeling that their incomes are being squeezed. Internet shopping tends to give access to more bargains while DIY is obviously a cheaper way of improving your home than getting tradespeople in.Aside from being innately handy, it was certainly economics that drove my father to carry out any household job himself, and in my own years of DIY that’s definitely been the driving force. In the 17 years or so we’ve lived in this house, there have been few projects I’ve not decided I can tackle myself. Several have ultimately required the intervention of a specialist. But I can’t deny the rosy glow of satisfaction I got from giving it a go.YouTube has allowed us to attempt jobs normally way out of our league (Getty )A survey a couple of years ago by Armstead, which supplies products to the building trade, revealed that while Brits love a good project in the home, we’re essentially a nation of bodgers, with one in ten of us actually injuring ourselves doing DIY, and there being on average more than 31 million unfinished jobs in British homes started by amateur improvers but never completed. What’s more, we spend on average almost £250 getting an expert in to fix what we’ve made a dog’s dinner of.A godsend to bodgers like me has been YouTube, where you’ll find helpful videos on pretty much anything you care to do, even projects that really should be way out of your league. YouTube has helped me take most of my house apart and put it together again in a way that you’d almost never notice.The only thing I won’t tackle is anything to do with the car, on the grounds that bodging a vehicle could quite easily end up in death or destruction of myself, my loved ones and innocent passers-by. This is despite my dad once nearly falling off his chair when I told him I’d paid a mechanic to service my car. “Why can’t you do your own oil change?” he’d said wonderingly, as though that was the most natural thing in the world, like breathing.Nomadic Homes – Architecture on the moveSo, if I’ve been so willing to roll up my sleeves and dig in, why is Matt up a ladder doing something as simple as painting my ceiling white, which is surely the easiest of DIY jobs imaginable, the sort of thing your nan could do?It’s a good question, and my nominal retirement from DIY has coincided with me becoming a full-time homeworker. Which, you might think, is a curious state of affairs. Working from home should, theoretically, give me more time to embark on projects, made doubly inviting by the lack of the usual spectators at evening and weekend fixtures who want to know if that thing really fits on the other thing, or if you should strictly be hitting that pipe with a hammer, or pointing out that you’ve missed a bit.But with the freelance life comes a more acute realisation that time is money. It’s all well and good when you’ve got a salaried job, spending a Saturday afternoon or a Wednesday night trying to work out how to re-hang the bathroom door after you’ve taken it off to saw a bit off the bottom, but once you start devoting time out of your freelance working day to this, it means you’re not actually earning money.Allied to that is the realisation that all those trades out there are in the same boat. We’re all in the gig economy together. I could take a day off to do a job and potentially lose a couple of hundred quid in earnings. Or I could pay someone else a couple of hundred quid to do a job. Swings and roundabouts, but ultimately am I not\u0026nbspsupporting my freelance colleagues by doing the latter?We spend an average of £250 getting someone in to fix what we have broken (Getty)But the primary reason for deciding to leave it to the experts is my long and ignominious list of failures, near-misses, and unfinished jobs, of which I will avail you of just a sample selection.There was the time the mixer tap broke on the kitchen sink. I resolved that we needed a new tap. The only thing was, I couldn’t get the tap out of its housing. Enterprisingly, I decided to remove the entire sink and had to walk across Bradford city centre with it on my shoulder to a plumber’s merchants to get a new one and plead with them to get the knackered one off.There is the ongoing situation with the bedroom, and I’m risking an almighty row by even just mentioning this. I decorated it from top to bottom last year, promising faithfully that I would tidy up all the scrappy bits of wallpaper hanging off corners and under coving and on skirting boards. I have yet to fulfil this pledge.And as an addendum to this sorry tale, there’s the issue of the DIYer being tempted to buy cheap to make the project even more cost effective. In this particular case, instead of going for more expensive and easier to hang paper where you paste the wall, I opted for the least expensive option which involved soaking in wallpaper paste paper that was already as thin as a Rizla\u0026nbsppaper, resulting in it ripping, tearing and sliding all over the place. For bonus points I used a knackered old stanley knife to cut the excess off. If you’ve ever tried to use a blunt craft knife to slice wet paper, you’ll be aware that the result looks like something chewed by a pigeon.DIY faecal transplants can spread diseases, experts warnI have umpteen stories of decoration going wrong, such as the time I decided to wood panel the walls in what was to become our baby daughter’s bedroom. I dutifully spent a day gluing the panelling all along the bottom half of the four walls, and got up the next morning to find it had all fallen off.But perhaps the most ill-advised project I ever undertook was tackling the problem of low water pressure in the bath, which involved taking apart an actual gas boiler. Don’t worry, I watched at least three YouTube videos before embarking on it, and I never actually touched any of the gas bits, just the water stuff. And it did actually work. But it’s not something I would advise, or would indeed have another go at.\u0026nbspAll of which is why Matt is up his ladders in my living room, painting. We had previously got him in to plaster the ceilings to render the horrible stipple effect completely smooth (as an aside, something I once briefly tried to do myself with a big tub of ready-mixed stuff. It all ended up on my head after resolutely refusing to stick). After watching him do it, I bit the bullet and asked him to come back and paint the ceilings. And now he’s going to come and paint the walls.I still do the odd thing, of course yesterday I put up two new light fittings, which took precisely three times longer than I thought it would and was accompanied by much sweating and cursing. But I make no apologies for retiring from the bulk of DIY. In fact, it’s hugely liberating.

I think there’s a lack of clarity of thought – it’s fairly obvious isn’t it?”Acknowledging the personal ambition and ideology that cloud the political debate, he says a scientific approach would not go amiss because “thinking scientifically is the opposite of thinking ideologically”.“When the flaws appear, as they did in Newton’s laws, we replace them. That’s the difference between politics and science.”While usually in politics, “rhetoric can get you through”, the rapidly approaching deadline for Brexit means the ideas set out by Britain’s Brexiteers and Remainers will soon be put to the test in the biggest experiment of a generation.“Brexit is kind of different, because there is a point in March next year when the idea is shown to be good or bad,” says Professor Cox.“That’s a much more scientific mindset, because we are going to test that theory and see whether it’s right or wrong… I’m concerned that’s yet to be understood by the political class.”Science news in picturesScientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 324 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 424 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.524 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed.

Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2424 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said.

No one could argue that – no one does actually,” he says.Nevertheless, Professor Cox has faith in people’s enthusiasm for science, and the role the media can play in fostering that enthusiasm.\u0026nbspNow 100 episodes into the Radio 4 show he presents with comedian Robin Ince, The Infinite Monkey Cage, they have tried to present science in a format digestible for everyone in order to avoid the ide between those who are sick of experts and those who aren’t.While there are still areas that have proved difficult to communicate effectively – particularly highly politicised ones like climate change and vaccinations – Professor Cox says it is up to these kinds of outlets to distil the essence of science for a broad audience.“A lot of responsibility falls at the feet of the media. Ultimately newspapers, TV stations and radio stations are the bridge between science and the public,” he says.He emphasises the importance of pushing more and more science into these outlets, and looking for new scientists “who are excited and want to communicate ideas to the next generation of the public”.“That’s very important,” he says.Watch or listen to the 100th episode of ‘The Infinite Monkey Cage’ on BBC iPlayer or watch on Red Button from Wednesday 18 JulyEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This has descended into a shambles.”Steve Baker MP, who resigned as Brexit minister after the Chequers summit, greeted the polls by tweeting: It looks like Chequers means Corbyn.Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun: This poll demonstrates, unsurprisingly, that voters have seen through the surrender paper.Theresa May has warned rebel Conservative MPs that Brexit might not happen at all if they do not back her plans.“We need to keep our eyes on the prize, she wrote in the Mail on Sunday.

should it be firmed or widened following talks with EU chief negotiator Michael Barnier, semantic differences remain between mutual recognition and equivalence.The approach is based on the UK keeping

Sometimes that’s the only way to sort stuff out.That’s what the US President Donald Trump is doing right now with his Nato allies. And it’s a mighty big sledgehammer.In the firing line is Angela Merkel, of Germany. And the other countries that are backsliding on their commitment to the civilised world’s safety and security.Trump thinks — and he’s right — that for far too long Europe and Canada have not been paying their share for our military defence. The Germans pay nowhere near enough. But even worse are the Belgians.Incredibly, Canada, led by that simpering idiot Justin Trudeau, spends scarcely more than one per cent of its GDP on defence. One of the richest countries on the world. The Spanish, as you might expect, pay four fifths of sod all. LESS than one per cent.Trump is telling them all they cannot depend on America any more. The US spends 3.5 per cent of its enormous GDP on the military. Much more than any other country in Nato.And as a consequence, Western Europe (and Canada) has been safe for decades. It was US military spending which led to the end of the Cold War and ultimately the break up of the “evil empire”, the Soviet Union.So where do we stand in all this? We spend more per head than our European partners, Estonia and Greece excepted. But still just the bare minimum of two per cent of GDP.And for years now we’ve been reducing our defence budgets. Cutting our armed services to the bone. Take the Royal Navy. In the 36 years since the Falklands War the number of warships we possess has reduced by a staggering 74 per cent.We now have a Navy which is 25 per cent smaller than it was in 1650 — when we had only a tenth of our current population. We were once a great maritime power. Today we’d do well to win a naval battle against Luxembourg — and that’s landlocked.Military spending does not create wars. It does the opposite. It makes them much, much less likely.The Falklands War against Argentina occurred because we had cut our spending on the Navy to the point where we no longer defended the far-flung islands. The Argies saw their chance and invaded.Luckily we still had a big enough Navy to respond and win back the freedom for the Falklanders. We couldn’t even dream of doing the same thing now.Meanwhile, the RAF has seen its number of combat aircraft cut by more than one third in less than ten years. We now have just 149. You probably saw them during the flypast on Tuesday, if you live in London. That was the lot. That’s it.The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. The US does that and we should do so, too — never mind the backsliding Europeans.The world is no less of a dangerous place than it was 30 or 60 years ago. Trump has got this absolutely right.NAZ SHAH is a Labour MP. Not so long ago she was suspended from the party.She had agreed with the foul and offensive idea that Israel should be “relocated” to the USA.Shah also compared the Israeli government to Adolf Hitler. Now she’s back in the party – and guess what? She’s been given a front bench role. As shadow equalities minister!They certainly take anti-Semitism seriously in Corbyn’s Labour Party. Surely there cannot be any Jewish people left in the country who would vote for this racist rabble.I’VE seen many remarkable things in my life. I’ve watched my team, Millwall, play in an FA Cup Final.I’ve seen the sun set at lunchtime in the Arctic Circle. I’ve talked to Arab terrorists, American presidents and famous pop singers. But there’s one thing I’ve never done.I have never, ever, in my entire life, met anyone who liked Danny Dyer. I was at party last week with people from all walks of life, and Danny’s name came up.The reaction was immediate. “Oh Christ, not that d**k . . .I think one woman even went behind a bush to be sick. Anyway, just thought I’d mention that.Maybe one day I will meet someone who likes Danny Dyer. And my life will be complete.IMPORTANT news story. Emily Ratajkowski is on holiday.We know this because she has very kindly sent the world some photographs of her break.But I will make sure to send back to The Sun some snaps of me lying on a sunbed with my a*se in the air, or posing in something alluring by a pool with a big pout on my chops. Enjoy.The EUS chief negotiator, Michel barnier wit Jeane-Claude Juncker - and the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.And that, frankly, is all you need to knowBEST news of the week, maybe of the year, was the heroic rescue of those young Thai kids from a flooded cave complex.It was an enormous, dangerous and brilliantly executed plan to get them out.And now, guess what? Hollywood is going to make a film about it all.YOU know the score, I don’t.All of my Wednesday is spent in a state of mental torture.What if we don’t crock Modric early on? When’s Harry going to start scoring again?I know the World Cup has been great fun. But does anybody actually ENJOY watching England – unless they’re 3-0 up? It’s too terrifying.Anyway, apparently there is a sharp rise in the birth rate when England win important football matches.Blokes take to their beds filled with passion.Me too, as it happens. And I like to relive the match by providing a loud commentary, in the manner of Jonathan Pearce, while I’m on the job.“Oh, just look at Liddle! He’s found a way through – AND IT’S IN!”ITALY has just turned away another ship full of migrants. It had been chartered by one of the many leftie charities bobbing about in the Med.Isn’t it time these mor- ons were prosecuted for people trafficking? Migrants now set off expecting to be picked up.

She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died a few days later. Gemma was just 40 years old.Simon had to tell their eight- year-old son Ethan that his mum was dead, and the two of them have been trying to cope ever since.Everyone mourns the death of someone they have loved and adored in different ways.There’s no timetable for grief, and no “one size fits all” way to get through the whole soul-crushing experience. For Simon, the death of his wife felt like a physical illness and being in intensive care.He decided to leave his job at Sky Sports to be with Ethan full time and they now both have an unbreakable bond.Simon is obviously very ­protective of his young son, but that works both ways.Ethan will often tell his dad that he is OK even when he is really suffering and missing his mum, because he doesn’t want Simon to worry about him, or to add to his dad’s pain.He sounds like a remarkable young lad who is a credit to both of his parents.For Simon, one of the worst things about Gemma’s death is the acute loneliness.After he has put Ethan to bed and he is in the living room, there’s no Gemma on the sofa watching TV or just chatting about the mundane events of the day.He often breaks down while making dinner for two rather than three, or emptying the dishwasher or doing other household tasks they used to share but that he now has to do by himself.It’s those little things that bind us together, and that we miss so very much.Simon told me that there are those who have simply not been in touch since Gemma died. It’s not because they don’t care, but because they just don’t know what to say to him and Ethan.It was interesting to hear him say that the most comforting sympathy he received was from a woman he bumped into in the supermarket, who knew Gemma from meeting her at the school gate.She simply told him that it was “utter crap, totally unfair and completely f*****g hellish”.And it is.When someone you love dies, it is utterly s**t and it does no harm to say that.Telling a bereaved person you are sorry for their “loss” is well meaning and comes with the best possible intentions, but we “lose” car keys, credit cards and dog leads.Those we loved are ripped from our arms and our hearts and it feels like the end of the world.Those feelings don’t really ever go away — you just somehow learn to live with them.We need to somehow try to make that process more bearable. So don’t avoid a devastated husband, a mother whose child has died or an elderly widow who is mourning her soul-mate.Talk to them and check in with them, because one day you will need them to comfort you.Essie, portrayed by Kaye Wragg, above, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, giving her no chance of ever having a much-yearned-for child of her own.Kaye gave her usual cracking performance, utterly believable and deeply moving. This storyline will have helped raise awareness of a cancer that is known as the “silent killer”.I hope we see more of Essie, as I always looked upon her as the quiet heart of Holby.If you missed this episode, make sure you go to the BBC iPlayer to catch up.WE’VE all had them – those house guests who overstay their welcome and are a complete pain in the bum.The disgruntled visitors who don’t like the food and complain the bed is too hard and won’t do a hand’s turn to help with the dishes or buy the odd loaf or bottle of wine.The ones where you do a jig when they have left and vow: “Never again.”So I sympathise with poor Mr and Mrs May, who have been putting up with the Trumps – veritable guests from hell.He’s the worst possible bullying boaster and you can imagine him dominating the conversation and being demanding and boorish.She has all the personality of a fembot and looks bored and disinterested at all times.Having the Trumps to stay was never going to be the easiest of rides for our PM and her husband.Aside from the thorny political discussions – and this week he has ripped up the rulebook and sold her down the river – there’s the distressing business of making small talk with this odd couple.I can just imagine Donald blowharding and manaplaining over pre- dinner drinks while poor Theresa becomes even more strained and develops a red stress rash on her neck.Her hubby Philip probably ended up talking to Melania about the weather.Trump has to be kept entertained like some bored little emperor, but you don’t want him to have too good a time that he will want to visit again soon.It’s a thorny one.Theresa has had the toughest of times recently, but she is made of strong stuff. While she might look a little tired around the eyes, our PM is no quitter – unlike the men who have let her down and put their own interests above those of the country.It might be trivial but I hope our PM can take some comfort in the fact she looked sensational in that sizzling red dress she wore to greet Trump.Theresa won the style battle with much younger ex-model Melania, who looked like a cut-price Belle from Disney’s Beauty And The Beast.Although Trump got it spot on as the Beast.FOR once this week, it wasn’t some poor actress who’d eaten a bowl of pasta for lunch and had a small, rounded belly being body-shamed.Russell Crowe was the subject of gleeful mirth by people who feel better about themselves by mocking others.Admittedly, the former buff star of Gladiator has piled on the pounds and looks like Thomas Markle’s older, larger brother. But by all accounts he’s chunked up for a movie role.Gladiator was 18 years ago and even Hollywood stars grow older and bigger. It appears, however, that equality in Tinseltown now means both women AND men being derided for not remaining visions of perfection and having the audacity to age.TODAY Serena Williams strides on to Centre Court to play for her eighth Wimbledon Ladies singles title.I have never seen a more majestic athlete on a tennis court since the heady days of my girl crush, Martina Navratilova.Serena is simply sensational and being a mother has made her even more hungry to win.It’s astonishing to think that just ten months ago, after the traumatic birth of her daughter and following multiple surgeries, she could hardly walk.Despite all she has gone through, I’ve never seen any athlete better prepared physically but also mentally.Serena can taste that title and no one is going to get in her way.I don’t envy her opponent, Angelique Kerber, today as it’s not just Wimbledon up for grabs.Serena also has her 24th singles grand slam in her sights, which would equal the record set by Margaret Court.Mrs Court was a hell of a tennis player but, as it turns out, not a great human being.She is a self-styled pastor in Australia and her views on gay rights and same-sex marriage are deeply distasteful.She claimed transgender children are the work of the devil, leading Martina Navratilova to label her “racist and homophobic”.So for that and so many other reasons, I’m firmly backing Serena today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course. We’re not as used to seeing Mr Trump have the grace to back down when one of his “fake news” jibes is proved wrong, as it was yesterday.That’s not just a special moment. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They say he tried to hide the fact that he was smoking but accidentally shut off the air-conditioning, causing oxygen levels to fall."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419780750.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"earthquake uncovers ancient aztec temple hidden inside pyramid in mexico","story":"Last September a devastating 7.1-magnitude quake wreaked havoc in central Mexico, killing 369 people as well as structurally damaging many of the countrys ancient monuments. But aside from its cost to human life, the killer quake was to reveal a secret dating from the depths of time - a temple inside the larger and newer temple.The ancient chamber - measuring 20ft by 13ft - was found nestling at the base of the Teopanzolco pyramid, which was an already archaeological site in the southern Mexican state of Morelos.Remains were found of ceramic crockery and an incense burner with all the hallmarks of belonging to the Tlahuica culture, an early form of the Aztec civilisation. This helped archaeologists to date the temple and conclude the temple was dedicated to the rain god Tlalo.Archaeologist Barbara Konieczna said: We are finding walls of a temple that, according to its location and architectural characteristics, was built early in the Postclassic Period (900-1521 AD).”Prior evidence suggests the Tlahuica people founded Teopanzolco and nearby Cuauhnahuac (Cuernavaca), but they were conquered in 1427 by Aztec emperor Moctezuma.Following their defeat, theses little known peoples were integrated into Moctezuma empire and obliged to pay takes and supply conscripts for its powerful army. Archaeologist Barbara Konieczna said: We are finding walls of a temple that, according to its location and architectural characteristics, was built early in the Postclassic Period. What we found was a temple inside the large temple.Teopanzolco is managed by Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH).The find comes after the discovery of a grisly Aztec “skull tower” revealed the true scale of human sacrifice in ancient Mexico.Research shows victims had their still-beating hearts ripped from their chests before their heads were cut off and added to a gruesome monument the size of a basketball court."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000420383952.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ancient egypt mummy workshop giza pyramids","story":"The discovery of the workshop along with a shaft, used as a communal burial place, was made at the Saqqara necropolis of Memphis, the first capital of ancient Egypt.Memphis, a Unesco World Heritage Site, and its vast necropolis are home to a wide range of temples and tombs as well as the three renowned Giza pyramids.The latest find, announced at a press conference today, dates back to the Saite-Persian Period, from 664-404 BC.The site, which lies south of the Unas pyramid, was last excavated more than 100 years ago, in 1900.In the mummification workshop, an embalmers cachette holding a large collection of pottery vessels, bowels and measuring cups were found.Archaeologists hope the findings will reveal more about the mummification process in the 26th Dynasty.We are in front of a goldmine of information about the chemical composition of these oils, said Ramadan Hussein, the head of the German-Egyptian mission.Among the artefacts found were fragments of mummy masks, jars used to keep the organs removed from the dead during mummification and an array of ancient pottery.Many will be displayed in the under-construction Grand Egyptian Museum, the first phase of which is expected to be inaugurated later this year.Archaeologists also found a gilded silver mask on the face of a mummy in a badly-damaged wooden coffin.The mask, the first to be discovered since 1939, belongs to a priest.Hussein said: The finding of this mask could be called a sensation.Very few masks of precious metals have been preserved to the present day, because the tombs of most Ancient Egyptian dignitaries were looted in ancient times.Down the 30-meter-deep shaft are a host of burial chambers carved into the bedrock lining the sides of two hallways.There lie several mummies, wooden coffins and sarcophagi.Its only the beginning, added Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani.He told reporters the sites will likely yield more discoveries after further excavation.Egypt has gone to great length to revive its vital tourism industry, still reeling from the political turmoil that followed a 2011 popular uprising."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004203746312.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"thomas markle believes meghan markle terrified of new life","story":"Thomas Markle sat down to talk of how he believes being a royal is piling pressure on his daughter — and branded them “outdated”.He fears Meghan, 36, is struggling to cope with the switch from bubbly TV actress to “prim” public duties as the Duchess of Sussex.Thomas, 73, said: “My thing about my daughter right now is that I think she is terrified.“I see it in her eyes, I see it in her face and I see it in her smile.“I’ve seen her smile for years. I know her smile. I don’t like the one I’m seeing now.“This one isn’t even a stage smile – this is a pained smile.“That might be just having a couple of bad days. I don’t know. It really worries me. I think she’s under too much pressure.“There’s a high price to pay to be married to that family.”US-born Thomas has watched from his £530-a-month rented home in Rosarito, Mexico, as Meghan adjusts to her new life.She and husband Prince Harry, 33, visited Ireland this week for their first tour as a married couple.But Thomas, often seen in jeans and a polo shirt, was bemused by his daughter’s “ridiculous” dress code. He added: “Meghan seems like something out of an old movie.“Why in 2018 are we dressing like the 1930s? Why do they have to cover their knees?”Thomas said the royals were freezing him out of his daughter’s life over his staged paparazzi pictures and controversial interview with Good Morning Britain.He added: “I think Meghan is in deeper than I am.“I’m not blaming Harry or anyone but they are following rules that don’t make sense to me.“They are no less human than anybody else. God knows, I feel sorry for them, for not being able to show emotion.“The reason I am being shunned is because I made a profit on the staged pictures.“Anyone who makes a profit off the Royal Family becomes shunned.“But I could have made well over $100,000 by just doing a talk show.“So if I moved to London and started selling cups with my daughter’s face on, would they shun me? The Royal Family is living by rules that are outdated.“Half of Great Britain seems to make a fortune selling pictures of my daughter and her husband. Are they shunned?“Does this make any sense to you or anyone else? I don’t get it.“I have already apologised to the Royal Family. I honestly think that if the Queen took the time to think that she would not see me because I did some stupid photographs, that is ridiculous.“I have had a fairly successful life. I’m fairly outspoken about certain things but I’m no different to any other father.”Ex-Hollywood lighting director Thomas, also dad to Samantha, 53, and Tom Jr, 51, was recuperating from heart surgery when Harry and Meghan married at Windsor Castle on May 19.Thomas had rented a £23-a-night pad to avoid prying eyes.He sat on the sofa and shed a tear at the moment Prince Charles walked Meghan down the aisle of St George’s Chapel.Thomas texted his daughter after the service, saying she looked beautiful. But he said talking to people since the ceremony has been painful.He said: “Every time I see or hear about that wedding, I am paying for it. It’s not easy.“Anytime anyone comes up to me and says, ‘So sorry, your daughter looked beautiful’.“For the rest of my life I’ve got to live that down.”Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland, who split with Thomas in 1988, was the only relative she had in church — a fact which saddened him.He also believes the royals should have gathered around yoga teacher Doria, 61, rather than letting her sit in a pew alone.And Thomas said his daughter could have used her skills as an actress to heal rifts among other family members.Instead celebs — including David and Victoria Beckham, tennis ace Serena Williams and chat show host Oprah Winfrey — were present to hear Harry and Meghan exchange vows.Thomas added: “I wasn’t shocked because Harry and Meghan have friends who are high rollers. They are all stars. But in a way it would have been nice if some of her old friends and wider family were there. I thought it was wrong to have Doria seated by herself.“There was no reason why she couldn’t have been with the royals.”He added ruefully: “I should have been there. Everyone was saying I was too terrified to walk her down the aisle, but I was ready to do it. I had a speech written. Meghan looked absolutely beautiful.”Thomas also spoke for the first time about the chaotic build-up to the wedding — dubbed the “Markle Debacle”.He almost blew a secret suit fitting by handing over his credit card at a store for big and tall men in Los Angeles.Thomas revealed: “Meghan had set up the fitting and I had a fake name when I walked in.“But then I saw a very expensive pair of jeans I liked and bought them with a card in my name.”He added with a wry smile: “The cashiers were very discreet about it, if they knew.”On May 8 his wedding plans were thrown into turmoil.Thomas, who had a heart attack around six years ago, felt another coming on.He said: “I was at home. I knew what was coming. It’s a sharp pain. After a while it turns into a heavy weight on your chest.“I thought I could die so I drove to the hospital. After that they sent me to the Red Cross.“They both gave me an electrocardiograph. Then I went to Rosarito General Hospital where they stabilised me.“After a day and a half I left the hospital. I thought stabilised meant I was cured. I got out and felt OK.”When he was exposed for staging paparazzi pictures six days before the wedding, Thomas initially pulled out of the ceremony in embarrassment. But he revealed: “Harry and Meghan called and said, ‘You don’t have anything to worry about.“You’ve got three suits waiting and shoes to wear’.“Harry said there would be this guy to be my Man Friday.“Arrangements were being made to take me to the airport.”Hours later he suffered more chest pains — just as a minder was set to take him to the airport.Thomas was rushed to Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center, ten miles over the US border, on May 14. He said: “I got a real heart problem and felt dizzy. I kept losing my balance and getting bad heart palpitations.“I called my friend and said you’ve got to take me to hospital.“I was supposed to leave for the wedding that night.“A guy named ‘Sarge’ called and said, ‘I’m going to pick you up and take you some place by the airport’.“I said, ‘Sorry, I’ve got to cancel. I have to go to hospital’.“He said, ‘I’ll pass that on, thank you very much’.”Doctors in Chula Vista realised that the arteries to his heart had become blocked and operated immediately. They went in through his groin and stuck three stents in his chest. Thomas said: “I’d like to thank all the wonderful staff at the centre and Dr Gennaro Fernandez. I am forever grateful.”Thomas is now on the mend but must take medication daily.Reflecting on the wedding, he added: “I was very happy to see Prince Charles step in and walk Meghan down the aisle.“I was sad it wasn’t me but very pleased it was him.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup.

shortage","story":"But experts warn our sweltering summer is leading to a shortage of so many key ingredients for our traditional lunch that we could soon be left with nothing but the gravy.Peas are the latest vegetable to come under threat as a lack of rain has resulted in crops being 20 to 30 per cent below their normal levels.And farmers say that potatoes, broccoli, carrots and cauliflower are also at risk, while chicken and pork supplies have been hit by a separate gas-related crisis in our poultry and meat factories.Guy Smith, the deputy president of the National Farmers Union (NFU), runs Wigboro Wick Farm in St Osyth, Essex, which has been left parched by the sunshine.He said: “I haven’t seen rain for 40 days and my fields are turning the colour of a digestive biscuit.People are comparing this weather to the great drought of 1976 when the vegetables just stopped growing.“We are already having problems with potatoes because they don’t do well in temperatures over 25 degrees and we’ve had that every day for some time now.“Peas, broccoli, carrot and cauliflower production will also be hit if this continues.“We are very worried about fires right now as the heat is turning the countryside into a tinderbox, so we are pleading with people not to use portable barbecues or release sky lanterns with flames.“If the dry weather carries on for another 40 days then price rises and shortages of your traditional Sunday roast ingredients are inevitable.”Britain is normally self-sufficient when it comes to producing the staples of the perfect Sunday lunch.For instance, around 97 per cent of the carrots we eat are grown on our own shores.But farmers say that a “perfect storm” of weather conditions is leading to a poor harvest in which the only thing flourishing is hay.Huge numbers of carrots pulled from the ground this ­summer are pencil- thin and experts say supplies could be disrupted for up to 11 months.The lack of rain also means that peas do not have enough water to fully grow, resulting in a smaller crop less suitable for dinner plates.Potatoes were already scarce after the Beast From The East cold snap in March hit production levels — and the heatwave has pushed up prices by around ten per cent, according to the NFU.Meanwhile, chicken and pork supplies are coming under pressure because of a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, which is used in the slaughter process and to preserve fresh poultry and meat.Nine of the UK’s largest poultry plants, which supply 60 per cent of our chicken, issued a warning last month saying they might have to cease ­production if the problem continues, and meat factories have also voiced ­concerns.There is a European-wide shortage of the gas.And with CO2 also used to carbonate drinks, there are fears that there may not be enough of the gas to go round, particularly given the amount of liquids we are sinking as the heatwave continues.She said: “If chicken and pork is in short supply you can use beef – the supply of which is less affected by the CO2 shortage – or a nut roast instead.Courgettes and baby onions might taste nice in a roast dinner.I would also recommend using spinach, as it is high in lutein, which is good for your eyes.“Butternut squash is a great alternative to potato and you could use sweet potato – high in vitamins C and E.But I will be really sad if we have to skip Sunday roast this summer.Our traditional lunch is much healthier than people realise, if you pile your plate with veg and lean meat.“It’s hard to imagine Sundays without it.

The temperature when the swim began was 16C (61F), and when I came out of the water after 79 minutes it had dropped to 12C (54F). Although our images show me swimming straight towards the rocks, the tide was actually perpendicular, pushing me 90 degrees sideways.Big up to skipper Stephen Praetorius, who navigated our craft and me safely through on the morning spring tide.I have never experienced such strong currents. It was like swimming in a flooding river.:: Day three - 9 miles (14.5km)Glassy sea on a beautiful Saturday in Mounts Bay, with a perfect spring tide current, which helped propel me toward Lizard Point.The crew continued fine-tuning the jellyfish watch and are now on a rota. It is difficult to keep focus after 20 minutes and very easy to be hypnotised by the motion of the sea and you glaze over in the glare. I have an active mind while swimming and I like to keep track of my thoughts. Occasionally I stop to shout a word or phrase for the crew to write down - something to trigger my memory later.The stream of consciousness can get quite interesting!Today was the first time we have encountered big ships - there was a row of three oil tankers anchored on the eastern end of the bay. Now heading back to Mullion Cove again, we will be heading back out in the late afternoon to pick up the GPS point for the evening swim.Overall, a phenomenal morning swim and it feels as though we are banking kilometres. All happy on board.I am back in the water this evening and hopefully this will take us to the edge of Lizard Point.This evening was all about the Lizard. Do we shoot it tonight, making the best that the spring tide can give, or do we take a measured approach and leave it for the morning?Today\u0027s swim was shorter, but fast, sometimes I was swimming at over four knots - that\u0027s 7.2 kph.Overall another happy day, as we say goodbye to Mounts Bay.:: Day two - 8 miles (12.8km) Another two good sessions in the morning and evening, in very fair conditions. I will be doing two swims a day and slingshotting around Land\u0027s End.I had a few periods of jellyfish activity - the biggest we saw was longer than our shortest crew member.Today was a day of ironing out the swim procedures. This involved working out communication between me in the water and my team, adhering to the verification protocols, working out actual distance covered versus distance swum - it\u0027s difficult to swim in an exact straight line.In total I manage to cover 6 miles (9.8km) of my journey, although this is less than the actual distance I swam.This was the first day when all nine members of the campaign were on board, and over the next few days we will learn much about the teamwork and processes that will help us get through the entire expedition.Another first today was my first jellyfish sting. It got me right on the crotch.We ended the day by sitting at anchorage just off Mousehole, finishing up dinner and getting in an early sleep before we move back to the GPS point at 4.30 am for the next swim at 6.00am. :: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both. And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I\u0027m about to embark on a swim with significant risks and consequences - financial, reputational and environmental. So there hasn\u0027t been a night in the last month that I haven\u0027t woken up.A few nights ago I was using the worry hours to plan, and remembered something Mike Tyson once said: \"Everyone\u0027s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\" I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?In those waking worry hours I also remembered the Stockdale paradox. Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead. But as English Channel crossing pioneer Captain Webb said, nothing great is ever easy.I\u0027ll keep that in mind as I strike out for Dover."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-world-cup-belgium_4362506.jpg?20180715133052 ","title":"world cup 2018 russia came out on top for crumbling myths and prejudices","story":"But it soon became clear that, for the World Cup at least, that couldn\u0027t have been further from the truth... and the England fans began to book their flights.Which meant at the world famous Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on the eve of the final, president Putin could reflect on his myth-busting efforts.He said: \"We are grateful to the millions of kind words that the guests of the tournament addressed to Russia and our people. \"We are glad that they liked its hospitality and openness, nature, culture and traditions of our big country.

Today experts shared details of their amazing discovery - after uncovering the shaft and 35 mummies in the south of Cairo in April this year. Archaeologists are hoping their big find will provide a fresh insight into the oils used by ancient Egyptians to mummify the dead. Hundreds of stone statues, jars and vessels used in the mummification process were excavated from the burial chambers. The burial shaft is thought to be more than 2,000 years old and dates back to the Saite-Persian period - around 664-404 BC.  Head of the group that uncovered the site, Badry Hussein, said: What this discovery will add are two very important things the first is the type of oils used (in mummification), and their chemical make-up. So we will be able to identify the exact types of oils used.  The most significant artefact discovered in the mission is a silver mask gilded with gold - the second of its kind found.

Business Secretary Greg Clark will announce that Sutherland, on Scotland’s north coast, has been chosen as the site for the UK’s first spaceport. It will initially host launches of space rockets and satellites, but commercial passenger travel could then follow. Mr Clark will say at this week’s Farnborough Air Show that this is the start of a “new British Space Age”. And he will add that the space flight market could be worth \u0026pound4billion to the UK economy over the next 10 years. Sutherland beat off competition from Prestwick, Ayrshire, Unst in the Shetlands and Newquay airport, Cornwall.  The spaceport will provide the infrastructure needed for space tourism, though a regulatory framework for passenger trips has yet to be created. The Space Industry Bill cleared its Commons stages in March, paving the way for the spaceport. Transport minister Jo Johnson said: “This puts us at the forefront of the new space race. It helps us to compete as the destination of choice for satellite companies worldwide.” Nearly a fifth of the UK’s space industry is based in Scotland, and Glasgow builds more satellites than any other city in Europe. A consortium submitted a proposal for Sutherland to the UK Space Agency saying the A’Mhoine peninsular was ideal for launching satellites into orbit.

Power is an aphrodisiac.” The swaggering small business minister was so sure of himself he even used his work mobile to beg Imogen and her pal for naked photos and trysts with them both. Tonight his political career was in tatters as he quit in disgrace. Theresa May saw him as a close friend and champion of women who campaigned for more female MPs. But in reality the Burton MP was little more than a slavering pervert who certainly mixed small business with his own seedy pleasure in the House of Commons.  When he wasn’t voting or in debates, he was popping out to send sordid messages from “Daddy” to the two women he had met on social media. And in between he tried to impress them by boasting about the famous and powerful people he knew. He sent one of the girls a selfie outside Buckingham Palace and shared pictures from inside, saying: “Daddy met the future king tonight: but thought of you.” On June 27, referring to himself as Daddy, he said he had been up making speeches and “running the country” but he wanted to be “licking naughty girls…” And he told one of the girls: “I’m the daddy with power. I’m the daddy with the naughtiest streak.” The MP who campaigned for upskirting to be outlawed, revealed his hypocrisy in one message to Imogen and her friend which said: “I want to be able to lift your skirts over dinner and show my friends.”  On June 20, 25 minutes after voting on the EU Withdrawal Bill, he messaged Imogen to say: “Hey… I’m good, Need distracting.” When she asked why, he replied: “Stressful day… Work work work.’ On June 26, he voted four times in Parliament on EU Trade and Partnership Agreement Orders as well as the Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill. But he still found time to send sex texts saying: “Show daddy something filthy. I think I’ve earned it.” He also managed to wire the girls \u0026pound200 for ‘treats’ remarking: “A horny daddy is a generous daddy.”  Two minutes before the last vote that day at 4.22pm he wrote: “I’m good. I thought you had forgotten daddy. And minutes later, at 4.29pm, he asked Imogen for filthy photos requesting even more explicit images, begging: “Are you going to show me?” On the morning of July 4, he told Imogen he wanted to have sex with her before going on to vote on the Ivory Bill that afternoon. When he wasn’t exhausting himself with his sordid messages he found time to keep reminding the girls of his links to power and celebrity. He sent Imogen an image of the House of Commons terrace bar at sunset and bragged about being able to provide money for the girls if they needed it, telling Imogen’s friend: “If you need money you just need to ask....it’s fine baby, tell me what you want and I will arrange something. But I’m going to need something f**king filthy to put a smile on my face first, I want to see you both naked.”  He admitted to the girls he love the way they looked and then asked: “Would you have thought I was such a naughty man?” Mr \u0026shyGriffiths bragged how his position as a former banker meant he knew singer Katherine Jenkins. He sent a series of photos of himself at ministerial engagements and top awards dinners, and bragged he had raised \u0026pound200,000 for terminally ill children at a dinner with Katie Price. In public, the MP – who lives with wife Kate and their three-month old daughter Alice in his constituency of Burton and Uttoxeter – loves to play the traditional family man. He voted against same sex marriage in 2013. He once wrote in his local paper: “For most people, their number one priority in life is looking after their family and making sure they are healthy and happy.” On another occasion when addressing how to give children the best life chances possible, he declared: “There is no better way to start that than in a loving, permanent family.” "},{"url":null,"title":"huge turnout durham miners gala","story":"NewsopinionHuge turnout for Durham Miners\u0027 Gala as more than 200,000 people throng the streetsThe brass bands and union banners celebration of North East England’s working class communities is on the scale of yesterday’s anti-Trump protest in London\u0026nbspShareByKevin MaguireAssociate editor15:26, 14 JUL 2018Updated07:45, 15 JUL 2018NewsopinionVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHuge crowds packed the medieval city of Durham today for the annual Miners’ Gala with organisers estimating upwards of 200,000.

The new dad sent Imogen Treharne and her pal \u0026pound700 and offered to rent a flat to meet for sex. He demanded explicit photos and videos and described degrading sex acts in crude detail. Small business minister Mr Griffiths, 47, today said he was “deeply shamed”, apologised for embarrassing Prime Minister Theresa May and said he would be “seeking help”. The MP, a former adviser to Mrs May, is renowned for setting up the Women To Win campaign to have more female MPs elected. He has also lambasted company chiefs for having too few women in boardrooms. But with astounding hypocrisy the MP for Burton and Uttoxeter made a string of perverted demands of barmaid Imogen, 28, and her friend.  He bombarded the girls with scores of messages virtually every day for three weeks after striking up a friendship on social media. In a string of texts Griffiths called himself “Daddy”, promised money if he received racy images and described perverted and rough sex he claimed to have had with other women. The shamed Tory wrote:  “I’m going to need something filthy to put a smile on my face. I want to see you both naked.” “Take off the bra and panties… you’ve got Daddy in such a frenzy.” “I’m going to bring you to London and do whatever I want to you.” “I’m thinking maybe we need a flat for Daddy’s girls. I’m taken by you both. You girls are spectacular.”  Many more messages go into shocking detail about his liking for certain sexual acts and are too disgusting to print in full.  The shamed MP also boasted about being powerful in politics. He claimed he was thinking about the girls as he drank champagne with Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace. He boasted abut having a friendship with opera star Katherine Jenkins. And he belittled TV star and model Katie Price, who he met at a fundraising event, saying she “looked like a cat”. Many of his texts were sent to Imogen and her friend before and after conducting important Parliamentary business.  He fired off one at 4.10pm on June 20, just 25 minutes after voting against the Government’s Brexit bill. And he gleefully boasted to the girls: “Daddy’s busy running the country.” In a statement on Saturday, the minister said: “I am deeply ashamed at my behaviour which has caused untold distress to my wife and family, to whom I owe everything, and deep embarrassment to the Prime Minister and the Government I am so proud to serve.  “I do not seek to excuse my behaviour and will be seeking professional help to ensure it never happens again.” The episode is another huge blow to the Tories, already on the ropes following the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson, endless infighting over Brexit and being made to look fools by visiting US President Donald Trump. I am deeply ashamed at my behaviour which has caused untold distress to my wife and family, to whom I owe everything, and deep embarrassment to the Prime Minister and the Government I am so proud to serve. I tendered my resignation as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Small Business on Friday night. Following discussions today (Saturday) with the Chief Whip I have referred myself to the Conservative Party’s Code of Conduct procedures. I entirely accept that pending this investigation it is right the Whip is withdrawn. I wish to apologise to my constituency association and to the people of Burton I am honoured to represent. I do not seek to excuse my behaviour and will be seeking professional help to ensure it never happens again. In time I hope to earn the forgiveness of all those who put their trust in me and that I have let down so terribly. The Prime Minister and the Government she leads will continue to have my full support."},{"url":null,"title":"saira khan its hard judge","story":"NewsopinionSaira Khan: It\u0027s so hard to judge Theresa May\u0027s Brexit fudgeWith Remainers and Brexiteers still tearing pieces out of each other, is either party actually going to come out satisfied?\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySaira Khan19:21, 14 JUL 2018NewsopinionCan Theresa May achieve a win-win with Brexit or just a major fail?

Without hesitation she replied: “No way. If I knew it was going to be this painful, costly and dragged out by a bunch of politicians who have bickered, squabbled and left people feeling uncertain and let down, I’d have voted Remain.” It’s a sentiment I feel a lot of people share. Tensions are running high and both Remainers and Brexiteers have been at full throttle as they push for a soft or hard exit. When Theresa May called a Brexit summit at \u0026shyChequers, the least we could have expected was intelligent, grown-up discussion. A “united front” was shattered in days when David Davis and Boris Johnson threw their toys out of the pram and quit. They resigned on the basis the that White Paper did not deliver a Brexit they believe in and so they could not stand by it. I’m sure they see themselves as principled. Sorry to disappoint you, chaps, I see you as weak. For those of you who don’t want to read the 104-page report, let me sum it up for you: Basically, nothing much is going to change.  For goods, we are in all but name part of the single market and will agree to EU rules and regulations – so this will please the likes of Airbus, which has threatened to quit the UK over a hard Brexit. Will we be able to undercut the EU and attract foreign trade with this deal? Donald Trump came out with mixed messages during his visit – saying this Brexit plan would “probably kill the deal” with the US, but then backtracking. So again, the hardline Brexiteers’ dream of wanting the UK to be the Singapore of Europe – with free trade, low tax and regulation – seems more than a little unlikely. Will this mean we are free from the European Court of Justice? The paper is not so clear on this, talking about a “joint committee” and “joint reference procedures”.

The Prime Minister faces her next big Commons vote tomorrow night on the Customs Bill after her new \u0027soft\u0027 Brexit plan from Chequers triggered a Tory meltdown. Brexiteer ringleader Jacob Rees Mogg has launched a bid to defeat the government on the Bill to ensure Hard Brexit. Meanwhile Remainers could also vote against Mrs May - the other way, to ensure Britain stays in a full customs union. Ahead of the split, Mrs May said she could “understand concerns” about her plans to ensure a common rulebook on goods between the UK and the EU. But she warned without it, we would be “breaking up the precious union. Facing down leadership rebels by insisting she\u0027s in it for the long term, she added: We need to keep our eyes on the prize. If we don’t, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.  Speaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr Show today, the Prime Minister admitted the rulebook was a compromise\u0027 that had been in gestation for some time. She insisted no department was cut out of these discussions and added: “I am yet to see a workable alternative. But this final claim was branded a lie by David Davis, who resigned as Brexit Secretary last week. He told the Sunday Times: “Some are saying that those on the other side have not worked out an alternative. This is an astonishingly dishonest claim.”  Mrs May admitted she had come up with the new plan because her previous ideas had been rejected as unnegotiable by the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. She told the BBC: David Davis was discussing with Michel Barnier. Michel Bernier had made clear to him the unnegotiability of the position we had, so we had a choice. “We could have said we’ll stick where we are and see what happens and risk actually ending up with a chaotic leaving, which I don’t think is in people’s interest. “Or we could have said: ‘OK let’s look at moving forward, let’s look at an alternative proposal’, which we have put forward.  Mrs May insisted her plan wouldn\u0027t rule out trade with the US, saying: It does allow us to do new trade deals around the rest of the world. But she admitted she was open to Donald Trump\u0027s demand for a carve out - special rules for the US - in a bid to secure UK-US trade. She was confronted by BBC host Andrew Marr with her own formal White Paper, which says her plan will limit the ability to change regulations. She insisted: Some of these are regulatory standards that we wouldn’t want to change anyway.  Steve Baker, who also quit as a Brexit minister, retweeted a message saying May must go last night. He accused her of presiding over a cloak and dagger plot that left Britain in a pathetic bargaining position with the EU. Specifically he accused the Prime Minister\u0027s Europe Unit, based out of the Cabinet office, of mounting a coup to wrest control of the Brexit negotiations from the Brexit Department. And he warned the Chequers Brexit plan would lead to political disaster.  I think that if we spoil and wreck Brexit, which Chequers does, then we will get Jeremy Corbyn . That would be a cataclysm he told the Sunday . The public will know they\u0027ve been betrayed. Well then what will happen to trust? Trust, I think, in democracy at that point will be blown apart. Cabinet ministers Esther McVey and Penny Mordaunt are still considering resigning, according to the Sunday Times. Even arch-remainer Lord Mandelson said Mrs May’s plan is the “polar opposite of taking back control” that would lead to “national humiliation”.  It comes after Donald Trump insisted the Chequers deal COULD allow Britain to have a trade deal with the US - after previously saying it would kill it. But in return the President demanded a carve out - in other words, special rules for the US that don\u0027t apply when the UK deals with other countries. Mrs May today admitted there could be such a carve out, saying: Carve outs are things that are done in trade deals around the world. She said other countries would want to discuss one too, saying: We’ll discuss with them in our terms”.  Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: No one - not the public, Parliament or the Conservative party - is happy with Theresa May\u0027s offer. This has descended into a shambles. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson warned Mrs May’s Brexit plan is currently “not good enough” for Labour to back it this October. He said Labour had very little confidence” in her ability to deliver and would not rule out backing a second referendum. Of the so-called ‘People’s Vote’ he said: “It seems to me that to take that off the table completely when there might be a set of circumstances where parliament cannot deliver a meaningful vote, would be a mistake, but we don\u0027t want that. Theresa May agreed a major shift to soft Brexit at her country retreat Chequers - prompting her Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to quit. The \u0027third way\u0027 plan for UK customs rules proposed keeping the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - and a possible compromise on migration. To appease Brexiteers, Parliament would keep the right to block future changes to the trading rules. But Brexiteers were enraged by this close link with Brussels and David Davis said this olive branch was meaningless in practice. The deal also proposes a common rulebook with the EU on state aid rules, and agrees to step up backup plans for a No Deal Brexit. A full White Paper was due to be published on Thursday 12 July."},{"url":null,"title":"tory mp andrew griffiths lewd","story":"NewsAndrew Griffiths\u0027 lewd and depraved text message demands to two barmaids revealedEXCLUSIVE: The married Tory minister who is MP for Burton sent 2,000 texts over three weeks after becoming pals on social media\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAlan SelbyNicola Small09:53, 15 JUL 2018Updated09:54, 15 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStunned barmaid Imogen \u0026shyTreharne has told how mucky minister Andrew Griffiths \u0026shybombarded her with lewd messages demanding sex, sex and more sex. The married Tory – who has owned up to his behaviour and resigned his post – referred to Imogen and a friend as the “ti**y twins” and suggested a string of depraved acts. He sent 2,000 texts over three weeks after becoming pals on social media. But what started as harmless flirting rapidly turned into a barrage of perverted demands. The MP sent the girls money in return for X-rated pictures and videos. He asked them to tie each other up and boasted: “I can be an evil ******* when I’m turned on.” Imogen, 28, told the Sunday Mirror: “I wanted him to be a nice guy, but by the end I felt dirty. I felt like I was being used for this wealthy man’s gratification.”  Imogen revealed how Griffiths boasted he had beaten women during sex sessions, asked her to beat her friend for his pleasure and paid them more than \u0026pound700 – asking for nude pictures and videos in return. Imogen said: “Nobody has ever sent me that many texts in the space of three weeks. Nobody I’ve not met in real life. I had to put my phone on its airplane mode because of it. “It was draining my battery. It was shocking – I wondered how he was able to send so many messages? Where was he, how did he have the freedom to do it constantly? It was as soon as he woke up and as soon as he went to bed. How did he have time to do any work?” Imogen admitted she and her friend sent 47-year-old Mr Griffiths explicit videos and accepted his money – but became turned off by his behaviour and hypocrisy. Mr Griffiths – chief of staff to PM Theresa May when the Tories were in opposition – helped set up the Women2Win group which campaigned for more female MPs.  Imogen went on: “He’s an interesting, smart guy and I tried to engage in conversation about his work. “But he’d say he found it boring and move it on to something else. He didn’t want to speak to me about anything other than sex.” His contact with Imogen and her friend – who we are not naming – began one hour after she posted a “racy” video on Snapchat at 7pm on June 16. He had been following the two women on Snapchat and \u0026shyFacebook for six months after seeing Imogen’s friend at work while out in his constituency. Instagram allows users to see who has been viewing their videos. It showed Griffiths was among the two girls’ biggest “fans” – watching them over and over again in the months before he made contact. Griffiths – whose wife Kate, 47, had their first child in April –said he wanted to use WhatsApp because he could keep her pictures to look at later. He then discussed a threesome with Imogen’s friend.  A group chat was set up on the \u0026shyFacebook Messenger service. Between the various platforms he sent more than 2,000 messages. He arranged the transfer of six payments totalling \u0026pound717 to an account used by Imogen’s friend. In return he asked for them to send him images and videos. On June 17 – the day after he first contacted Imogen – Mr \u0026shyGriffiths made reference to the fact it was Father’s Day, adding: “Daddy’s get treats. Do you think Daddy deserves a treat?” Daddy is a term used in bondage relationships. On the same day he appeared on a BBC political show. At 4.24pm he tweeted a message to followers thanking the NHS for the care they gave his daughter.  But at the same time he was messaging Imogen, asking if she was into “older men”. Then, at 4.30pm, he said his Father’s Day was going “perfectly”, before adding: “I just wish my little girl was sat on my knee. With those big t*ts in my face.” At 1am on June 22 Mr \u0026shyGriffiths boasted he had hosted a charity dinner for terminally ill children with TV celebrity Katie Price. He said: “She looks ridiculous. New facelift. Looks like a cat. But we raised \u0026pound200k for terminal kids.” On June 23, Mr Griffiths offered to rent an apartment so he could meet the girls for sex. And on June 24 he fantasised about violent sex with the girls, offering to buy matching outfits and to take them lingerie shopping. He said: “Daddy doesn’t know the prices of dresses and panties so why don’t you suggest a budget?”  The visit never took place, but the next day, amid more explicit messages, he said: “Daddy has been up making speeches and running the country. But what he really wants to be doing is ******* naughty girls’ *******.” The following day, on June 28, Burton and Uttoxeter MP Mr Griffiths sent a selfie from outside Buckingham Palace during a visit to meet Prince Charles. He also uploaded a picture of an area of the Palace not open to the public that day and told the girls: “Sadly the Queen is ill”, before adding “I think the Queen is fine, just under the weather.” One of the MP’s payments was for Imogen to buy a dress. But he wrote: “Take off the bra \u0026amp panties and I will transfer. You’ve got Daddy in such a frenzy. If you look pretty in it , I want you to wear it often. I like you to turn heads. “Make the vid and pics naughty and you can have your dress.”    “I’m going to bring you to London and do whatever I want to you.” “I’m thinking maybe we need a flat for Daddy’s girls. I’m taken by you both. You girls are spectacular.” “I’m the daddy with power. I’m the daddy with the naughtiest streak.” “I want to be able to lift your skirts over dinner and show my friends.” Sent with a selfie outside Buckingham Palace: “Daddy met the future king tonight: but thought of you.” “A horny daddy is a generous daddy.”  “If you need money you just need to ask....it’s fine baby, tell me what you want and I will arrange something. But I’m going to need something f**king filthy to put a smile on my face first, I want to see you both naked.” Would you have thought I was such a naughty man?”  "},{"url":null,"title":"alesha macphails parents thank public","story":"NewsAlesha MacPhail\u0027s parents thank public after emotional vigil to remember six-year-old daughter after tragic deathGenie Lochrane and Rab MacPhail\u0027s six-year-old daughter Alesha MacPhail, six, was found dead in woodland and it is believed she was \u0027raped and murdered\u0027\u0026nbspShareByGraham Miller16:28, 14 JUL 2018NewsMourners attended a vigil last night (Image: Dominic Cocozza)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe grief-stricken parents of tragic Alesha MacPhail were among the hundreds who attended a vigil for their daughter last night.

Kirsty Maxwell may have been trying to climb to a room below when she fell more than 100 feet from a room occupied by five British men in the resort last year. Following a dramatic reconstruction, which will air this week, experts said the 27-year-old, who was on a hen weekend with friends, was facing into the hotel room and clinging on for her life.  The shocking details contradict statements given by suspects in the case, who claimed she jumped from the 10th-floor room, the Daily Record reports .   There are just 10 feet between the 10th floor from which Kirsty fell and the next balcony down, the ninth floor, occupied by Kirsty and her friends. Kirsty’s dad Brian Curry said the family don’t believe the version of events the men, who were originally treated as suspects, have told police. He said: “We are of the opinion that it was very difficult to jump and we believe there were other factors. “The investigation wasn’t up to scratch and we need to get to the bottom of what happened. We are Kirsty’s voice. We are doing this for her.”  Kirsty was on a hen weekend and is believed to have been looking for her friends when she entered a room used by Joseph Graham, Ricky Gammon, Anthony Holehouse, Callum Northridge and Daniel Bailey – all from the Nottingham area. Spanish police believe Kirsty, who married husband Adam in 2016, may have mistaken the apartment for a friend’s flat and become disorientated. She fell from the balcony of room 10E at Apartamentos Payma in the early hours of the morning of April 29, 2017. In the forthcoming programme, Killed Abroad, retired detective David Swindle asks if some of the accused men could have intervened to save Lloyd’s TSB worker Kirsty’s life in the time it took for her to climb over the balcony.  In a reconstruction of the balcony from room 10E, three women of similar height and weight as Kirsty and wearing the same clothes try to jump on to the makeshift frame. Swindle concludes: “She could not have jumped directly over that balcony. It seems far more likely she clambered over. But what happened next? It makes me wonder – has Kirsty been climbing? Was she trying to get to the rooms below? “It wasn’t very quick. What were they (the suspects) doing when this was going on. We saw how difficult it is to do what was said that Kirsty did.” Swindle added that everyone in the apartment was aware Kirsty was in the room and was upset. He said: “There was plenty of time for someone to intervene and save Kirsty’s life. “All of this evidence was available to police over a year ago and it appears Kirsty was facing back into the room before she fell. Was she climbing down before she somehow lost her grip? These are questions I’ll try to answer in the coming months.”  The programme also features fall expert Michael Brown, who reviews police photos to try to piece together Kirsty’s final moments. He backs up a theory that she was facing back into the room at the time she fell. He said: “All we can say is I believe she was facing into the room at the point she lost her balance or lost her grip and fell, vertically initially, before she interacted with features on the building. How that loss of balance or loss of grip occurred is not something I can hypothesise on.”  The potential breakthrough came with Kirsty’s parents, husband and friends in a race against time to find fresh evidence to keep the case open. In the programme, the investigating team are also able to pick major holes in the statements given by the suspects. Graham, who had also made his way to room 10E from a neighbouring bedroom, believed Kirsty was a sex worker who had been in his room with his friend.  She is believed to have gone to the bathroom first and attempted to climb out a window. At one point, Graham was heard shouting, “You’re in the wrong room,” and later says: “F***, she jumped.” Another suspect claimed he heard Graham say: “There’s someone on the ground below.” Graham denied being on the balcony but suspect Northridge claimed he was “with the girl when he said she jumped”. Meanwhile, Kirsty’s family are still struggling to come to terms with her loss and are frustrated at the lack of help available to families who feel abandoned by the authorities. Brian said: “We were abandoned and we have had to find our own way. “Every day is difficult and there are reminders every day. Just little things, it can be anywhere, like music. Kirsty loved music and Mumford \u0026amp Sons. “We are focused on Kirsty and the case and we want to highlight it as much as we can. We owe it to Kirsty.”  He said the family are liaising with the British Consul with a view to appointing a new legal representative for the family after losing their lawyer earlier this year. A Spanish judge has already warned she is waiting to see if tests on samples taken from Kirsty contain any of the men’s DNA “to conclude her investigation”. If it is closed, Kirsty’s family could appeal to a higher court. Brian said they are hoping the new documentary will keep Kirsty’s case highlighted as they try to get justice. He added: “We hope this will put pressure on the authorities to take this to trial. We are waiting for scientific results back from the lab and a prosecutor will look at the evidence. “We want somebody to be held responsible. To me, one or more people are responsible for Kirsty’s death.”  Kirsty’s husband Adam recently gave evidence to an all-party parliamentary group at Westminster about his wife’s death, which was chaired by SNP MP Hannah Bardell.   He said: “In hindsight, I would have expected the authorities to do a lot more. What we would consider as a standard protocol in the UK, it’s almost as if that doesn’t exist in Kirsty’s case. “I would like the consular services to have a bit more clout and impact to help a family like ours. Another family will experience something like this again.” Bardell added: “In Kirsty’s case, the investigation is completely inadequate. Our citizens are being abandoned at the most difficult time in their lives.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lovestruck man who tracked down","story":"NewsLovestruck man who tracked down \u0027his Vicky Pattison\u0027 he met on holiday after online plea has a WIFEGarry Guest managed to track down the woman he fancied, Marie Donnelly, after meeting her on lads\u0027 holiday in Portugal\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLisa HutchinsonReporter13:05, 15 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A lovestruck man who tracked down a woman he met on a lads\u0027 holiday to Portugal is actually married , it has been revealed.  Gary Guest could not stop thinking about the woman - he knew her only as Marie - he met in a bar in Albufeira. And when he returned to his home in Nottingham he put out an appeal to help him find his “princess”.  Within hours of us putting his plea online to search for the woman of his dreams, our army of readers helped track down Marie Donnelly who admitted she was “very flattered”, reports Chronicle Live .   But after the couple messaged each other and Gary had asked the 29-year-old if he could meet her in Newcastle, shocked Marie then received a message on Facebook from Gary’s other half Heather saying “Romeo has got a wife”.   “I couldn’t believe it,” said Marie, of Gateshead. “After Gary did what he did to find me, I was very flattered. He kept messaging me and he asked if he could come up to Newcastle to see me. I didn’t want to meet up with him straight away as I didn’t know much about him but then after our story appeared in the media I got a message from his wife saying ‘Do you know Romeo has got a wife?’ “I then messaged Gary and said we had better leave it at that. “Gary messaged me saying he wanted to meet up so he could tell me in person that he was separated. He said he wanted to tell me in person before social media did but that looks as though it had beaten him to it.  “All my friends thought it was funny and I suppose it is one of those stories I will be telling for years to come,” added Marie, who works in public relations - and is single. Gary only had Marie’s first name when he set about his search. Unable to trawl through the thousands of Maries on social media, he asked his local newspaper, the Chronicle, to help find the right Marie. And within hours, Gary was put in touch with the woman he’d been dreaming about. Gary was sitting in Sir Harry’s bar in the Old Town Square in Albufeira with his friends on Tuesday, June 19, at around 11pm when Marie walked in. The 42-year-old couldn’t take his eyes off her and asked to buy her a drink via the waitress. Gary then took the drink over to her and said ‘that is for a beautiful princess’.  Marie then thanked him and kissed him on the cheek. The guys asked her name and she told them she was Marie from the North East. Gary, a section foreman on the HS2 rail link, said ‘you can be my Vicky Pattison’ and she said ‘I CAN be your Vicky Pattison’. Marie sat back down and then, about 10 minutes later she got up from their table and left. Gary jumped up to give her one last kiss on the cheek and Marie walked away into the distance. At the time Gary said: “Like a fool, I let her go.” But now Gary has changed his tune and admitted he was still living in the same house as his wife but for the past two years claimed they had been living separate lives.

Thomas Markle believes the life of being a royal is piling the pressure on his daughter. He told The Sun that the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s smile is \u0027pained\u0027. Thomas, 73, said: “My thing about my daughter right now is that I think she is terrified. “I see it in her eyes, I see it in her face and I see it in her smile. “I’ve seen her smile for years. I know her smile. I don’t like the one I’m seeing now. This one isn’t even a stage smile – this is a pained smile.   Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton giggle together during girls day out at Wimbledon to watch Serena Williams\u0027 singles final  He added that he was worried the former Suits actress was under too much pressure and that he was \u0027bemused\u0027 by the royal dress code. Thomas Sr, who turns 74 next week, fears he may not have long to live due following his cardiac arrest and heart surgery. He has never met his son in law and has not seen Meghan since she got married in Windsor Castle in May. Thomas claims the phone he used to call Meghan is no longer picking up and a staff member at Kensington Palace has not responded to his texts.  His despair comes after he failed to attend the royal wedding in May.   He suffered heart palpitations and had emergency surgery shortly after being exposed for faking paparazzi pictures for cash.  He then appeared on Good Morning Britain earlier this month and broke royal protocol by revealing his new son-in-law’s views on Brexit and Donald Trump.  A source told the Mirror: “Thomas is heartbroken. He is at a complete loss as to why he has been excluded.”  Thomas, 73, has been telling friends: “I haven’t talked to Meghan and Harry for a long time. I think they’re shot of me now.” Mr Markle fears Megan will never visit him in Mexico, saying: “I don’t know if she’ll visit. I told her not to come and visit when I was in hospital. I think that relationship is lost now.” Just weeks ago, Thomas voiced his irritation Donald Trump will meet the Queen next week before he has had the chance to. He said: “If the Queen is willing to meet our arrogant, ignorant, and insensitive president she has no excuse not to meet me, I’m nowhere near as bad.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents united grief over child","story":"NewsParents whose children drowned unite in grief to spare heartbreak for other familiesAs the summer heatwave ­continues to lure youngsters into rivers, lakes, reservoirs and the sea, they are pleading for action\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByVikki WhiteGrace Macaskill 21:12, 14 JUL 2018Updated22:23, 14 JUL 2018News(Left to right) Beckie Ramsay, Fiona Gosling, Natalie Lawson and Mark Scaife (Image: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThese four \u0026shyparents are united by grief – and a \u0026shydetermination to spare other \u0026shyfamilies \u0026shythe same heartbreak. Each one is enduring the agony of losing a child to drowning. And as the summer heatwave \u0026shycontinues to lure youngsters into rivers, lakes, reservoirs and the sea, they are \u0026shypleading for action. The parents – Rebecca Ramsay, Fiona Gosling, Natalie Lawson and Mark Scaife – want children taught open water safety lessons as part of the \u0026shynational curriculum. More than 400 people drown in Britain every year, according to the Royal Life Saving Society. For Rebecca, 39, tragedy struck seven years ago when her 13-year-old son Dylan went for a dip with pals. She will never forget his last words to her before his fateful trip to a \u0026shywater-filled quarry in Whittle-le-Woods, Lancashire. He had been sleeping over at a friend’s and in a phone call asked her to wish his 11-year-old brother Stephen good luck in a football tournament.  Rebecca, of Chorley, Lancs, said: “It was just an ordinary day. I called him in the morning to tell him to come home for 11am and clean his room, which was a real mess. “How could I have known that was the last time we’d ever speak? He just went for a little bit of fun in the \u0026shysunshine and it cost him his life.” Within days of Dylan’s death Rebecca began campaigning about the dangers of open water swimming. She has given talks to about 3,000 pupils around the UK and believes kids must be able to swim 25 metres by secondary school. She also thinks they should only swim where there are lifeguards and the Government ought to provide money for drowning prevention. Rebecca is also keen to raise \u0026shyawareness of cold water shock which played a part in Dylan’s death. It can trigger involuntary inhalation which, if under water, can lead to drowning and cause heart attacks. In June last year, Natalie’s 16-year-old son Paul died in Greenbooth Reservoir in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Rebecca reached out to her with a message on Facebook.  Natalie, 37, said: “I got a note saying ‘I truly understand how you are \u0026shyfeeling.’ and I knew she did. “Rebecca has been an incredible support and I just don’t know how I’d have got through without that \u0026shyfriendship.” Natalie had begged Paul, an aspiring footballer, not to swim at the popular beauty spot. She said: “I told him waters like that were dangerous. He didn’t listen.” “I found out my son had died when I got text messages asking if it was true he had drowned. “Later, I had to sit down my nine-year-old daughter Charlotte and tell her her brother was never coming home. She just broke down. No parent should ever have to do that.”  At his inquest, Paul’s friends told of their desperate attempts to save him. One said: “He didn’t seem to be \u0026shymoving. He looked a bit blue. His head kept going under. “I grabbed Paul. I tried so hard to keep hold of him. I was \u0026shyscreaming for help but I had to get out because I was just so tired.” Natalie said: “God knows what his friends went through. I strongly believe if children were more aware of the dangers they might think twice. “I don’t want any other families to go through what I have. I’d urge \u0026shyparents not to take anything for granted, especially their children. “One day you wake up happy as usual and the next your whole life has been turned upside down.” Like Rebecca, Fiona, 39, of Crook, Co Durham, talks to school kids about her dead son. Cameron, 14, was a strong swimmer but died of cold water shock after jumping into the River Wear near Bishop Auckland in July 2015. He shouted to friends for help but they could not save him. It took divers took seven hours to find his body. Fiona heard Cameron was \u0026shymissing in a text from her son Curtis, then 12, who was out with his big brother. She said: “He texted that Cameron had jumped into the river and hadn’t come back up. “I started to panic and drove straight there. I didn’t know how to get to the site and ended up parking miles away. “I started to walk down and met Curtis. His face just said it all.” Fiona, now working with the Royal Life Saving Society, believes educating children about the risks of open water swimming could save lives. She said: “I’ve relived Cameron’s story to 10,000 kids in different schools and it very often provokes a few tears. I’ve seen grown men crying.” Talking at Salford Quays, where young boys were seen jumping into the water last week, Rebecca said: “My message is – No lifeguard, no swimming. It’s not worth the risk.” Recently, a couple who have lost their son phoned her. She said: “They want you to tell them that everything’s going to be OK. I say, ‘It’s not going to get better but I’m here for you and I know what you’re going through.’”  Shoulder to shoulder with the three mums is Mark, whose son Michael, 20, died in August 2015 after jumping into the Jubilee River in Berkshire. He had been celebrating the end of a Prince’s Trust course with three pals.  Mark, of Langley, Berks, said Michael had rescued a friend but he was unable to save himself. He said: “Michael’s friends have to live with the memory of this forever and that’s a terrible thing. It wasn’t their fault.” The tragedy hit Mark’s youngest child Lily, just seven at the time, \u0026shyespecially hard. She needed \u0026shycounselling to cope with the loss. Mark said: “We’ll never forget Michael, we talk about him all the time.” Salford and Trafford fire chief Paul Duggan praised the parents for their safety campaign. He said: “Sadly, open water is a magnet for \u0026shypeople during the summer. People see it as \u0026shysomewhere they can cool off. But they don’t see the danger.” The Royal Life Saving Society UK gives 12 tips to reduce the risks of swimming in open waters. ■ Always look for warning and guidance signs. ■ Swim parallel with the shore, not away from it. Avoid drifting in the currents. ■ Do not enter fast- flowing water. ■ Be aware of underwater hazards. ■ Get out of the water as soon as you start to feel cold. ■ Never enter the water after consuming alcohol. ■ Only enter the water in areas with adequate supervision and rescue cover. ■ Always take someone with you when you go into or near water. If something goes wrong they will be able to get help. ■ If someone is in difficulty in the water shout reassurance to them and shout for help and phone the emergency services – call 999 or 112. ■ Without endangering yourself, see if you can reach out to them with a stick, pole or item of clothing – lie down to ensure you stay secure. Or throw something buoyant such as a ring buoy or anything that will float. ■ Always let someone know where you’re going – take your mobile phone. ■ Learn swimming and life-saving skills.

But some angry customers have woken up to find the famous cash-back pledge is no longer what it seems. Rather than being handed the cost of their stay by staff at the reception, guests need to go online and fill out a complaint form to try to claw back cash. Industry insiders believe the Good Night Guarantee campaign, introduced in 2012, was quietly revised after Premier Inn was inundated with claims from people wanting a freebie. One said: “No longer do they offer on-site refunds if you haven’t enjoyed your stay. They changed their policy as they were getting a pounding from people taking advantage of the system.”  Martyn James, of customer complaints website Resolver, said: “Never undersell or over-promise, as the old advertising industry adage goes. “You can bet the bosses at Premier Inn have turned a distinct shade of purple after their ‘good night’s sleep’ promise became a ticket to a free night. While it’s admirable that the deal lasted this long, don’t expect any easy freebies in future now the firm has toughened up its rules.” Premier Inn, one of Britain’s biggest chains, with 750 hotels, says it moved to a centralised refunds system last year to make the way it handles customer claims “as consistent, professional and simple as possible”.

The three posed up yesterday for a snap inside the grand corridor of Windsor Castle in a historic moment, but the right hand corner of the picture featured a dog bowl. The inclusion shows that it\u0027s the Queen\u0027s home as well as being used for royal functions. And the bowl is believed to be used by Her Majesty\u0027s two \u0027dorgis\u0027 (dachshund-corgi crosses), Vulcan and Candy, the Daily Mail reports. The trio smiled as they stood up straight with their hands by their sides, the Queen dressed in a sky blue while Melania wore a cream Dior suit. In a photo in the same spot today of the Queen meeting King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium however, the dog bowl appeared to have disappeared. Royal staff seemed to have subtly removed it in time for the formal photograph this afternoon.  It was the first time the Belgian royal couple met the Queen in an official capacity since their accession to the throne, according to the royalwatcherblog. And Trump finally enjoyed having tea with the Queen yesterday inside the castle. The US president was criticised on social media for not bowing as he shook hands briefly with the Queen on the dais, and First Lady Melania Trump did not curtsy as she shook the head of state\u0027s white gloved hand when they met.  But eagle-eyed viewers have spotted Trump did in fact give a subtle bow of his head when he stepped out his Range Rover and locked eyes with the Queen. The monarch smiled broadly and shared a few words with the Trumps before indicating they should stand either side of her for the military band\u0027s rendition of the American national anthem.  She presented members of the Royal household to her guests before guiding Mr and Mrs Trump through the Sovereign\u0027s entrance for their afternoon tea. They were seated in the castle\u0027s Oak Room, where in 2016 the Queen hosted then US president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle. To accompany the tea they also had sandwiches and scones.

The mother of Amira Abase, who was just 15 when she fled the UK in 2015, reportedly fears her daughter died almost a year ago. Mum Fetia Hussen says she lost the mobile phone app communication she had with Amira last summer. She was also reportedly told by informed sources that her daughter is believed to be dead, according to the Mail on Sunday.  Amira is the second of the \u0027Bethnal Green jihadi brides\u0027 feared to have been killed. She and pals Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum left their families in east London during the Easter school holidays more than three years ago. Kadiza, 17, is thought to have died after her home in Raqqa was targeted by a Russian airstrike. She was believed to be the first British female killed in the so-called caliphate. The teenager had reportedly become disillusioned with life in the terror state and was making plans to flee back to Britain.  The trio became some of Britain\u0027s most infamous ISIS recruits and shocked the nation after leaving their A-Level courses and their families to marry fighters in Syria. Kadiza\u0027s family were hoping to help to get her out of Raqqa and across the border into Turkey. But it is believed she was killed before she could flee, after the property she was staying in was obliterated by the airstrike in May 2016.  Kadiza\u0027s sister, Halima Khanom told ITV during the tense months when the desperate family hoped to secure her return to the UK: Things have changed. The way she used to communicate with me. The way she used to talk about things has totally changed. Up until now. She\u0027s scared of being there.”  Within the interview are recordings of phone calls between Halima and her younger sister before her death. Kadiza tells her sister “I don’t have a good feeling. I feel scared. “You know the borders are closed right now, so how am I going to get out? I am not going to go through PKK [Kurdish forces inside Syria] territory to come out, I am never going to do that, ever.” Later Halima asks: “How confident are you feeling in terms of getting out?” Khadiza: “Zero….. Where is Mum? I want to speak to her.” Speaking straight after the phone call Halima said: “She sounds very terrified. She did get very emotional there as well. It feels…I feel really helpless. What can I do? It’s really hard. I don’t think she’s ever made a choice by herself. That was the first one and a very big one. I just look forward to the next call and that’s what keeps me going.” It is believed the teenager was inside a residential building when it was struck by the airstrike.  Speaking in 2016 following news of her sister\u0027s death, Halima said: We were expecting this in a way. But at least we know she is in a better place. We do not wish her name to come up in the headlines again. She is gone and we would like to respect her wishes. The families of all three Bethnal Green schoolgirls made headlines in February 2015 after making a series of desperate public appeals for information on the missing teenagers. It is believed that all three wed fellow foreigners who were fighting for the Islamic State. Khadiza\u0027s husband was an American national of Somali origin who died late last year. All three families were represented at the time of the schoolgirls\u0027 disappearance by lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, who said: Leaving ISIS is like trying to escape from Alcatraz, with a shoot to kill order added in. It\u0027s devastating for the family that it ended like this. Perhaps the only benefit out of this is as a tombstone and a testimony for others of the risks of actually going to a warzone, to dissuade people from ever making that choice.

Driving instructor David Braham, from Bridgend in Wales, has been diagnosed with the rare autoimmune condition Guillain-Barr\u0026eacute syndrome and can no longer walk, talk or breathe on his own.  The gym enthusiast was struck down with the illness just days after complaining of a dodgy stomach while watching his six-year-old son Junior play rugby at the Liberty Stadium in Swansea on April 6. A couple of days later he started to feel pins and needles spread from his hands and feet, leaving him unable to walk.   David\u0027s sister Rhianne told Wales Online : It started with him having food poisoning. My nephew was playing rugby and he said his stomach was feeling dodgy. We just put it down to a 24 hour bug and said to go to the doctor.  That day he was fine, there was nothing wrong. He went to work, met up with my nephew, met with the team and went on the minibus to the Liberty Stadium. But after receiving antibiotics from his GP, David\u0027s condition started to deteriorate. Four days after the match, the 40-year-old went to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend complaining of pins and needs. A week later he was re-admitted, this time to the intensive care unit. Rhianne, 31, said: They gave him antibiotics but because he couldn\u0027t keep anything down he had to go to hospital. On the Saturday he started having pins and needles. He phoned me and said \u0027I\u0027m dying\u0027 and I just told him he was being a drama queen. I feel bad now, he couldn\u0027t get out of bed. He was using my mother\u0027s zimmer frame, he just couldn\u0027t walk. Me and my father had to lift him onto the sofa. The pins and needles worked its way through his body. They couldn’t stop it, it was just a case of waiting to see how high it would reach. On Tuesday he went to the ICU early morning and by Thursday he was put in an induced coma.  Over 48 hours he couldn’t move anything. His fingers were like a corpse to touch, they were so cold. When they put him in a coma they fitted him with a tracheotomy which has been there to this day which has been three months. As well as needing assistance to breathe, David has been left relying on a voice box to help him talk. He has now been transferred to a specialist unit at Llandough Hospital in Cardiff to help with his rehabilitation. Rhianne said: He\u0027s lost four and a half stone, he was quite muscly and big and he\u0027s gone to bone. He spent his 40th birthday in hospital. Their main target is to get him off the ventilator and eating. Then it will be a case of possibly moving him to a rehabilitation centre as he will have to learn to walk again and write again - everything we do he will have to learn again. They say it will take about 12 to 18 months for him to work again. David\u0027s goal is to arrive home by his son\u0027s seventh birthday in November, but the Welsh family face a longer journey ahead to help him reach his target. Rhianne said: It\u0027s been hard. He has children and a lot of the time they were constantly asking when daddy is coming home.

Thomas Markle is said to be “heartbroken” at his growing estrangement from daughter Meghan since missing her fairytale wedding to Harry.  The Duchess of Sussex’s ailing dad believes he may never see daughter Meghan again because the royal couple are shot of him.  Thomas Sr, who turns 74 next week, fears he may not have long to live due following his cardiac arrest and heart surgery.   He told The Sun on Sunday : “I had a heart attack, doesn’t anybody care? I could actually die soon.  Does she want this to be the last thing we’ve said to each other?” Thomas claims the phone he used to call Meghan is no longer picking up and a staff member at Kensington Palace has not responded to his texts.  His despair comes after he failed to attend the royal wedding in May.   He suffered heart palpitations and had emergency surgery shortly after being exposed for faking paparazzi pictures for cash.  He then appeared on Good Morning Britain earlier this month and broke royal protocol by revealing his new son-in-law’s views on Brexit and Donald Trump.  A source told the Mirror earlier this month: “Thomas is heartbroken. He is at a complete loss as to why he has been excluded.”  Thomas, 73, has been telling friends: “I haven’t talked to Meghan and Harry for a long time. I think they’re shot of me now.” Mr Markle fears Megan will never visit him in Mexico, saying: “I don’t know if she’ll visit. I told her not to come and visit when I was in hospital. I think that relationship is lost now.” Just weeks ago, Thomas voiced his irritation Donald Trump will meet the Queen next week before he has had the chance to. He said: “If the Queen is willing to meet our arrogant, ignorant, and insensitive president she has no excuse not to meet me, I’m nowhere near as bad.” "},{"url":null,"title":"papa johns pizza founder resigns","story":"NewsPapa John\u0027s pizza founder resigns after being caught using the n-word - but claims it wasn\u0027t a racial slurFounder and former CEO John Schnatter used the derogatory word on a conference call during a training session\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNatalie Evans07:01, 15 JUL 2018Updated07:05, 15 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The face of Papa John\u0027s pizza has resigned after he was caught using the n-word.  Founder and former CEO John Schnatter stepped down as chairman of the board following a backlash over his use of the racial slur during a conference call. The resignation comes after Forbes reported that Schnatter used an offensive term with a marketing agency during a media training session on race. On the call, Schnatter - who was forced to step down as CEO in January - was trying to downplay his earlier comments that the NFL\u0027s handling of national anthem protests had led to weak pizza sales.  Schnatter, who founded the company in 1984, also came under fire in November after he criticised the NFL\u0027s leadership over the player protests. He complained that Colonel Sanders had said much worse in the past without facing a public backlash. Schnatter also reportedly recalled growing up in Indiana, where he said people used to drag African Americans from their trucks until they died. Forbes saying the comments were intended to demonstrate his position against racism, but people on the call were offended.  On Wednesday, the company went into damage control, issuing a statement saying: Papa John\u0027s condemns racism and any insensitive language, no matter the situation or setting. Schnatter confirmed the allegations in a statement to Forbes and said: Regardless of the context, I apologise. In a subsequent interview, Schnatter said it was NOT a slur, because it was during a training session. He sadi: It wasn\u0027t a slur. It was a social strategy and media planning and training and I repeated something that somebody else said and said, \u0027we\u0027re not going to say that, We don\u0027t use that kind of language or vocabulary.\u0027 And sure it got taken out of context, and sure it got twisted, but that doesn\u0027t matter. I hurt people\u0027s feelings. That\u0027s what matters here. And for that, I\u0027m sorry and I\u0027m disappointed in myself that something like that could happen.

At first, the smell was overwhelming. But she quickly got used to it and the weight. She had to, she decided – because this was a grim task that desperately needed doing and no one else was doing it. After last year’s celebration of the liberation of Mosul, Iraq’s second biggest city, the devastation of its residents as well as its buildings was painfully clear to see. When we meet 12 months on within the streets lined with shattered ruins, the stench of rotting bodies is unmistakable.  Boys, some as young as five, are so hardened by war they tell me they play a macabre game of setting light to the corpses of IS fighters. An estimated 40,000 people – fighters on both sides and civilians – died in eight months of street battles, artillery duels and airstrikes. Thousands of corpses, including IS fanatics with explosives still strapped to them, lay where they had fallen under vast piles of debris. When the authorities did nothing to remove them Suroor, a 23-year-old nurse, decided she must. Partly out of fear of disease. But mostly in a determined attempt to restore some dignity to the dead. Suroor was spurred into action after her sister Nibras, 14, was killed and her dad died of a heart attack in the city’s old town.  She could not bear the idea of unburied bodies being left to fester in the unrelenting 49\u0026degC heat. So last November she began her campaign to retrieve the city’s dead with a small group of six, including her supportive husband. She was the only woman to start with but others soon came forward as her group swelled to 30. Since then Suroor has personally cleared 1,350 bodies, many of which she had to disarm first. She says: “Every person I collected, especially when they were children, I thought of my sister. “Of course the smell was strong. We needed to carry the bodies, sometimes they were heavy and they split. But I got used to it, it did not scare me. “Some bodies had explosives around them and I would ask my team to move back. I disarmed them myself.  “The civilians were taken to the mortuary. No one knows where they take IS bodies.” Once Suroor came upon a room with 150 corpses piled high, every one shot in the head. She said: “For months we were the only ones doing this. It just needed to be done. I do think my sister would be proud of me.” As the conflict entered its last stages in 2017 Suroor and her husband fled to east Mosul, which had already been liberated. The rest of her family were set to join them but then their house was hit by a missile. Suroor, her face softening for a moment, recalled: “My brother, his wife and son were injured. But the missile directly hit my sister. Her brain came out. “She was my only sister. She was just a teenage student going to school, I used to take her. We used to go shopping.” The family were trapped in the rubble for hours before being pulled out by neighbours. Suroor took seven hours to make her way through the fighting to get to them.  At that time people were being forced to bury loved ones in parks and gardens. But Suroor bargained with security teams to get her sister’s body transferred to east Mosul for burial in a cemetery. Nibras became the first body to be taken across, and the deal was only done because Suroor agreed to help treat Iraqi army wounded. Under three years of IS occupation Suroor regularly got into arguments with the fanatics, who banned her from running her own medical centre. Before her father died he told her the work she was doing to treat the injured was the best revenge. And she felt the same about collecting bodies. She went to one official organisation after another to get them to do it but all came up with reasons not to. So that’s when she offered to help, and has been doing until just a few weeks ago when Mosul’s governor finally stopped her.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

The total in 2016 was 191.However, it’s still some way off from the 218 birds that were destroyed by council workers in 2014.Birds are terminated by council staff where required by exercising rights under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.They will often target nests and gulls during the peak of the breeding season, which runs from April until the end of July.The law usually forbids the destruction of protected species, including gulls.However, a spokesman for the council said exceptions can be made when there is a risk to public safety.The spokesman added: “Dundee City Council does not undertake ‘culls’ of gulls.“Any actions taken are in accordance with the general licence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.“This allows for the destruction of birds under certain circumstances, but this is only permissible where it can be demonstrated that they pose a risk to public safety or health, and only when all other non-lethal methods of control have been investigated and discounted.“Pest control officers are also actively involved in removing eggs and nests throughout the breeding season, which is approximately April to July.“This action greatly reduces the incidences of aggressive behaviour as well as the consequence of disrupting and reducing the breeding pattern.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/GOLF-Open-Overview-063444.jpg-879x564.jpg ","title":"huge boost for local economy as 170000 folk descend on tayside for the open","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTayside\u0026#8217s restaurants, bars, hotels and guest houses are preparing for an influx of tens of thousands of golf fans from across the world from this weekend.Carnoustie will host the 147th staging of The Open Championship, welcoming all the sport’s top stars and their legions of supporters to the area.The event – which holds its first practice day on Sunday, before the competition proper gets under way on Thursday – is expected to attract more than 170,000 spectators.And it’s anticipated they will plough £70 million into the local economy as they visit venues across the region to keep well fed and watered.Golfers are expected to start jetting in over the next few days, with Dundee Airport playing host to their private jets as well as flights chartered specially for fans.Airport manager Derrick Lang said: “We have extensive experience in dealing with golfing events on a similar scale, from the likes of the yearly pro-am Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, past Open Championships in the area and the Ryder Cup held at Gleneagles in 2014.“For The Open this year, we estimate that we will service about 80-100 aircraft movements throughout the tournament week.”Craig Lafferty, Business Angus officer at Angus Council, said the championship would provide the perfect opportunity to showcase what the region has to offer.He said: “The focus will be on promoting Carnoustie Country as a great place to play, stay, eat and explore.“We have promoted commercial opportunities to local businesses, including providing details of local food and drink and suppliers to The R\u0026ampA.“We are working to ensure that the town has a festival atmosphere, is welcoming and encourages our visitors to enjoy their visit and hopefully return.”At the tournament itself, local food and drink will be showcased. Local producers will be offering some of their wares from Tuesday to Sunday.Award-winning chef Adam Newth, of the Michelin-recommended Tayberry restaurant in Broughty Ferry, is set to cater for celebrities and former golfers at the after party – which is a first for The Open.Adam, 27, who was crowned Young Scottish Chef of the Year and Young Scottish Seafood Chef of the Year in 2016, will be providing a luxury oyster bar containing hundreds of molluscs for the 500 guests in attendance.He said: “I’ve learned from some of the country’s finest Michelin-starred chefs, including Tom Kitchin and Martin Wishart, so I’m looking forward to showcasing my skills and the very best of Scottish produce to the golfing elite, TV personalities and Hollywood producers.”Organisers of the event have encouraged those driving to the venue to follow designated routes to the public car parks, which will be signed by the AA.However, fans can also use public transport to access the course – with extra trains being laid on by ScotRail for the duration of the championship.Services between Dundee and Carnoustie will run as frequently as every 10-15 minutes, with regular trains from various parts of Fife, Perthshire and Angus also serving the town. Full timetables for services are available on The Open and ScotRail websites.Meanwhile, Stagecoach – which already runs services through Carnoustie from Dundee and other parts of Angus – will be running additional services at peak times, with demand expected to be high.There will also be a designated bicycle park near the course, accessed via National Cycle Route 1 and by following the signs on approach to Carnoustie Golf Links.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b487e1ac8223-834x564.jpg ","title":"new boy callum booth likes the way new look dundee united are gelling","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt will be a new-look Dundee United team that even most of their own fans won’t recognise when the Betfred Cup kicks off with a group-stage tie against Arbroath at Tannadice today.The Tangerines could field eight of their nine new summer signings and, so far, the only chance Arabs have had to see them in action was in the friendly victory up at Brechin City early last week.United impressed that night but the two build-up games since against Raith Rovers and then Cowdenbeath took place in private at their St Andrews training base.One of the new boys who’ll be on show, Callum Booth, reports the encouraging signs of the Brechin run out continued in those two closed-door affairs.And while he’s conscious the best time to judge any team is when the competitive action starts, he’s not been surprised by the fact things seem to be coming together at pace.“I think it’s a case of if you sign good players they will click quickly. That’s what we’ve done and I’ve been impressed by the boys in training and these friendlies,” said the 27-year-old full-back.“Quite a few of the boys who’ve been brought in also have good experience of Scottish football. They know what to expect and have fitted in.“On top of that we’ve done a lot of hard work in the three-and-a-bit weeks since pre-season training. As usual there’s been a lot of fitness stuff and I’m experienced enough to know you need to put that work in to make sure you’re not hit by injuries and niggles during a season.“But we’ve also done a lot of tactical stuff.“The manager (Csaba Laszlo) is very big on that side of things and the training has been good.“As good as it’s looked, we know the real test comes with the competitive stuff and we’re looking forward to that starting against Arbroath.“It will be a good test. I know a few of the boys there and they had a very good season last year, so they’ll be looking forward to coming to Tannadice and trying to get a good start to their season.”This will also be former Hibs and Partick Thistle man Booth’s first home game as a United player and he admits the chance to turn out at Tannadice on a regular basis was a factor in his decision to sign up on a two-year deal last month.“I’ve played there a few times down the years and it’s a great stadium,” he added.“Add that to the training facility over in St Andrews, which is brilliant, and it was definitely one of the reasons I was delighted to join United.”When he decided to end his three-year stint with Patrick at the end of last term, it was widely expected Booth would stay in the Premiership. Several top-flight clubs were credited with a strong interest and it was something of a surprise when he opted for the Dundee United option.He admits stepping down to the Championship with United was something he had to think long and hard about.Ultimately, he believes while in terms of division he’s taking a temporary step down, in the longer term it’s going to prove to be a case of onwards and upwards.“It was a big decision but once I thought it through I knew it was the right one.“I’ve got a bit of experience now but at 27 I, hopefully, still have a few years left and I should be coming into my prime.“When I look at the potential at this club, I know where it can go and, hopefully, I will be back playing in the Premiership before too long.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/SNS-15161464-Dundee-UTD-Photocall.jpg-904x564.jpg ","title":"non stop ringing in luggys ears as players come calling for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRebuilding the squad at Dundee United has made for a hectic summer – just a glance at the list of calls received on Paul Sturrock’s phone tells you that.The Tangerines legend and current chief scout has revealed over the past couple of months there have been days he’s taken over 100 calls from agents of players on the club’s list of possible signing targets.But he’s hoping the next 10 months will show the hard graft he, manager Csaba Laszlo and the other members of the back-room staff have put in has been worth it.To date, those calls have resulted in nine new signings and as many as four more are still planned.After missing out on promotion back to the Premiership for the past two years, the feeling was those kind of numbers were necessary to make sure United get it right this time.And “Luggy” believes, starting with today’s Betfred Cup kick-off against Arbroath, the fans will see they’ve at last got a team capable of doing the required job.“It has been a very busy summer for the manager, myself and a few others. There have been days when the phone’s rang over a 100 times but that’s what happens when you make the slight changes we’ve made,” he joked.“It really started right after we lost to Livingston in the play-offs and we’ve been going ever since.“I know the manager is happy with the nine players he’s got so far and there are a few more we’d like and don’t forget the back-room staff have also been reshuffled.”And it’s not just been about identifying talent – making sure players have the right character and are capable of handling the rigours of the second tier has been important, too.“In a lot of ways it’s not finding players with talent that’s the hard part, it’s making sure they are the right type, so there’s been a lot of work checking on backgrounds and how they are away from the pitch.“And when you look to last season, St Mirren and Livingston were successful using two different styles but what they had in common was they were physically strong.“I think at times we were lacking that so we have made sure we’ve got players who can play but also handle the other side of it as well.”Or so he believes, and Luggy accepts proof United have got it right this time will only come via the results.“The proof of the pudding starts with Arbroath. It’s been a very good pre-season and everyone has enjoyed it but now we have to take the hard work on to the park.“Arbroath is a good game to start because I know Dick and Ian Campbell very well and they will come to Tannadice looking for a result.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"randy wolters leaves dundee to join nec on two year deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Randy Wolters has left Dundee to join Dutch side NEC.The 28-year-old still had another year on his deal at Dens Park but the two parties have come to a mutual agreement meaning Wolters could leave for pastures new.He has now penned a two-year deal with Dutch second tier side NEC (Nijmegen Eendracht Combinatie).Wolters previously told of his struggles with homesickness having played all of his career in the Netherlands before joining Dundee last summer.He made 16 appearances for the Dark Blues.Before the move in a press conference today, McCann said: “Randy moving on is a possibility.\u0026#8220He’s very frustrated he didn’t feature more.

An employment tribunal awarded him more than £10,000.But now Mr Brown, who runs events and production company The Longest Forty, is taking the club and American director Mr Nelms to a tribunal again – this time citing post-employment victimisation and harassment.The action stems from a dispute over a Legends of the Ball – Champions 2013/2014 event which was due to take place at the Doubletree by Hilton on the outskirts of the city in February.It is understood that Mr Brown alleges that Dens Park chief Mr Nelms contacted Hilton boss Richard Ellison and forced him to cancel the event – leading to a breach of contract – and said he was unhappy someone who was successful in a claim against the club was working alongside the hotel.He also alleges Mr Nelms prevented current Dundee players Craig Wighton and Cammy Kerr from attending the event, despite them having already agreed to do so and having been advertised as appearing.The event was cancelled and Mr Brown alleges this was due to his previous case against Dundee.He now wants damages and alleges that Mr Nelms’ actions were maliciously motivated.It is understood both the club amd Mr Nelms dispute Mr Brown’s claims and insist he did not intervene and that official permission was never sought for players to attend the event.Dundee FC and representatives for Mr Nelms declined to comment.Solicitor Ryan Russell, of Muir Myles and Laverty, confirmed he had been instructed to pursue a claim on Mr Brown’s behalf.He said: “Due to the ongoing legal proceedings, it would inappropriate to comment at this stage on the specifics or merits of the claim.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Sunday 15 Jul 2018 1:34 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116630.jpg","title":"Schoolgirls inspiring bid to wipe out racism","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED eight-year-old has been praised after taking an inspirational stand against racism in her community by personally removing a vile message she found defacing a local mural.Breagha Gowans spotted the anti-Muslim slur scribbled on the wall of an underpass near Culloden Wood while out for a walk with her mother Michelle.After the pair had a chat about what exactly the message \u0026ndash which the Courier will not print \u0026ndash meant, the youngster decided to step up and take it upon herself to erase it, gathering a bag full of cleaning equipment for the job.\"I wanted to clean up the graffiti because I have a friend at school who is Muslim and I didn\u0026rsquot want her to be upset,\" she said.\"I wanted to be kind towards others.\"The underpass where Breagha spotted the graffiti passes below Barn Church Road and is covered in a colourful mural in a deliberate bid to dissuade would-be vandals from defacing the walls.After scrubbing the wall clean again, she appealed to everyone to show more respect towards those around them.\"Please don\u0026rsquot do it because it is hateful and no-one likes bullies,\" she said.\"It isn\u0026rsquot good to hurt people\u0027 feelings and I didn\u0026rsquot like to see something that would make someone feel bad.\"Breagha\u0027 father is Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans who said he was proud of the way she had decided to tackle the problem head-on.\"I told her it was fantastic \u0026ndash though like a typical eight-year-old she was off doing something else,\" he said.\"Breagha and her class have been learning about different religions at Inshes Primary School and she has a very strong sense of justice and fairness.\"It is a testament to what they are teaching in school.

A friendly at Inverness Caley Thistle on Wednesday had to be called off due to injury problems.Summer signing Stephen Gleeson (knee), Niall McGinn (thigh), Mikey Devlin (groin) and Frank Ross (groin) are injured.The Reds are still awaiting the full results of a scan which will reveal the extent of Gleeson’s injury.He will miss tomorrow’s friendly with Cove Rangers, but the Dons are still hopeful he could feature against Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round, the first leg of which is on July 26.Another summer signing, Chris Forrester (groin), and Sam Cosgrove (calf) were also injured but are expected to be fit to face Cove tomorrow.So far this summer the Dons have only signed three players with £200,000 outlaid for the capture of Forrester from Peterborough United.Republic of Ireland international Gleeson was secured on a free. An SPFL tribunal will decide the training compensation due for teenager Lewis Ferguson who signed from Hamilton.Polish defender Krystian Nowak is currently training with the Dons and is set to feature as a trialist in tomorrow’s friendly.The 24-year-old is a free agent having had his contract with Greek side Panionios terminated earlier this summer.Aberdeen also had a bid for Doncaster striker John Marquis, understood to be for £250,000, rejected.Boss Derek McInnes confirmed that bid was the highest the Reds could go to and they will now look at other potential targets for centre-forward.Celtic and Rangers have both invested heavily in their squads this season.But Considine insists the heavy spending of the Old Firm will only inspire Aberdeen.He said: “Celtic always generate so much money through their transfers and whatever.“You expect it from them.“Due to the situation with Rangers they haven’t been able to do that, but this year they have. It is great to see and is healthy for Scottish football.“A strong Rangers is good for the league.“It also brings us on.“In the past few years or so we have still remained second so regardless of what they are going to spend we are still going to challenge this season again.”Aberdeen’s preparations for the Euro tie with Burnley conclude with a friendly against West Brom at Pittodrie on Friday.The Baggies were relegated to the Championship at the end of last season.Considine said: ”When we play West Brom here that will be a good indication of what is coming.“Although they were obviously relegated, in my eyes they are still a Premier League team.“That will be a good test for us and will show where we are at and what is coming opposition wise.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen road to shut for five days for resurfacing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDrivers are being warned that a road is to close for five days as resurfacing works are carried out.Bankhead Avenue in Bucksburn will be closed between its junctions with Bankhead Road and the access road to Bankhead Industrial Estate from 7.30am on July 23 until 10pm on July 27.Bankhead Road will also be closed between Station Road and Greenburn Road.Access to properties will be maintained as far as possible, with the closures necessary to protect public safety during carriageway resurfacing works.Diversions will be in place for drivers looking to travel this way.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"charities share 6000 after highland games","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA number of community groups are to receive grants following a north-east sport event.Twelve organisations will get a share of £6,000 following the success of last year’s 150th Aboyne Highland Games in August.Second Aboyne Brownies and Archway Aberdeen will each receive £250.Meanwhile £500 will be given to Aberdeen Mountain Rescue, Aberdeen Street Pastors, Aboyne Football Club, Aboyne Gymnastics \u0026amp Trampoline Club, Aboyne Primary School Parent Council, Mid Deeside Day Centre, Cromar Seniors Association, Glen Tanar Charitable Trust and Praesmohr Nursing Home Residents Amenity Fund.£1,000 is to be gifted to Aboyne Playgroup.Aboyne Highland Games chairman Alistair Grant said: “Last year’s 150th anniversary resulted in a large crowd, which put us in a very fortunate position to be able to increase the amount of money we are distributing to good causes in 2018.\u0026#8220The groups we have chosen mean that people of all ages are benefitting from the continued success of Aboyne Highland Games.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b484238d8397-564x564.jpg ","title":"group bid to improve stunning coastal path","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group has launched a campaign to upgrade a coastal path to show off the great views between two north-east towns.It is hoped the route between Inverbervie and St Cyrus can be improved after discussions took place between community groups and potential funding partners.A steering group has now been set up to pursue different funding options and talks are believed to be at an advanced stage.There is currently a path between St Cyrus and Inverbervie running along the former railway line, but some of it is in a poor condition and other sections have been eroded.Mearns councillor Leigh Wilson has been helping the group.He said: “The coastal path is a local treasure with some of the most picturesque views in the north-east.“The path from Bervie to Gourdon has been resurfaced and it is a wonderful asset.“I remember the path before the work was done and it was almost unwalkable after spells of heavy rain, so what we have now is really ideal.“It has also opened up access to people of all degrees of mobility.“The next step of the project is an ambition to resurface the Gourdon to Johnshaven path.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going. Local band The Democrats brought the curtain down on this year’s festival in style.With just three people in the festival committee it fell to organiser Margaret MacNeill to comment on this year’s event saying: \u0026#8216Thank you to everyone who came and joined in with this year\u0026#8217s Seafood Festival.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-spca-report-80-per-cent-increase-in-calls-about-dogs-in-hot-cars","story":"THE Scottish SPCA are urging Borders residents to ensure their pets stay safe during the warm weather.\nScotland\u0026rsquos animal welfare charity has seen an 80 per cent increase in calls to their animal helpline from members of the public concerned about dogs in hot cars. within the last few weeks.\nScottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: \"We\u0027re very concerned at the number of reports we\u0027re receiving about dogs being left inside cars during the hot weather.\n\"Owners need to understand that it\u0027s completely unacceptable to leave a dog in a vehicle in these searing temperatures, even for a short period of time with the windows down.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links.

The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.  Mr Paul, who is chairman of Glasclune Residents Association, said: \u0026ldquoWe feel that it is the wrong site for this.  \u0026ldquoWe are open to the accusation that it\u0026rsquos because it is at the back of our house and that\u0026rsquos partly fair \u0026ndash ideally we\u0026rsquod like to see the shelter pulled down.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than just saying it\u0026rsquos not right, we\u0026rsquove offered to the youth project to fundraise for an alternative.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of people who live here who have experience of managing projects.  Preliminary community consultation has taken place through an online survey, with 80 per cent backing the youth project\u0026rsquos proposals.  Lauren Cowie, project manager at North Berwick Youth Project, insisted plans were \u0026ldquostill at a very early stage.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to working with the entire community and in particular those who live near the proposed shelter. As the project moves forward, the community and the residents will be consulted at every stage, including the design.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.  The achievement was highlighted by school interim headteacher, Lauren Rodger, in her newsletter.  She added: \u0026ldquoAnyone seeing Clara perform here at Knox will know that she is a natural percussionist and we\u0026rsquore delighted for her."},{"url":null,"title":"kit-fraser-republishes-his-dads-story-of-time-with-macbrayne","story":"  Chris Fraser\u0026rsquos autobiography Christie Boy: A MacBrayne\u0026rsquos Man was released in 1994.  Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day. The classical music enthusiast and trumpeter has also worked on a documentary about Felix Mendelssohn and is currently working on one on Fryderyk Chopin.  Now, following his graduation, he can\u0026rsquot wait to get his documentary career under way in earnest.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhilst studying I have been coached and trained by lecturers who are well-known in the industry and it has been wonderful to benefit from their experience.  \u0026ldquoI am now in the process of sitting down with production companies, and looking forward to establishing my own name as a documentary maker.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

But the tycoon - whose family is one of Turkey\u0026rsquos most powerful - did so through a complex series of tax haven holdings meaning his name has never been mentioned.  Now Mr Sabanci\u0026rsquos holding firm, The Herald can reveal, has quietly revealed its ownership after its offshore dealings emerged in the Turkish press through the giant \u0026ldquoParadise Papers data leak of late last year.  Staff contacted by The Herald were unaware of any Turkish beneficial ownership of the centres.    Sevket Sabanci\u0026nbsp  News media have previously named other entities as owners of the centres. Most recently, Aberdeen\u0026rsquos city paper, The Evening Express, described a UK business called Capreon as Bon Accord\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoowner. This is incorrect.  A spokesman for the firm said: \u0026ldquoCapreon is the Asset Manager for the owners of the shopping centre, called Aberdeen Shopping Centre Ltd. This organisation is backed by a group of investors, which includes the Sabanci family.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspAgenda: Morality, not legality, should be the last word on the Paradise Papers  The Herald can confirm that the property is held by two companies registered in the tax haven of Guernsey called Aberdeen Shopping Centre Limited and Aberdeen Shopping Centre Limited No2.  It is not unusual for retail property in the UK to be owned offshore, including in the Channel Islands.  SNP MP Kirsty Blackman, whose Aberdeen North constituency includes the shopping centres, has been campaigning on corporate transparency in the House of Commons.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe Bon Accord Centre has been a fixture in Aberdeen\u0026rsquos town centre for nearly 30 years. It\u0026rsquos part of the fabric of our city and it\u0026rsquos concerning to note that there are questions relating to its ownership.  \u0026ldquoOne of the problems with the UK\u0026rsquos system is that ownership of places like the Bon Accord Centre can be really opaque and, in some cases, pretty much impossible to trace.  Mr Sabanci and some other family members and other investors have a firm called Esas Holdings, its best known asset is the Turkish low-cost airline Pegasus. Esas has confirmed its owns the Aberdeen shopping centres.    Kirsty Blackman  Back in 2013, Bon Accord and St Nicholas were said to have been sold for \u0026pound189m to a firm called F\u0026ampC Reit, whose property wing was bought out last year by the Noe Group, parent of Capreon.

However in a case described as \"shocking\" even to veteran asylum lawyers assisting him, he was detained during a routine appointment to sign on with the Home Office and deported back to Ethiopia, where he feared for his life.  He claims that he was mistreated on route, with excess pressure applied to handcuffs to keep him quiet, and once in Ethiopia \u0026ndash where both his father and brother were imprisoned, tortured and later died due to their opposition to the ruling regime \u0026ndash was forced to flee into Sudan illegally, to avoid capture.  Meanwhile his lawyer, Lia Devine of Latta Law \u0026ndash working with advocate Alan Caskie \u0026ndash took the case to the Court of Session, where judge Lord Colin Tyre ruled that the Home Office must issue Yitbarek with new travel documents and flights and return him to the UK at its expense. He returned earlier this month, was reunited with his pregnant girlfriend and is continuing with his asylum claim.  Describing the ruling as \"groundbreaking\" Devine said: \"We knew we had a strong case in terms of what had happened, however, we were never sure if we would ever be able to obtain an order for his return. This does not happen often. We were all delighted with the result achieved.\"  Stuart McDonald SNP spokesman on Immigration, Asylum and Border Control, said the latest in a long line of irresponsible decision making by the Home Office meant there was now cause to \"look at whether the Home Office should at least be stripped of its role in deciding asylum applications\".  He added: \u0026ldquoThe Home Office continues to act like a law unto itself \u0026ndash not only putting into full force the Conservative government\u0026rsquos awful policies and rules, but too often going further and behaving in an even more outrageous way. From Windrush to unlawful detentions, a mixture of under resourcing and poor decision making means the Home Office is too often getting it wrong.\"  Celia Clarke, director of campaigning group Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID), said that wrongful return sometimes went unchallenged. Surveys for BID show that only half of those in detention centres have legal representation. She said: \"Detention is meant to be used as a last resort but in practice we find that it is being used as a first resort.\"  A Home Office spokesperson confirmed that Yitbarek had been \"removed in error\". \"As soon as the court ruling was received, arrangements were put in place to return him to the UK for his case to be dealt with,\" she added.  Solomon Getnet Yitbarek from Ethiopia, now 27, fled to Sudan with his mother and brother after his father had been arrested by Ethiopian authorities for his political actives. It was too dangerous to return to their own country, yet life here was difficult too. Five years ago he met a British Ethiopian woman at church and the two married and came to the UK, where they settled in London. He was working, studying, and he was safe.  But the relationship broke down after three years, by which point his brother had also been arrested and detained in Ethiopia. \u0026ldquoThe same issue was the politics that my dad had also been arrested for, he says. Afraid for his future, Yitbaret, who had also campaigned for Ginbot 7 \u0026ndash a peaceful Ethiopian opposition political organisation whose members have been targeted and detained by the Ethiopian government \u0026ndash sought advice and applied for asylum. However his case was refused. The Home Office said it did not believe him.  He was detained for immigration purposes and moved to several detention centres before ending up in Dungavel in March this year, where he had to find a new lawyer and was put in touch with Lia Devine, of Latta Law. She believed there were grounds to put in a fresh asylum claim, and after doing so, applied successfully for bail.  But within a matter of weeks, at a routine appointment he was detained again while signing on with the Home Office, this time being held in a police station for almost 48 hours before being taken to Morton Hall detention centre. \"I told them I had an outstanding case,\" he explains. \"But they said they had been ordered to detain me. They took all my stuff including my phone, searched me and put me in the cells. \u0026ldquoI was very scared about what was going to happen next, what would happen to me if I was sent back to Ethiopia.\"  Once he had been taken to a detention centre a shocked Devine applied for bail the following Tuesday \u0026ndash the the first available date \u0026ndash reassured Yitbarek that under UK law his active asylum claim meant he could not be deported and left the office for the weekend. But to his horror he was then moved to IRC Heathrow and after a brief meeting on Sunday \u0026ndash when he was unable to contact his lawyer \u0026ndash was told he would be deported back to Ethiopia.  \u0026ldquoI kept telling them I had an outstanding case, but they didn\u0027t listen. They put a belt on me with handcuffs and I was taken in a van straight to the plane and put in the back while everyone was boarding. It was awful. I was crying and saying \u0026ldquoplease help me but nobody was doing anything. The guard told me if you don\u0027t behave I\u0027ll tell them you are with Ginbot 7. I was very scared. Then he started squeezing the handcuffs \u0026ndash it hurt so much I screamed out. He told me if I didn\u0027t keep quiet he would keep squeezing them. I felt I had no choice. I had marks after.\"  Once there he was taken to an office inside the airport where they handed over his passport to the Ethiopian official. He was told to follow him, but seeing him heading towards three police men he took fright and ran. He initially went into hiding with a fellow supporter of the party, but after learning that his brother had also been tortured in detention and had died following release, he fled, making a dangerous and illegal border crossing to Sudan.Meanwhile Devine went to the Scottish Court of Session in Edinburgh and phoned him with life changing news.  \u0026ldquoWhen she told me that the Home Office had been ordered to return me [to the UK] I was so shocked,\" says Yitbaret. \"I had been feeling hopeless. Now I was just like \"wow!\". I was so shocked and so happy, all these mixed feelings after everything that had happened.  Travel was arrived from Khartoum,Sudan\u0027s capital where he flew back to Heathrow to be reunited with his now pregnant girlfriend. \"It just felt like a dream,\" he said. \"Now I want to be safe, to have my case considered and have a normal life in the UK.\""},{"url":null,"title":"15-stunning-photographs-of-the-glasgow-forth-and-clyde-canal","story":"              Once\u0026nbspthe main driver for economic development, canals in Scotland are now primarily a backdrop to days out, fishing trips and watersports.

Surprisingly, he\u0026rsquos a man, not a woman, and the organiser of music festivals and events. But then anyone, as the collective has often said, can be Pussy Riot. Anyone can perform in one of their cut-out balaclava masks. Anyone can protest in their spirit.  Russia, he says, has only got worse for activists since the Pussy Riot trial. \u0026ldquoThe difference is huge, he says, \u0026ldquoand not positive. For example, in 2010, the predecessor of Pussy Riot, Voina Group, made a very famous action called A Dick Captured By The FSB. They drew a penis, in nine seconds, on a big drawbridge in St Petersburg. When the drawbridge was up, and the ships had to pass for several hours, the authority couldn\u0026rsquot do anything with this bridge. And what was the result? A state award of $50,000 by the Minister of Culture Federation.  Before the trial of Pussy Riot, Cheparukhin observes, \u0026ldquoIt seemed everything was possible in Russia. My personal opinion is that for 15-20 years Russia was in fact, in the area of artistic freedom, the most free country in the world. But things changed during a wave of protests around 2011 and 2012, of which Pussy Riot was part. \u0026ldquoSince this time Russian legislation became much more severe. For instance in 2012 whatever Pussy Riot did, they only deserved by law something like five days of community service. That\u0026rsquos why this court was such a shock for us. They did something which was a small hooliganism and deserved five days of community service. But they were accused of hooliganism based on religious hatred, which was not the truth. There was no religious hatred there. So it was like a special attempt of power of Kremilin to show everybody, \u0027Don\u0026rsquot do this.\u0027  Since then, he notes, Russian law has become more restrictive. \u0026ldquoThe Russian parliament has accepted so many new laws which are very repressive. You can be thrown to prison even for posting a document on Facebook.  Among the Pussy Riot members who have been recently detained is Maria Alyokhina, or \u0026ldquoMasha as she is often called, one of the most famous of Pussy Riot\u0026rsquos members, who, during her trial cross-examined witnesses and said, in her closing statement defiantly denounced Russia\u0026rsquos \"totalitarian-authoritarian system.  \u0026ldquoMasha was arrested yesterday, Cheparukhin says, as he explains why he is distracted by his phone\u0026rsquos constant beep of messages. He is trying, he adds, to \u0026ldquosolve an issue for her, following her release, with a fine of \u0026pound5000, which she does not intend to pay  For Alyokhina, this recent detention and fine is a minor affair. She has, after all, been horse whipped by Cossacks for protesting at the Olympic Games in Sochi, done a hunger strike in prison, and experienced single-cell confinement. Her transgressions on this occasion were twofold. The first, that she had evaded a 100-hour community service that she was sentenced to after, in April, she released boxes of paper airplanes outside the headquarters of Russia\u0026rsquos Federal Security Service, in protest at Russia-wide ban on encrypted messaging service Telegram. The second because she evaded a further 40-hour community service, given as sentence for a visit she made to the FSB office on the centennial of the Soviet secret police, with a sign that read, \u0026ldquoHappy birthday, executioners.  Much of her campaigning nowadays is focussed on the injustices of Russia\u0027s court and penal system. Last year, she and fellow Pussy Riot member, Olga Borisova, staged a protest outside a Siberian prison, with banner and flares, objecting to the imprisonment of Crimean film director Oleg Sentsov on a 20 year sentence under terrorist offences.  What was shocking in 2012, however, wasn\u0026rsquot just the trial itself, but the degree of misogyny that was unleashed in the wider Russian public. They were called \u0026ldquowhores and \u0026ldquosluts and threatened with rape and burning. This summer, from August 2 to September 26, Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Summerhall will also host Free The Pussy, an exhibition of artworks that were made in response to Pussy Riot\u0026rsquos imprisonment in 2012, curated by gender political artist Tamsyn Challenger. Including works by Yoko Ono, Judy Chicago and Carolee Schneemann, it is testimony to the impact of Pussy Riot on artists and activists across the rest of the world. It also highlights the misogyny experienced by Pussy Riot and many other women activists.  Challenger, who has often be described as an artist-agitator, first became involved with work around Pussy Riot, in 2012, when the women were on trial, and she contributed to a responsive book called Let\u0026rsquos Start A Pussy Riot. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove created a womb room cinema, she says. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove got a forty second countdown meow clock. The pub, The Royal Dick, is going to be turned into The Royal Pussy. And, off the back of Maedeh Hojabri, the Iranian girl who was arrested for dancing on Instagram, I\u0026rsquom creating a cordoned off space in which women can dance and are free to dance.  Cheparukhin believes that Pussy Riot probably has more followers in the west now than in Russia. \u0026ldquoA lot of people thought they were wrong in doing their action in church and I cannot say that there are a lot of real followers of them in Russia. There are a lot of people who protested against their imprisonment, yes. Maybe hundreds of thousands. But I wouldn\u0026rsquot say that they influenced that much the behaviour of young people. I would say their influence is bigger in the west.  Meanwhile, in Russia, some see them as having brought on the ongoing clampdown on opposition activists. \u0026ldquoPussy Riot was definitely a turning point. That\u0026rsquos why the attitude towards the collective is contradictory for many people. Even some opposition people think that they triggered this very reactionary behaviour of the government. Before Pussy Riot, the reaction to mass protests was much more liberal. After Pussy Riot, step by step, the Russian state started to call protestors enemies. And now most of the people who are against Putin are called enemies.  Nevertheless, he says, they were an \u0026ldquointegral part of this history of the protest movement of 2011-12 and maybe one of the brightest parts. One of the best things they have done, since their trial and imprisonment, he says, was to set up the news website, Mediazona, which highlights court and prison injustices. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very strong. And it\u0026rsquos a major media force now. It\u0026rsquos not like hidden underground it\u0026rsquos major. Even the government have to take into account their articles and reports, very brave reports.  Prior to the World Cup 2018, many hoped that there would be a boycott of the country as host. Cheparukhin was among them. \u0026ldquoI initially thought I would be happy if it was boycotted, he says. \u0026ldquoBut I\u0026rsquove been in Moscow during the World Cup and I think finally it was good for Russian people because it\u0026rsquos such a good atmosphere. Very peaceful, a lot of love and friendship.\" He admired, he says, how tolerant the police were with some of the fans. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos incredible and really new there. Incredibly new. You see very friendly police and it doesn\u0026rsquot mean that they are instructed to be like this. No, they just admire this atmosphere when like tens of thousands of people are dancing in the centre of Moscow. So finally I liked it very much.  A boycott, he says, would have been a \u0026ldquoproper political gesture against Putin\u0026rsquos regime. \u0026ldquoBut,he adds, \u0026ldquosince it was not boycotted, I think the best you can do is celebrate its spirit of friendship. And, by the way, a lot of opposition people, some Pussy Riot members, also were jumping around in this crowd in Moscow. They liked it. There was even swimming in fountains in the centre of Moscow.  Free The Pussy: women arrested for activism  Maedeh Hojabri: The Iranian teen who amassed a huge Instagram following for her videos featuring her dancing, became one of many in her country to have been arrested under their laws for dancing in public. When last week, she appeared on Iranian television, giving what appeared to be a forced confession, there was a huge backlash. A wave of supporters of Hojabri posted videos of themselves dancing with the hashtag #dancingisnotacrime.  China\u0026rsquos Feminist Five: In March 2015, ten young Chinese feminists were arrested by Beijing police for planning to hand out stickers about sexual harassment on International Women\u0026rsquos Day. Five were criminally detained for over a month, triggering an international outcry. Their plight went viral under the hashtag #\u0026rsquoFreetheFive  Saudi women drivers: The ban on women driving in Saudia Arabia may have been lifted this year, but even as it was there were still women in jail for having defied it. Among them was Loujain al-Hathloul, a well-known young activist, who spent 73 days in jail for defying the ban in 2014 and came to world attention for a short video she posted on YouTube of her arrest as she attempted to drive across the border from the United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.  Megumi Igarashi: In 2014, who works under the pseudonym Rokudenashiko \u0026ndash or good-for-nothing girl \u0026ndash was arrested after she distributed data that enabled recipients to make 3D prints of her vagina. She was later found guilty of obscenity and fined 400,000 yen (\u0026pound2,575)."},{"url":null,"title":"caledonia-dreaming-follow-the-sensational-story-of-scottish-rock","story":"  Harvey went through several incarnations in his musical career, cut short by a heart attack, he had won a competition as the \"Scottish Tommy Steele\", I saw him in the doldrums playing rhythm guitar in the orchestra of the musical Hair in London, and later still he would transmogrify into a glam rocker in his \"sensational\" phase, but the original, as the song goes, is still the greatest.  He would reel onstage, fortified by cheap red wine and uppers, and introduce himself, the band marking musical time, \"My name is Alex Harvey and this is the Soul Band. And we\u0027ve been framed,\" leading into what was more an early precursor of rap than a song.  But if Harvey was the Godfather of Scottish rock and pop his adjutant was Jimmy Grimes, the bass player and a merchant seaman who brought back the records which influenced the band, calypso and particularly blues, and which they copied. Grimes, known as \"the General\", had been asked to join the band with an inimitable come on, \"How would you like to get into debt?\"  Harvey\u0027s younger brother Lesley was a virtuoso guitar player who formed the Kinning Park Ramblers (where the family were from), including his girlfriend Maggie Bell and singer Bobby Kerr. Lessley later formed Stone the Crows with Maggie Bell and died, electrocuted onstage in Wales aged 27 (it\u0027s a fateful age for rock stars, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Kurt Cobain make up a grisly club). Kerr went on to sing with the Joe Loss Orchestra on radio and he, too died, killed on his moped by a motorist.  The daytime hangout and a place where cross-pollination occurred between bands was McCormack\u0027s music shop in Bath Street (the family were actually McCormicks, but suffered anti-Catholic bias) now closed. Groups like the Poets, the Beatstalkers and the Pathfinders floated in and out and touring bands, like the Rolling Stones, actually borrowed equipment. This was the 1960s where the lavish touring caravanserai of today were only a dream.  On the east coast the Dundee Horns (Malcolm \u0027\"Molly\" Duncan and Roger Ball) would be joined by drummer Robbie McIntosh \u0026ndash another rock casualty \u0026ndashAlan Gorrie, Hamish Stuart, Owen McIntyre from Auchinairn and later become funk meisters the Average White Band, sign to Jerry Wexler\u0027s Atlantic Records and have a worldwide Number 1 in Pick Up The Pieces.

In a BBC documentary she claims that Abba\u0027s Agnetha Faltskog covered their songs and that Abba modelled their sound on her band\u0027s.  By then Lulu had gone to London, modified her style and accent, appeared in a film and then married a Bee Gee (another tragedy).

And of course the discussion is taking place on Trump\u0027s favourite platform, Twitter.  Trump tormentors \u0026ndash even self-described \"non-royalists\" \u0026ndash took to Twitter to acidly note moments during the tea time meeting at Windsor Castle when Trump did something that could be interpreted as a faux pas.  None of these moments were especially horrifying. He didn\u0027t grab her in a bear hug or trash her in a tweet as \"fake news\". But he did keep her waiting for more than 10 minutes (which may not have been his fault), shook her hand instead of bowing, turned his back on her for a few seconds, and he left his jacket open and flapping and his too-long tie trailing.  Many seized on the TV footage of Trump and the 92-year-old Queen preparing to review scarlet-clad troops assembled in the Quadrangle of Windsor Castle where they met.

But now ministers have clamped down and decided that they can\u0026rsquot release any findings at all on security grounds.  Experts have accused the MoD of trying to evade public scrutiny, hide \u0026ldquocock-up and incompetence and endanger public safety. But the MoD has insisted that the secrecy had not prevented independent assessment of the nuclear programme, which met \u0026ldquoall the required standards.  Safety during the refurbishment, transportation and storage of Trident nuclear warheads, along with the operation of the UK reactor-powered submarine fleet based at Faslane near Helensburgh, is regulated by the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator (DNSR). Unlike the civil nuclear power industry, which is overseen by the independent Office for Nuclear Regulation, DNSR is part of the MoD.  After a prolonged freedom of information battle, the MoD started publishing DNSR annual reports from 2005. They were released over ten years until 2014-2015, highlighting issues as \u0026ldquoregulatory risks 86 times, including 13 rated as high priority, 50 as medium priority and 23 as low priority.  One of the issues often rated by DNSR as a high risk was a growing shortage of suitably qualified and experienced nuclear engineers. The report for 2014-15 warned that the lack of skilled staff was \u0026ldquothe principal threat to the delivery of nuclear safety.  It also cautioned that \u0026ldquoattention is required to ensure maintenance of adequate safety performance for ageing nuclear submarines. Similar concerns were highlighted in DNSR reports for 2013-14, 2012-13 and previous years.  The 2007 report flagged up 11 \"potentially significant risks\" at military nuclear sites, and the 2006 report warned that \"crew fatigue\" could cause hazards during the transport of nuclear warheads by road.  In November 2018 the Sunday Herald revealed that the MoD had abruptly decided to stop publishing the annual DNSR reports to protect national security. Last week the defence minister, Guto Bebb, went further, refusing to give any indication of even the headline summaries of the reports covering the last three years.  Labour\u0026rsquos defence spokesperson, Fabian Hamilton, asked the MoD \u0026ldquowhat category of safety assurance was assigned to the nuclear domain by the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator for the years 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18.  Bebb confirmed that DNSR reports for those years contained \u0026ldquothe level of safety assurance, but insisted they \u0026ldquowill not be published as it has been assessed to do so would impact national security.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis does not prevent the effective management and independent assessment of the defence nuclear programme, nor prevent its duty holders being held to account, but in the current security climate we cannot accept compromising our capabilities by disclosing the reports or details contained within.  The Scottish National Party attacked the MoD\u0026rsquos secrecy. \u0026ldquoThis is simply not good enough and the MoD have a bad track record on transparency, said the party\u0027s defence spokesperson, Stewart McDonald MP.  \u0026ldquoSafety and security are paramount when it comes to anything nuclear \u0026ndash and we need to be confident that is always the case.  The independent nuclear engineer, John Large, described national security as a \u0026ldquoflimsy excuse for hiding nuclear safety issues. He suggested that the four Vanguard submarines that carry Trident warheads will all have to be brought into dock for unplanned overhauls because of problems with the ageing reactors that drive them.  \u0026ldquoThere is good reason to believe that both human resource and technical issues are continuing to impact on the reliability and full strength deployment of both the hunter-killer and Vanguard nuclear-powered submarines, he said.  \u0026ldquoThe suppression of if and how the Royal Navy is reaching its nuclear safety targets is of great concern because within the MoD\u0026rsquos hierarchal review structure there is no opportunity for independent assessment. In effect, the buck stops short of a faceless admiral, whose primary duty of providing the nuclear deterrent overrides the safety of the public at large.  Large argued that it was becoming increasingly difficult to determine how many \u0026ldquoskeletons are accumulating in DNSR\u0026rsquos hideaway cupboard. He accused the MoD of losing \u0026ldquoeffective control over its nuclear submarine maintenance and refuelling programme.  \u0026ldquoDNSR is simply failing to keep up with nuclear safety issues, he added. \u0026ldquoProbably what this secrecy is hiding is cock-up and incompetence that, by all unofficial accounts, is growing within a unacceptable environment of unaccountability.  Professor Andy Stirling, a nuclear expert from the University of Sussex, warned that secrecy could hide public dangers. \u0026ldquoThe British military nuclear establishment is increasingly seeking to escape public scrutiny and democratic accountability,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoThe MoD is using the trump card of security to quash reasonable questions. History shows how dangerous this state of affairs can be, and how essential it is to achieve healthy transparency.  The Nuclear Information Service, which monitors the nuclear weapons programme, called on MPs to demand operations be halted unless they can be proved safe. \u0026ldquoIf the MoD cannot give the public basic guarantees about the safety of their nuclear warheads and nuclear submarines, then the obvious conclusion is that safety issues are being hidden from the public, said the service\u0026rsquos director, David Cullen.  \u0026ldquoNo responsible nuclear operator would behave in this cloak and dagger fashion. Parliament should step in and call for a halt any activities where the public cannot be given nuclear safety assurances.  The SNP MP for Edinburgh North and Leith, Deidre Brock, thought the MoD\u0026rsquos behaviour \u0026ldquobeggars belief and demanded the DNSR reports be published. \u0026ldquoA sudden shift from openness to secrecy suggests that something is going wrong and it leaves me wondering whether there is something serious that we are simply not being told about, she said.  \u0026ldquoAre the Tory cuts now biting so deep that operational safety around nuclear weapons is compromised? Have there been mistakes, accidents and near misses that ministers would rather we never saw? Unless they publish the reports we can\u0026rsquot have any idea of what the state of play is.  The MoD defended its decision to suppress the DNSR reports. \u0026ldquoWe no longer publish these reports during this age of intensifying threats as it would risk our national security, said an MoD spokesperson.  \u0026ldquoOur nuclear programme remains fully accountable to ministers, faces regular independent scrutiny and review, and continues to meet all the required standards.  The Labour Party has not responded to a request to comment.

Back then, he refused an offer of a hotel room at 5am, choosing to stay with friends in the morning and believing he would be back in soon.  It soon emerged not only was that not the case.  He, like other homeowners in the area, found that his insurers would not pay out because his property had not been damaged.  Bowen has even been unable to access the flat to check.  \u0026ldquoThe thing for me is that I don\u0026rsquot only live there but work there, he explains. Bowen is the photographer responsible for studio athletics shots for the European Championships 2018, held in Glasgow.  His sporting images are currently seen around the city, as are his photographs for the National Theatre of Scotland posters. But there will be no more any time soon as his cameras and studio equipment are all on lockdown.  \u0026ldquoSo currently I can\u0026rsquot work, he says. \u0026ldquoThankfully there\u0026rsquos the \u0026pound3,000 per household [an agreed emergency payment by the council] which has been helpful in buying the clothes and things that I need to replace. But it\u0026rsquos not compensation.  The issue of insurance has been a particularly trying one, with most companies refusing to pay out.  Council leader Susan Aitken has raised the issue with David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and SNP MP for Glasgow Central Alison Thewliss raised the issue with Theresa May in Parliament. But so far there\u0026rsquos no progress.  Libbie Usher, 20, Sauchiehall Street resident and a nightclub PR manager, has returned to Dundee to stay with her parents because it all got too much. She\u0026rsquos had a brutal month \u0026ndash a week of staying on friends\u0026rsquo sofas, a weekend in a hotel, another week of calling the council\u0026rsquos homeless services every day to find out where she\u0026rsquod spend the night, then finally an offer of a flat so far out she could not afford to get a taxi home from town (she finishes at 3am).  \u0026ldquoIn the end I spoke to my work and they were great and have given me a couple of months off, she says. \u0026ldquoOf course, I don\u0026rsquot get paid but at least I have work to go back to. There was help there I suppose but I had to fight so hard to get it and I just got too exhausted.  She did not have insurance, but says that she has watched those who made monthly payments left high and dry.  Adrian Nairn, resident and historic harp-maker, who also lives in Garnethill just opposite the site of the fire, can\u0026rsquot access work materials either. But he considers himself relatively lucky.  A tenant of Charing Cross Housing Association, he was immediately rehoused by its sympathetic and efficient team.  \u0026ldquoBut a lot of [other] people have been having a terrible time, he says. One family with a disabled son have been forced to move multiple times, struggling to find accommodation to meet his special needs.  \u0026ldquoThe emergency response that the council provided was woeful, he adds. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos taken four weeks for it to appoint someone to take charge of our situation ... We just want someone we can speak to about our problems who can get them fixed. That\u0026rsquos not happened.  Ian Christie, loss adjuster at Christie \u0026amp Co, has now been appointed by residents to address issues they were experiencing with insurance. \u0026ldquoInsurance policies haven\u0026rsquot been triggered because of a lack of damage, he explains \u0026ldquoWhat is unusual in this case is that people are out of their houses for such as long time. If this was a normal building that was endangering others around it then it would come down very quickly.  \u0026ldquoThe emphasis on the historic building makes this a lengthy process which is the problem that the residents have.  \u0026ldquoThe poor souls can\u0026rsquot get into their homes but they can\u0026rsquot claim insurance. The council is treating them as homeless but many of them still own homes that they can\u0026rsquot access because of the cordon.  He is now hoping to argue that damage caused by doors being kicked down during the evacuation process will help \u0026ldquotrigger claims. Meanwhile, residents and businesses are clear. They need leadership and, right now, they feel it is lacking."},{"url":null,"title":"it-was-never-coming-back-to-its-true-home","story":"  In short, it\u0026rsquos oor baw. The modern game that bewitches billions was made in Scotland, not England. The rules and organisation were formed south of the Border but the mature, modern game had its birth on the playing fields of Scotland.  There may be a hint of chauvinism in this declaration but it is cloaked in sadness, too. It accentuates the pain occasioned by such a fall from grace. Scotland gave football the game. It won\u0026rsquot give it back.  The English chorus of It\u0026rsquos Coming Home is understandable but any dismay at its tedious repetition and, indeed, its central misplaced premise, is made all the more galling because of Scotland\u0026rsquos resolute stand not to be involved in the finals of international tournaments.  The semi-final between England and Croatia provided much to ponder for Scots. First, England\u0026rsquos grab on the rights to the creation of Planet Fitba dissolve under forensic scrutiny. The Football Association was formed in England in 1863 but the game was moulded by \u0026ldquoThe Scotch Professors, the players who flooded over the Border to make football a cultured passing game rather than rugby with penalised hand balls.  The first professional footballer in England was James Joseph Lang, a product of Third Lanark, who signed for Sheffield Wednesday in 1876. His professionalism was of the \u0026ldquoshamateur variety. However, when open professionalism was introduced in England in 1885, the number of Scots players soared. For example, the Liverpool side of 1892 was simply described as The Team of the Macs because of the preponderance of Scots.  Scots coaches also took this passing game to every continent. It is with an aching poignancy that one reports that one Scottish triumph in Russia, home of this World Cup, never quite came home. In the 1890s, the Scottish Circle of Amateurs played in St Petersburg with Nevka FC, a team of Scots, winning the inaugural city championship in 1901. So, if it is about football history then Scots win the World Cup.  Unfortunately, it isn\u0026rsquot. This brings us to the second reflection on that semi-final. This concerns Croatia and its ability to produce exceptional players from a population of about four million, a number so small that one can only note that one has bought a bigger round at a wedding.  The success of Croatia produces an acute case of Caledonian angst normally only occasioned by the achievements of such as Uruguay, previous World Cup winners with a population of three million, and Iceland, qualifiers for the finals of the European Championships and World Cup, with a population of 300,000, that is, the precise number that is routinely in carriage three of the 5.15 Queen Street to Waverley train.  The chorus that in no way resembles the joyous expectancy of It\u0026rsquos Coming Home can be summarised as Why Are We So Crap? It produces a national breakdown whose main symptoms are feverish phone-ins, severe hand-wringing and the acute outbreak of a formal inquiry into the state of Scottish football.  But how to do that? The basic equation is simple: more kids playing more football equals better adult footballers. It worked for generations in Scotland when football was largely the only game in town, certainly among the working class in the central belt.  Football was mandatory for the generation of Scots who qualified for World Cups and who won European Cups with Celtic, Liverpool, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa or Borussia Dortmund.  Now it is a choice, in many cases an expensive one that disenfranchises those who once would once be called the working class but are the children of the increasingly alienated non-working class. Now, too, a generation of children can access their need for competition or diversion on tablet or Xbox. Now, too, children who want exercise can choose from sports that were not once largely accessible.  There is a pool of athletic, talented and committed children and all sports are dangling their rods in it. It is why we have, for example, a boxing world champion in the making (Josh Taylor), Olympic gold medal cyclists (Callum Skinner, Katie Archibald), world-class swimmers (Hannah Miley, Ross Murdoch), a genuine, elite athlete (Laura Muir) and the greatest British sportsman ever in Andrew Barron Murray and a former world No1 doubles player in his brother Jamie.  Scottish football may one day prosper in terms of international achievement. It may need only a decent generation complemented by the appearance of a Donald MacBappe or a Stewart MacModric. In the meantime, if it\u0026rsquos not coming home we can at least whistle Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life in hope, if not expectation."},{"url":null,"title":"paul-mccartneys-long-and-winding-road-shows-no-sign-of-ending","story":"  McCartney, 76, is one of a number of ageless, multimillionaire rock stars who still like to hit the road, now and then, simply because it\u0027s in their blood. Think of the Rolling Stones, Roger Waters, Paul Simon (now on his farewell tour), Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison. Joan Baez is on a long farewell tour, Elton John is about to embark on his. And, at 85, Willie Nelson, will be playing gigs until he drops.  There is, though, a special excitement when McCartney announces a new album \u0026ndash Egypt Station, out in September \u0026ndash and an accompanying tour.  He and John Lennon, of course, changed the face of popular music in the 1960s. A measure of their creative relationship comes from Paul Simon. \"You have no idea how competitive John Lennon was around Paul McCartney,\" he told his biographer, Robert Hilburn. \"When I first met them, I felt like someone had taken all the oxygen out of the room. I almost couldn\u0027t breathe, they were so competitive, and that\u0027s what made them so great.\"  The Beatles story is well-known, of course \u0026ndash the initial encounters in the late 1950s, the dues paid in Liverpool\u0027s Cavern and in boisterous clubs on the Hamburg waterfront, the astonishing explosion of Beatlemania in Britain, the success of the debut album, Please Please Me, rush-released in March 1963 on the back of the chart success of the single of the same name.  Fifteen months after Britain, America latched onto the Fab Four, in January 1964 \u0026ndash \"after which nothing was ever the same again,\" observes author Peter Doggett in his history-of-pop-music book, Electric Shock.  Classic songs poured out of Lennon and McCartney at a rate that still astonishes today. The band continued to reach creative peaks, especially from 1965 onwards when their restless experimentation in the studio led to such landmark albums as Revolver, Sgt. Pepper\u0027s Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles (also known as the \"White Album\") and Abbey Road.  Doggett writes of McCartney embarking on a voyage of self-education, \"immersing himself in ... the entire gamut of classical music, from plainsong to the avant-garde electronic sound jazz ... It was McCartney\u0027s ethos that was dominant during the second half of the 1960s, and sparked much of the music \u0026ndash from the Beatles and many others \u0026ndash that is remembered with such affection today.\"  McCartney began his post-Beatles career with a solo album, McCartney, in 1970. Egypt Station will be his seventeenth. He has also recorded and toured with Wings and released a number of classical records. There have even been ambient techno CDs.  His personal life has of course received considerable attention over the years, much of it relating to his marriages (to the late Linda Eastman, then Heather Mills, and Nancy Shevell). His wealth has been estimated at \u0026pound820 million by the Rich List. In May he was made a Companion of Honour (\"I think of how proud my Liverpool mum and dad would have been to see this,\" he said). He has long been outspoken on the issue of animal rights.  He recently guested on James Corden\u0027s Carpool Karaoke segment, cheerfully singing along to such McCartney classics as Let It Be and Penny Lane as Corden drove him around Liverpool. The video has recorded nearly 27 million views on YouTube.  Beatles expert and Glasgow journalist Ken McNab, who is working on a book about the band\u0027s final year, is in no doubt that McCartney is \"rock\u0027n\u0027roll\u0027s Mozart\". He adds: \"Lennon was the driving force, and the heart and spirit of the band, but if it hadn\u0027t been for McCartney\u0027s relentless work ethic, the Beatles would never have lasted three years.  \"Hamish Stuart, who toured with McCartney, once told me that music just pours out of McCartney. Every minute of every day, he\u0027d be whistling a tune.  \"Irrespective of what people think of his current output, even now he still does songs which are annoyingly catchy. You think his recent songs are no Hey Jude, no Let It Be, but they are so catchy. The fact is that he writes melodies that will live forever. I really think he is the greatest melodic composer since Mozart.  \"People will still be singing Paul McCartney songs 200 years from now. A song like Let It Be \u0026ndash you have heard it so often and you think you know it. But the other day I was listening to it and the thought suddenly occurred to me that it is a work of absolute genius,\" he said.  \"There are other great songwriters out there \u0026ndash Elton, Springsteen, and such legendary bands as Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin \u0026ndash but McCartney\u0027s gift as a songwriter is unbelievable. And I say that more as a Lennon fan than a McCartney one.  \"Stars like McCartney and Dylan are still working, still touring, because they just can\u0027t help it,\" McNab adds. \"McCartney was at a party recently with Willie Nelson. They were discussing their careers and their future, and the subject of retirement came up, and Nelson said, \u0027Retire from what?\u0027 That\u0027s exactly right. McCartney has never thought of this as job. It\u0027s a hobby, and if he\u0027s happy to do it, and people still love him for it, then what\u0027s the issue?\""},{"url":null,"title":"council-to-force-re-route-of-orange-walks","story":"  Glasgow City Council\u0027s leader Susan Aitken said if the Orange Order does not voluntarily change the route of parades, the council will \"insist\".

Ms Nielsen said her agency will help state and local election officials prepare their systems for cyber-attacks from Russia or elsewhere.  She said US intelligence officials are seeing \u0026ldquopersistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people, though not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns.  The conference of top state election officials she addressed was sandwiched between Friday\u0026rsquos indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleged to have hacked into Democratic party and campaign accounts, and Monday\u0026rsquos long-awaited meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Mr Trump has never condemned Russia over meddling in the 2016 election despite the findings of all top US intelligence agencies. In the past, Mr Trump has reiterated Mr Putin\u0026rsquos denials, but this week he said he would bring up the issue when they meet on Monday in Finland.  \u0026ldquoAll I can do is say, \u0026lsquoDid you?\u0027 Mr Trump said this week in Brussels. \u0026ldquoAnd, \u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot do it again.\u0026rsquo But he may deny it.  Some of the state officials who run elections say it is important for Mr Trump, a Republican, to take a tougher stance to avoid having the public\u0026rsquos confidence in fair elections undermined.  \u0026ldquoI believe as commander in chief he has an obligation to address it and, frankly, put Putin and any other foreign nation that seeks to undermine our democracy on notice that the actions will not be tolerated, California secretary of state Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said in an interview this week.  Mr Trump portrays the investigation as a partisan attack, but not all Republicans see it that way. This month, the Republicans and Democrats on the US Senate Intelligence Committee backed the findings of an assessment from intelligence agencies that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election and acted in favour of Mr Trump and against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.  As part of that effort, Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states ahead of the election and are believed to have breached the voter registration system in at least one, Illinois, investigators say.  Without naming the state, Friday\u0026rsquos indictment said the Russian intelligence officers stole information on about 500,000 voters from the website of one board of elections, a breach that went undetected for three weeks.  There is no evidence they altered any results, but the attempts prompted the federal government and states to re-examine election systems and tighten their cyber-security.  Federal officials also say it\u0026rsquos possible that malware might have been planted that could tamper with voting or paralyse computer systems in future elections.  The Kremlin has insisted it did not meddle in the US election. Mr Putin\u0026rsquos foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov reaffirmed \u0026ldquothe Russian state has never interfered and has no intention of interfering in US elections."},{"url":null,"title":"clarity-urged-on-post-brexit-status-of-irish-citizens-in-scotland","story":"  In a letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid, External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop said Irish residents of Scotland are \"very concerned\" about \"mixed messages\" on their post-Brexit status.  Calling again for charges for EU citizens to stay in the UK after Brexit to be scrapped, she raised concerns the \u0026pound65 fee for signing up to the settlement scheme for adults and \u0026pound32.50 for children could deter poorer families and the elderly from regularising their status.  In the letter, she said: \"Our overriding concern has always been that EU citizens who came to Scotland to live, work, study and contribute to their communities should not be overly burdened when applying for a status they already have.  \"I am clear that EU citizens should not have to pay a charge to retain the right to live and work in this country, especially children and young people.\"  She said the process and cost of applying for settled status is causing \"anxiety\" for EU families here.  Ms Hyslop highlighted the large number of Irish citizens in Scotland and throughout the UK as of particular concern regarding the settlement scheme.  She said: \"It is vital that clarity is provided for Irish citizens about what status they will have, what rights will be attached to that status, and what the impact will be, if any, of applying or failing to apply for settled status.  \"In conversations we have been having with EU citizens around Scotland, a clear message is that Irish citizens are very anxious about the lack of detail available about their future rights and about the mixed messages they are getting about any obligation to apply for settled status.\"  Ms Hyslop said Scotland\u0027s future population growth depends on inward migration and any additional barriers to this, or to allowing migrants to stay, would be \"damaging to Scotland\u0027s future economic growth\".

In 2015 Edwards sold the chain to US private equity firm, TPG, which also controls restaurant chain, Prezzo.  In 2016-17 it reported losses of \u0026pound17.1m, which was partly the result of tough competition from rival cut-price chains.

Blair Nimmo and Geoff Jacobs of KPMG LLP were appointed as joint administrators on Wednesday last week.                                                    The privately-owned firms operate two service lines from their headquarters in Huntly, comprising the development of private residential homes – mainly in Aberdeenshire – and the provision of design and build contracts for housing associations across the north of Scotland.        Five of the firms’ 14 employees have been made redundant with immediate effect, while the remaining employees have been retained to assist the administrators to realise the companies’ assets, including four sites currently being developed in Peterhead, Burntisland, Keith and Kemnay and Peterhead.Deveron Homes was established in 2002 and the construction arm was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.

Disappointingly, market conditions and contract delays have required both businesses to cease trading. \"We will do everything we can to seek a buyer who may be able to protect the businesses and maximise recoveries for creditors.“The firms have an integrated infrastructure together with a property portfolio and various ongoing contracts. We would encourage any party who has an interest in acquiring both the businesses and assets to contact us as soon as possible.“We will be working with employees and relevant government agencies to ensure the full range of support is available to all those affected.”                                                                                                        Anyone with an interest in buying the assets of the company should contact Geoff Jacobs on 01224 591000 or write to KPMG LLP, 37 Albyn Place, Aberdeen, AB10 1JB.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Sunday 15 Jul 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Halkirk butcher hangs up his apron for the final time","story":"IT was the end of an era in Halkirk as local butcher Hugh John MacKay hung up his shop apron for the last time.Hugh, who ran MacKay\u0026rsquos of Halkirk as well as the Lifestyle Express grocery store, decided to retire after five decades of service.However, the Bridge Street butcher\u0026rsquos shop will still be run by a MacKay as Hugh\u0026rsquos son Matthew will take overHugh was the third in line of MacKays who owned and ran the butcher\u0026rsquos shop for the Halkirk community.Hugh grandfather, John, started the enterprise with a store in Lybster before setting up the shop in Halkirk then it passed on to Hugh\u0026rsquos dad \u0026ndash who was also named Hugh \u0026ndash with his uncle Angus taking over the Lybster shop before handing it over to his son, David.As for the Halkirk shop, Hugh, now 68, was only 16 his father died, \u0026shyleaving the family to take over the running of the shop.Hugh revealed it would not have been a success without the determined work of his mother, Belle.He said: \u0026ldquoI had just turned 16 when my father passed away.

They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems.

The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges.

The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy.

I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Sunday 15 Jul 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Sunday 15 Jul 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 15, 2018 at 9:00 amThe 70th Stromness Shopping Week kicks off, today, Sunday, with the annual hack due to take place starting at 12.30pm.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

We had quite a lot of bad weather just after we started in January, and then we had to wait for the big spring tides so we could carry out a lot of the work.\"The jetty was in fairly poor shape as it had been there for more than 100 years and had spent the entire time being battered by the sea.\"We made the jetty wider and also lengthened it.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768716.1531508333!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan bojo s barmy army is polishing a t d","story":"        Scots Tory MP Ross Thomson\u0026#8217s claim that the UK is set to be \u0026#8216vassal state\u0026#8217 under Theresa May\u0026#8217s Brexit plan looks like pitch to join a future Cabinet under Boris Johnson, writes John McLellan.                The former editor of this newspaper, Magnus Linklater, must shake his head when he sees Boris Johnson bumbling purposefully onto the next publicity stunt, remembering the time when he defeated Bojo in one of the more bizarre elections Edinburgh has witnessed.            In 2006, Linklater’s 3,052 votes were enough to see off Johnson’s challenge to be rector of Edinburgh University, a bid no-one quite understood given the 41-year-old Johnson was already the high-profile MP for Henley and shadow Higher Education spokesman, and had no known connection with the university.             Instrumental in mounting Johnson’s Edinburgh challenge was my old chum Brian Monteith, the then Tory MSP who was to re-emerge at the heart of the Leave.EU PR operation. Even an inveterate plotter as Brian couldn’t have been preparing Bozza for Brexit 12 years ago, and the suspicion was it was just a profile-raiser. It worked as long as the campaign lasted, with a beer-drenching the highlight of a raucous campaign, but the PR bubble burst the minute he lost. In fact he came third, with Linklater second to the victorious Green MSP Mark Ballard.READ MORE: Donald Trump lashes out at Theresa May in extraordinary interviewIt might also have worked as a publicity stunt to attract more English public school types without enough A levels for Oxbridge or Durham, but Johnson has barely been seen in the capital since. His two terms as Mayor of London were regarded as a success, largely due to his flamboyant fronting of the London Olympics, but then came his calculating, cynical approach to the EU referendum. The twists of fate which followed the result saw his prime ministerial ambitions raised, dashed and then revived by Theresa May as her Foreign Secretary. Working out Johnson’s motivation has never been too difficult for those who know him well and selfless service has never been high on the list, but few have described his character with such elegant venom as another who resuscitated his career, former Daily  editor Max Hastings who hired him after the young reporter was sacked by The Times for fabricating stories in 1988.            “It is a common mistake to suppose Johnson a nice man,” wrote Hastings in, appropriately, The Times this week. “Johnson’s glittering intelligence is not matched by self-knowledge ... He is a man of remarkable gifts, flawed by an absence of conscience, principle or scruple. It has been a misfortune for Britain that through two years when diplomacy has been critically important we have been represented abroad by a jester.”One who would whole-heartedly agree is Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson who all but called him a liar as the EU referendum reached its climax and has followed it up with regular jibes ever since. She was one of the first out the blocks from outside the Cabinet this week to support the Prime Minister after Johnson’s resignation over the Chequers Brexit plan.But, at the same time, fundamentalist Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Iain Duncan-Smith were preparing amendments to the Customs Bill which, when it comes up for debate in the Commons on Monday, could yet rip the guts out the White Paper which followed the Chequers plan.READ MORE: Theresa May to Boris Johnson: ‘It is only right your should step down’            So what are we humble foot soldiers, the Conservative councillors and activists who must take all this out to the public, to make of it all? With a subject so vast boiled down to one word “Leave”, no party has found unanimous agreement within their ranks about what it should mean, no matter what they might tell the public. Even First Minister Nicola Sturgeon knows there are 400,000 SNP supporters like Jim Sillars who want as little to do with Brussels as they do London. The Prime Minister’s responsibility is to construct a viable way forward for the negotiations which honours the referendum result but addresses the realpolitik of the situation, which is what she appeared to have done. Not the finished article, but real progress nonetheless,  Good deal, bad deal or no deal (and every trader knows the other side must think you will walk away, no matter the consequences), what the poor bloody Conservative infantry need more than anything else is a sense of purpose and direction, a solid position we can defend and promote. Finally, last weekend we got one, until the egos started to land. The alternative to Ruth Davidson’s call to put “shoulders to the wheel” in support of the Chequers Plan is to play into the hands of the opposition. And guess what, as two party vice-chairs flounced out in protest, by the end of the week Labour had nudged ahead in the UK polls.Here, after we have fought so hard and effectively to get this far in Scotland, up chirruped Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson. “The Brexit plan opening offer appears so diluted that we would be a vassal state,” he said, as if his seat was a UKIP target. Then, in what looked like a pitch to be Scotland Secretary in PM Bojo’s Barmy Cabinet, he went on to praise David Davis and Johnson for “standing by their principles”.             In the great game of Brexit, councillors like me are but bystanders like everyone else. Others are supposed to be looking after high affairs of state on our behalf as we get on with trying to get the roads fixed and the bins emptied, the licence and planning applications processed, the schools built.The aim for Team May, if I may be so bold, should be to get Brexit over the line, and the word from people a lot closer to this than me beyond the Conservative Party is that the key principles laid out in the Chequers blue-print, like customs alignment for manufactured goods and the end of free movement, are very close to doing just that. But by not seeking to answer every question now, detailed sector-by-sector negotiations can go into a phase where new relationships are forged at the right pace for each. The whips will be working overtime to avoid a defeat on Monday, but I will leave the final word to former Edinburgh councillor and MEP Struan Stevenson, whose poetry on Twitter took a slightly different approach to Ross Thomson:“An MP whose vision was blurred,Was an expert on polishing t**d.But his race to be crownedLeft him running agroundAnd looking faintly absurd...”And, in any case, as they say, you can’t polish a t**d, but you can roll it in glitter...”"},{"url":null,"title":"susan dalgety the party city where only musicians keep time","story":"        New Orleans has a soul like no other place on Earth and not even Mother Nature\u0026#8217s worst storms can break it, writes Susan Dalgety.                Death is everywhere in New Orleans. Its cemeteries, where the dead are buried above the ground because the city sits on water-logged earth, are a wildly popular tourist attraction.            So too are the gaudily painted coffins used at jazz funerals, while grinning skulls hang from the doorways of “authentic” voodoo stores, and the Museum of Death in the French Quarter boasts artefacts from serial killers and grisly crime-scene photographs.            “There have been a number of ‘falling down ovations’ (people fainting) so… prepare yourself before entering,” warns the museum’s website.It is perhaps not surprising that death is as much part of ‘N’awlins’ as Mardi Gras and jazz, given that life here is constant battle with Mother Nature, one that she usually wins.The city is squeezed onto a scrap of fragile land, sandwiched between the mighty Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. Hurricanes batter its shores with crushing regularity, and with much of the city built below sea level, floods are a constant danger.Thirteen years ago, Hurricane Katrina, which claimed nearly 1,500 lives, destroyed half the city’s homes and decimated its population, almost broke its spirit.And the response of the Bush administration, which idled while New Orleans drowned, exposed the mighty US federal government as not only ill-prepared for a disaster that was all too predictable, but hard-hearted, bordering on racist.            It was mostly poor African Americans who were trapped in the city after the deluge, waving frantically from rooftops for help that was slow in coming, or sweltering for days in the fetid Superdome, without fresh water or sanitation. Everyone else had been able to flee.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: A land born of racism and slavery returns to its rootsBut New Orleans has bounced back, as it has done many times since it was established 300 years ago. In a bitter foretaste of its future, the fledgling city was destroyed by a hurricane only four years after the first houses were built.“There is no other city like it in the USA,” explained Cordell, who finally made to the move from LA to NOLA – an acronym for New Orleans, Louisiana – a few months ago.            “I had been coming here a lot to party so, as I can work anywhere, it made a lot of sense to move here.“I have a condo just round the corner,” he went on, waving his bottle of IPA in the vague direction of his French Quarter flat. “It costs me a third of what I was paying in California, and I get all this.” All this is a non-stop party.We met Cordell in a bar frequented by locals, and the occasional wide-eyed tourists wandering in off the street, attracted by the raucous laughter.At four in the afternoon, the party was in full swing. James, squeezed into a silver, sequinned jacket three sizes too small, was drinking Bud from a champagne flute, while handing out stuffed toys from a large bag under his seat.“He always does that, he’s got a big heart,” explained Cordell, who came back from the bathroom with a penguin.            Shortly after we arrived, a roar went round the bar as another regular, rather the worse for wear, announced he was buying everyone a drink. Shots of Jameson were quickly poured in plastic glasses and passed round.Someone shouted, “this is going to be a night to remember!” Cordell shrugged and said, “I am not sure I want to stay forever in New Orleans, maybe there is too much partying. Perhaps I will travel ... Belize, or Spain, or south-east Asia. What do you think of Spain, or Portugal?”And before we could answer, the conversation turned, as it usually does, to “that man”.“I see you have a Baby Trump,” laughed Cordell. “That is a brilliant idea.

I found the kind of freedom I always needed, and the shock of it, against the Puritanism of my nature, has given me a subject, a theme which I have never ceased exploiting.”New Orleans still has the capacity to shock. Bourbon Street after eight o’clock at night is not for the faint-hearted. Poverty still stalks the Lower Ninth Ward where Katrina did the most damage, and violent crime remains stubbornly high.It has been often been described as the worst-organised city in America, where the only people who keep time are the musicians.But it has a soul like no other city. A spirit rooted in the villages of West Africa, the plantations of Louisiana, and the shacks of Treme.The ancient rhythms and heartsick blues of New Orleans have lifted the world, soothed its soul, and made it want to dance.No-one, not even Mother Nature herself, can stop the life force that is N’awlins."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768262.1531468928!/image/image.jpg","title":"progress at north sea s catcher field gives boost to premier","story":"        Premier Oil has hailed progress at a major North Sea field.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney.

Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nSunday 15 Jul 2018 1:38

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.

The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27404  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nThe message must go loud and clear to London that the Backstop agreed in December is the bottom-line. - Mary Lou McDonald TD\nThe Brexit backstop agreed in December is the bottom line and must remain in place, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou has told the President of the EU Commission, Jean Claude Juncker. \nThe Sinn Féin President was speaking after the EU Commission President addressed a joint sitting of the Oireachtas in Leinster House today. \nAlongside the Sinn Féin TDs and Seanadóirí, Sinn Féin MPs and Martina Anderson MEP were also in the Oireachtas chamber for the speech. \nThe EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, was also in the gallery in the Dáil chamber for the speech. \nJean Claude Juncker told the joint sitting that \"Ireland will come first\" in the Brexit negotiations. \nHe also said dismissed the recent proposal from the British government for the backstop agreed in December to apply to Britain, saying it was  designed for the specific circumstances for the north of Ireland. \n\nThe EU Commission President also warned Britain that time is running out to come up with a deal. \"We need more answers and fewer questions,\" he said Oireachtas members and guests. \nMary Lou McDonald described Brexit as \"the biggest threat in a generation to our all-Ireland economy, our peace agreements and to the rights of our citizens\" and added that Ireland must not become collateral damage to the narrow agenda of right-wing British Tories. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said Theresa May and the British government have not put forward any credible proposals and said their approach \"remains littered with long-standing contradictions.\" \n\"The outworking of these unresolved contradictions in British policy is clear.

their homes, schools are destroyed and people are displaced on a daily basis to make way for the construction of these settlements,” he said. \nSinn Féin joined demonstrators from the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign outside Leinster House yesterday to extend their solidarity to the Palestinian people ahead of voting in the chamber. \nWelcoming the historic vote Chairperson of IPSC and Palestinian-Irish citizen, Fatin Al Tamimi thanked Senators who supported the historic Bill and encouraged Senators to continue their support until the the Bill reaches the final stage. \nMs Tamimi said: “We in the IPSC and we Palestinians around the world warmly welcome this historic vote, the first its kind in any Western country. \n“Once again, Ireland is making history and leading the way in its solidarity with the Palestinian people,” she continued. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27415  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nWhat we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry.\nThe people of Derry will take to the streets tonight to challenge what Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has described as the \"warped, negative, regressive , and dangerous\" agenda of those behind the disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of parties and organisations, at Fahan Street/Butcher Gate. \nIt follows several nights of disturbances in the area which included a gun attack on PSNI officers, several blast bombs and dozens of petrol bombs. \nSome of those involved in the disturbances have been young children. \nThe Sinn Féin leader encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s rally to show solidarity with the people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this afternoon alongside Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill as they met with local residents and community leaders and ahead of a meeting with PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, to discuss the violence. \n\nSpeaking to the media at the Gasyard Centre in the Bogside, Mary Lou McDonald said those behind the violence had a \"warped agenda\" and \"cynical, calculated manipulation of young people.\" \n\"What we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry,\" she said. \n\"What we have seen here is a deliberate strategy by those who would style themselves as dissidents to misuse, mislead and manipulate children and to cause fear, hardship and anger across this community. \n\"But they have also created a sense of determination, Because this is Derry and because the Bogside is the Bogside and the people here aren\u0027t having it. This is the city of Martin McGuinness, of John Hume, of civil rights, this is the maiden city, these are proud communities and this evening the people of the Bogside and beyond will come on to the street and stand shoulder to shoulder to face the thuggery, the criminality, the manipulation and the warped thinking of a small, small minority of people who would wish to cause damage here,\" the Sinn Féin leader added. \nMary Lou McDonald also said the local community are angry and that what has happened is not a reflection of the vast majority of local people. \n\"This is every reflection on warped, negative, regressive , dangerous people who think it is OK to manipulate young people and young children to throw petrol bombs and the like for an agenda that is nothing but a road to absolutely nowhere bar anger, fear and destruction,\" she explained. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said the PSNI have a responsibility to keep people safe but laid the blame for the disturbances squarely on dissident groupings. \n\"There is a sense in the community that the police need to do more, that there needs to be a more effective engagement but let me be clear about this, we will talk to George Hamilton about all of those things but be clear here who the instigator of this hardship is, let\u0027s be clear on that. That problem here emanates from so-called dissident elements who are behaving in a manner that no person could describe at any stage to be a republican behaviour,\" she said. \nShe also called on those orchestrating the violence to listen to the voice of the local community and stop immediately. \n\"The important thing is that they listen to the people of Derry because these street, this place is their home, this is where they have grown up, generation after generation, raised their kids, made good lives in what is a fantastic city often in very difficult circumstances and I tell you this, particularly the older residents, have said \u0027we are not having this, nobody every broke us and the dissidents and their sick approach will not break us either\u0027 so I hope they hear that, not from me, but from the people of the Bog.\" \n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2605f.jpg","title":"65077  ","story":"    \nA NEW �10,000 indoor cricket facility has been officially opened at Parkhall Integrated College.\nThe impressive equipment boasts the latest technology in the form of 2G Flicx Pitch floor mats, which have been proven to give the most realistic \u0027bounce and turn\u0027 in an attempt to recreate the most accurate playing conditions in a practice situation.\nAmong those who attended the event were members of Muckamore Cricket Club who hope to take advantage of the facility in the winter months.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2604f.jpg","title":"65078  ","story":"    \nA FOURTH World Superbike Championship is looking ever more likely for local motorbike racer Jonathan Rea after back to back wins in the USA at the weekend.\nRea recorded his first double victory at Laguna Seca in California, extending his championship lead to 75 points with five rounds to go.\nVictory in Sunday\u0027s race was his 62nd career triumph in the series and his eighth win of the season.\nRea, who currently lives on the Isle of Man, dedicated his wins to road racers Dan Kneen and Adam Lyon who were killed in accidents at this year\u0027s Isle of Man TT.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2602f.jpg","title":"65080  ","story":"    \nDISGRACED Antrim councillor Brian Duffin is clinging on grimly to his seat on Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council in the wake of being convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage girl - and despite being asked to step down by his former colleagues in the SDLP.\nThe 73-year-old, who was found guilty of the offence after a contest at Antrim Magistrate\u0027s Court, resigned from the SDLP in February but remains on the Council as an Independent member.\nA Party spokesperson said that the SDLP \u0027unreservedly condemn\u0027 Mr Duffin\u0027s actions and called for him to \u0027resign his seat immediately\u0027.\nMr Duffin has remained tight-lipped after the verdict, saying only: I have notified my solicitor to prepare for an appeal against the decision made against me.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2601f.jpg","title":"65081  ","story":"    \nAN Antrim mum has bravely opened her heart for the first time about the downward spiral of drug abuse that cost her daughter her health - and ultimately her life.\nShaneen Pearce stepped from the crowd at a community drugs meeting this week to tell her own shattering story of the devastating impact dealers dealt to her family.\nLife as she knew it ended when the phone rang just a few days before Christmas 2015.\nHer 24-year-old daughter Tamara had been found dead in a bedroom in Randalstown.

interest in copper barns","story":"\nA unique housing development in Broughshane is attracting interest from international buyers.  \n\n                \nAntrim-based construction company Loft Estates is in the process of completing work on its award winning Copper Barns development, which sits on a 4.5 acre rural site overlooking Slemish Mountain and the Braid Valley. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe £1.3m investment in three state-of-the-art homes, was part funded by Danske Bank. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe company is

Dinsmore, Director at Loft Estates, said: “We have been overwhelmed with the public response to this project which has also received a RICS award for architecture.  \n\n“So far, we’ve sold two homes to legal professionals from London and there have been enquiries from around the world about the third and final property on the development.” \n\nHe added: “The homes are entirely bespoke and whilst they are very contemporary in design, the overall concept works because they relate back to the original stone barns they replaced.  \n\n“We have one barn remaining and will start this in conjunction with the new buyer so they can be involved in customising it to suit their own individual requirements.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n

we have with our Relationship Manager.  \n\n“We operate a number of businesses and a pension fund and Danske Bank really took the time to understand our quite varied needs across this portfolio, so it was an easy decision to switch.”\n\nMichelle Wilson, Business Banking Manager at Danske Bank, commented: “The Copper Barns development is the latest project from Connor and his team and as ever they continue to innovate and excite.  \n\n“A combination of award winning design coupled with quality driven construction has proven to be a winning recipe for the company and we are excited to see what
