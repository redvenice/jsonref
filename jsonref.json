Now firms and government will have to wake up and innovateThe collapse of three major chains last week has put 30,000 retail jobs at risk and triggered fears for the future of town centres. But the picture isn’t all bleak, according to experts including the former government retail tsar, Mary Portas, who says there is too much nostalgia and too little optimism about the future of the British high street.“The days of stacking stuff high and selling it fast are completely and utterly over,” says Portas, who has worked in retail for more than 40 years. “The brands that dominated did that for years and they failed to offer anything beyond mediocrity. Does anyone really miss BHS? Does anyone care about Dorothy Perkins?”On a damp Thursday afternoon in Oxford Circus, shoppers are notably thin on the ground. By Topshop’s entrance, the store DJ desperately mans the decks to meet the brief of creating “a party atmosphere” for customers. A few doors down at Debenhams, shoppers take advantage of sales across all seven floors of the flagship store. Both went into administration last week.“We’re looking at a whole new generation who aren’t going to prop up the likes of Philip Green any more,” says Portas. “They’re not supporting businesses who don’t prioritise people or the planet. We’re moving away from that: there is a new value system at play.”Were it not for the potential job losses, she would be singing good riddance to the dinosaurs of retail. Portas is focused on what she has dubbed “the kindness economy”, wherein she forecasts growth for high streets with an overarching philosophy that involves some kind of contribution to making life better. But what will this translate to?Far fewer shops selling actual goods apparently, and a far stronger focus on the experiential side of things – a catch-all that takes in everything from escape rooms and nail salons, to restaurants and street performers.In town, bricks-and-mortar stores are expected to survive if they’re able to provide something beyond the purely transactional – excellent service that can’t be replicated online, expert knowledge, or a space where people like to get together. Community hubs are frequently mentioned, while brands such as Patagonia, Glossier and Nike are cited as role models for bigger retailers.Research routinely shows that sustainability, innovation and standing for something aren’t just buzzwords for marketers, but the keys to building brand loyalty among younger customers who demand that the companies they buy from show social responsibility. This trickles down to what sticks on high streets, where the most successful will offer a mix of retail, entertainment, culture and wellbeing.From Stoke Newington to Stoke-on-Trent, pop-ups and local boutique businesses are also expected to thrive in high streets with strong local communities. That American Express and Google have both launched campaigns urging customers to shop local and support small businesses underlines where experts predict the future is headed.In Reading town centre, retail expert Mark Pilkington surveys Broad Street, a pedestrianised thoroughfare anchored by John Lewis. “This isn’t bad as modern high streets go: there aren’t too many boarded windows and there’s a strong mix of services – nail bars, phone repair shops and so on. It’s a common mid-market offering.” For retail to survive here, however, he predicts shops will become windows to inventory held online.“It’s pointless to use a store as a glorified warehouses full of stuff when stock can be seen and sold online. The shop floor will shrink and it will be about engaging customers in a way that they can’t experience from their screens,” says Pilkington. While much of this focus seems bent on serving the habits of millennials, generation Z and younger, Pilkington and Portas argue that the overall restructure of the high street will benefit everyone.“Injecting more theatre and excitement into traditional high streets increases their appeal to customers across the board. If you don’t want town centres where skinheads are mugging grannies, you have to make them an attractive place to hang out.”This year, the government created a £95m fund to revive “historic high streets” across England. The scheme, which is being run by Historic England, identified 68 high streets that would be revitalised by the cash injection, but it focuses only on those in conservation areas. The modern-day, identikit every-town high streets blighted by boarded windows, betting shops and rundown discount outlets are also in need of attention.If Pilkington were running a more down-at-heel high street, he would “beautify it with some sculptures and flowers. Have stores that add services or an experience – an alterations service, or repairing electronics. They will be of real value to that community, and you can’t replicate that online.”High streets are also expected to become more residential: under new rules that came into effect in September, it is now possible to convert commercial properties – including vacant shops – into homes without planning permission. The hope is that a high street revival could be ignited by allowing commercial properties to be quickly repurposed.The relationship between businesses and landlords is also expected to change, with rental systems becoming more flexible. In the short term, a number of retailers including All Saints and New Look, are renegotiating their lease terms to push for “turnover-based rents” to reflect the takings of inidual stores. In the long-term, Pilkington says, landlords “must come to the party” if they’re serious about saving the high street.“Leases are too long, too unyielding. Landlords need to be far more innovative and nimble and offer a space that a new business can take on and transform the look of through technology,” says Pilkington. Instead of six months of fitting a store, this way a business would “plug and play”, so that a space could be a pop-up for a well-known brand one day and a yoga studio the next.In his book Retail Therapy: Why the Retail Industry is Broken and What Can Be Done To Fix It, Pilkington argued that the excessive level of business rates was a principal cause of the high street’s long decline. For its post-Covid future, he considers an online tax essential to reform retail.“If local authorities really wanted to save high streets, they would make parking free and readily available. And if government cared about saving retailers, they would impose an internet tax. Amazon pays virtually no business rates.”Portas, who was appointed by David Cameron to lead a review into the future of British high streets in 2011, believes the Conservatives have systematically failed to understand how business has changed.“They need to wake up. It’s shameful that they have still not readjusted their thinking on how Amazon and the delivery giants should be paying equivalent rates of tax online. It’s shameful they’re not doing anything about it. Their slowness in understanding, their tardiness, is ridiculous.“You have these delivery giants clogging up the roads, massively increasing CO2 emissions, increasing packaging, and they contribute so little. Nobody’s actually looked at the implications of what we buy, when we buy, and the effect that it has on the way we live.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07e8b102af50db0ff4e6c7bd53ec4e132082455a/1_0_5624_3375/master/5624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1113d0c6ffa3dac3ba642c23a99596a","title":"eager lenders set to shore up housing market with new loan deals","story":"Prices soared despite Covid, and though hard times and an expiring the tax break are looming, few seem to expect a crashBut the unfreezing of the housing market in May triggered a rush to buy. “We saw people wanting to get on with life, people wanting more space, a garden or a home office,” said Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst at consultancy BuiltPlace. “We’re starting to see that summer boom and all the deals done during that period coming through in the data. We’re going to see the transactions data really spike up over the next few months, and house price inflation is likely to stay high.“These are people who have been unaffected by the pandemic. Their finances are good – maybe even better – and they have a large deposit or equity so are in a good position despite the mortgage market conditions. The cherry on top has been the stamp duty holiday.”The rush to beat the expiry of that tax break, due at the end of March, has crystallised many people’s plans and brought transactions forward. HMRC reported that 105,000 homes changed hands in September, and Hudson said he expected data for the coming couple of months to show between 120,000 and 130,000 deals completed.But we are already at the point where, for people taking out a mortgage and joining a chain of buyers and sellers, the clock is running down on the stamp duty holiday. There have been calls to extend it, but according to Hudson, that would merely delay the crash in transactions that will come once it ends.The next few weeks will see more organisations come out with their predictions for 2021. Expect lots of caveats, and do not bet your house on them coming right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d12e1b1e6c08437db843bc95d09813926a8ea0fc/0_401_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f1ef7536ba2e603809f03a5de3680e08","title":"have you experienced racism at a uk university","story":"We would like to hear from black and minority ethnic students and lecturers about their experiencesA new report has concluded that UK universities perpetuate institutional racism.

They’re wrong. Through careful coaxing and iron patience, I have drilled my cats to stop taking bites out of my mashed potato. They no longer wake me up at the crack of dawn by leaping on to my face. And thanks to my persistence, they are regular, enthusiastic users of the cat flap. Particularly at night when it’s locked and they bash their paws against it like amateur feline bongoists.But this is where my cat-training prowess plateaued – I couldn’t manage to take things to the next level. I did buy a tedious 700-page book that promised feats such as teaching your moggy to sit. I tried random websites’ impressive-sounding tutorials on high-fiving, vaulting and convincing cats to happily don a harness and be walked like a dog. But, invariably, my cats would stray from the plan and I’d be left scouring 800 words of text for a solution. What did my efforts actually teach them? That there’s no better time to steal snacks than when your confuddled owner is staring at his or her phone or into a book. So I gave up.Until today. Now, I am armed with the teachings of School for Cats – a series of TikTok videos, each one around 20 seconds long, making it easy to refer to while training my two beloved feline companions. There’s Mochi, a three-year-old tabby and highly strung madam. Also Poirot, an elaborately moustachioed and insanely rambunctious five-month-old kitten. They’ll be taught separately, though, because – to put it mildly – they are not the best of friends, and it’s difficult to conjure up an informative educational atmosphere in the middle of a fist fight.Day one of training starts well as a super-keen Poirot turns up wearing an elegant tuxedo (which, admittedly, he always does thanks to his black and white fur pattern). But I quickly learn that some of these skills might well be beyond my cats. I’d thought that “lay down” would be the ideal trick to teach a pair of cats that border on narcoleptic. However, when I try gently pushing Mochi into a lying position, she stares balefully at me – her sad, wide eyes dripping with betrayal. Poirot thinks we’re roughhousing, so uses my hand as a scratching post.Another trick, known as “paw” or “shake”, involves getting your cat to give you a high-five by offering them a treat. However, Poirot just ends up biting my fingers until I drop the treat in pain. I move on to the tutorial “over”, in which a compliant cat jumps over an owner’s foot. Mochi, being the contrary moggy that she is, instead learns how to slide under my leg.However, when I find the right trick, I am genuinely astonished by the results. The 360-degree turn that is “spin” is a hit with both of my cats. Not only do they quickly comprehend that they’re meant to follow a treat around in a circle but, after a couple of sessions, they even start following my empty hand in the hope of being rewarded afterwards. Which is the first time I have ever managed to get my cats to do anything without food-based bribery. I mean, if I’m honest, it’s also one of the few times I’ve managed to make them respond to instructions with anything other than a sarcastic narrowing of the eyes. So it’s a double win.What’s more, the training for a trick called “sit pretty” genuinely becomes one of Poirot’s favourite things in the world. Apparently, standing up on his hind legs to reach for a treat is the absolute pinnacle of exciting playtime for a kitten. Hours after one training session, my wife inadvertently points at Poirot during conversation, causing him to leap four feet into the air on to her finger. So successful it is, I’m tempted to rename the trick “fly, my pretty”, or “rocket launch”, or “TAKE COVER! INCOMING CAT!”I’m chuffed. Initially, because the training exercises are a lot of fun. They’re simple to follow, easy to refer to during training and perfect for a creature that has a five-second attention . Plus, they suit the cats.But, eventually, I come to appreciate them for something I hadn’t anticipated. They’ve had lovely consequences for my relationship with my pets. It was fairly predictable that Poirot would take to it, given that he’s an excitable, pliable kitten. But Mochi’s response has been a revelation. She has spent the past two hours sitting next to me on the sofa, just watching me operate a Word document. She’s even begun hopping on to my lap for a snooze – something unheard of since the honeymoon period of her moving in with us. If I’d known that teaching her to spin in circles would make her this content, I’d have done it months ago.Frankly, there’s only one small disappointment in this whole process. No matter how much I scroll, there is one thing I can’t find. Seemingly, School for Cats has no lessons on how to stop your pets playing your cat flap like a bongo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74bc9cfd344ef14f902f863df2c81f4fcabb7856/1425_908_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4448c44920eda0df46b69b9db1f6210c","title":"pause and breathe how i learned to meditate with tiktok","story":"Are you finding it hard to switch off and relax? Short and snappy mindfulness videos were just the thing to help me refocusThings I’m good at: multitasking, overcommitting, starting things and not finishing them. Watching Netflix while listening to a podcast while cooking dinner while messaging a friend, while skim-reading an important article.Things I’m not good at: silence, boredom, focusing on the present, being alone with my thoughts. And so, by extension, meditation.I’ve tried to meditate several times over the years, encouraged by stories from friends and experts about how beneficial it is for our mental health, motivation, confidence and clarity. So far, I’ve never managed to make it more than several minutes into a session without: a) falling asleep b) remembering something very urgent that needs to be done right now or c) allowing my thoughts to wander in such catastrophic directions that it leaves me more stressed than when I started. But if I’m ever going to change that, 2020 seems a good time to try.This year, like so many people, I’ve felt my anxiety skyrocket while my productivity and creativity have plummeted. My silence-aversion and phone addiction have reached new lows (I’m talking watching TV on the toilet), and it often feels as if the only way to coax myself through another working day is offering my brain episodes of Gilmore Girls like dog treats to a wayward puppy.So can I finally learn to be mindful? And could I do so by using the zeitgeist social media platform TikTok? The irony of using social media as a tool to refocus my attention isn’t lost on me. But the truth is that beyond the dance challenges and celebrity lip-syncs, TikTok is fast becoming a hub for short and snappy instructional videos about a variety of subjects and skills.Videos tagged #meditation clock up a cool 643m views. And after the number of adult users multiplied more than six times between October 2017 and March 2019, it is little wonder that lockdown saw an influx of professionals and experts using the platform as a teaching tool.But where to begin? While I’m open to a certain amount of omm and woo (a walk that consists of crossing one foot over the other while hopping), it’s fair to say my tolerance for wind chimes is low. One of the first videos I land on is “meditation tips for witches”, which worries me. If witches are struggling, what hope do us muggles have?Still, TikTok’s pick and mix buffet of content suits my natural impatience. There are as many different ways to meditate as there are users to teach me – I just have to find the one that resonates. So I learn about third eye activation. I experience my first sound bath. I watch absurdly beautiful yogis demonstrating their perfect lotus pose and feel burdened by an extra thought: “How can I get my skin to look like that?” I hope the answer is “by aligning my chakras” and not a serum that costs £300.Then I land on Headspace, and things begin to click into place. An extension of the wildly popular mindfulness app, Headspace’s TikTok is filled with videos delivered in the brand’s signature fluff-free style. Here, instead of a woman walking dreamily through a cornfield or a dandelion clock blowing in the breeze, I can breathe in time to soothing images of fresh linguine falling languidly from a pasta maker. My kind of therapy.Having picked up some beginners’ tips, naturally my first impulse is to multitask. Can I meditate in the shower? While running? At Sainsbury’s? But deep down I know that looking for shortcuts only leads me into a mental cul-de-sac. So I commit to 15 minutes of pure meditation every morning. I sit in an armchair I never normally sit in, and feel slightly more enlightened just by seeing the room from a different angle. Deciding it’s probably best not to start off too ambitious, I begin with the easiest possible exercise: breathing.One myth every instructor I watch seems determined to debunk is the idea that meditation means emptying one’s mind in fact, the goal is to let thoughts pass through without panic or judgment. During my second session, I can’t stop thinking about what I’m going to eat for lunch. But as @lovecolbyjanine reassures me, “distractions can be messages”.Next I discover the Miami-based spiritual coach Estefanía, who posts as @alignwithmee. From her Meditation Hack Tuesdays, I’m thrilled to learn about whistle breathing. Whistling is something I am good at. I’ve often lamented the lack of opportunities for talented whistlers to monetise our skills or harness them for good now I can whistle my way to a higher plane! My downstairs neighbours are thrilled.The next morning I move on to fire meditation, as guided by “spiritual seeker” and author @vishuddhadass. Staring at a candle flame for 15 minutes feels more comfortable than keeping my eyes closed, and with the flickering light to focus on I find that it’s easier to gently bring my mind back each time it wanders. For the first time, I’m disappointed when my meditation ends. For all digital tools, there’s a fine line between companion and crutch. I’ve saved more than 20 videos for future reference, but @whitneycatalano advises that when we find ourselves scrolling the internet in a desperate hunt for more information, that’s when we should turn to meditation instead. “You’re craving connection,” she says. “And information is not the same thing as connection.” Like all good teachers, TikTok can only take me so far before I need to put my phone down and go it alone.After a week of morning sessions, I may not have unlocked bountiful secret reserves of creative energy, but I do notice I’m sitting down to work with less weary apprehension than before. I’ve stopped taking my phone to the loo. And I’ve realised something: successful meditation isn’t like conjuring up the image in a Magic Eye picture. It’s not a knack you grasp, or a hypnotic trance you slip into – at least, not at my amateur level.Rather, it’s a practice, in every sense of the word. The most important thing is being prepared to pause, breathe, and see what happens. Sit with my feelings, as the kids say.It turns out, I wasn’t “failing” to meditate all those times before. I was just giving up before it got good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208c4c7316bbcefac43001292d41c149503dee45/1435_723_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0da95454495fe8554b679e6415dd0d7a","title":"fast and fun learning how tiktok became my fount of scientific knowledge","story":"Are you fascinated by the universe but find in-depth online tutorials on existence a bit long-winded? For one writer, short and snappy videos opened his eyes to a different worldThe worst thing about living in a 3D spacetime continuum is how boring the explanations are for it. Having taken almost a year to finish Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes – an experience that felt longer than the creation of the universe – I’ve always been on the lookout for scientists and cosmic experts who can give me an insight into what this thing we call “reality” actually is.I hoped the internet would allow knowledge to travel at warp-speed, enabling my brain to consume information as easily as black holes do galaxies, but found myself confronting the snore-inducing perorations of science geeks who managed to extend their insights on string theory into infinity. Most video platforms allow their experts too much time to show off their intelligence, but that approach quickly drains my enthusiasm. Luckily if, like me, you like your science fast and fun, the video-sharing network TikTok can be an unexpected starburst of scientific know-how.Using simple hashtags to search for the most useful user-generated videos, my learning began. “Everything is connected!” enthused @kerwinrae over stellar visuals, stating that quantum theory dictates that everything breaks down into “nothing but strings” that are laid down like a web over the entire universe. “Pluck a string on Mars,” he says, “and it’s going to vibrate on earth.” In less than a minute, I realised that God is simply a great guitarist, like an ethereal Jimi Hendrix ecstatically playing everything into being.Over a slow Richard Rodgers jazz song, @physicsdude gave me a quick but very comforting chalkboard introduction to the four basic principles of physical reality – these four being the only reactions that cannot be broken down into simpler reactions. Now I know electromagnetism is the reason everything has a solid structure, while the strong force keeps those crazy quarks in order in the nucleus of an atom the weak force, however, is responsible for all nuclear decay. Gravity, I came to understand, is simply “the curvature of spacetime” – but it could be a particle, though that hasn’t been observed yet.The best thing about TikTok is how it captures the “gee-whizz!” enthusiasm that should accompany the understanding of the universe. Given that it’s the greatest creation of all time, you’d think people would discuss it with more excitement than the wearied waffling that is the usual online lecture. Giving users of Tiktok only 60 seconds to get their messages across really helps the material to be easily digested.Another TikTok user, @weirdpioneer – who describes herself as a wife, mother and psychologist – conveys her awestruck fascination with the universe with a special-effects video of the epigeneticist Bruce H Lipton jiving on the structure of existence. Matter, he enthuses, “is just an illusion of energy and light … there is nothing physical”. Physicists, he argues, have broken down the atom to find that, at its fundamental core, “there is nothing material at all – it’s an energy vortex”. The existential implications of this were mind-blowing. “According to quantum physics,” Lipton says, we’re not physical but merely “energy vortices” – just a flicker of the cosmic light-switch, basically.I was saved from the depression that might have accompanied this recognition of my irrelevance by science communicator Athena Brensberger. She makes sure she is easily comprehensible with short, joyous flashes of insight, such as into the “super position” taken by quarks – those particles that make up the particles that make up atoms.While anything bigger than a quark has to have a fixed location in time and space, quarks can occupy two places at once – until, that is, you observe them, when, like naughty children on being discovered, they stop dead in one place. The fundamental cheekiness of reality – hedging its bets until forced to decide what it is by a grownup – is a bit like my romantic history, and made me relate to the universe a lot more. My commitment issues, I can explain to my next girlfriend, are just the underlying fickle nature of the cosmos playing out through human experience.The universe is a big and complex place, and I’m just a small speck in one tiny corner of it. I could spend my whole life studying, but would only grasp the merest fragment of it.In many ways, TikTok is the ideal platform for a layperson to tackle the big questions of existence, keeping me interested while never pretending to arrive at an answer.

But on a night when Patrick Bamford proved a point against his former employers and Olivier Giroud scored yet again on his first Premier League start of the season, second-half goals from Kurt Zouma and Christian Pulisic were enough to take the Blues for the first time since September 2018.It was not a vintage performance from Frank Lampard’s side in front of 2,000 vocal home supporters, although, after being frustrated by a stubborn Tottenham side last week, the manager was thrilled that his players showed resilience to battle back from behind and leapfrog their London rivals, at least until their derby today at home to Arsenal.“I was nervous of Leeds. But to be that dominant was very pleasing,” he admitted. “It’s early December and there’s a long way to go. But we are moving in the right direction. Our job is to not get caught up in the chat. We have to keep our feet on the ground. There’s a long, long way to go.”This is a rivalry that can trace its genesis back more than 50 years and the infamous 1970 FA Cup final, although it had been eight years since they met in any competition – a 5-1 thrashing for Leeds in the League Cup. Their previous top-flight meeting in May 2004 ended up being the last Premier League match they played until their return this season and also heralded the start of a new era at Chelsea, with Claudio Ranieri being replaced a few weeks later by a certain José Mourinho. Lampard and Marcelo Bielsa’s own enmity is much more recent, of course, and their first meeting since the Championship play-off semi-final when the former was the Derby manager also provided a fascinating subplot. The Leeds manager had insisted that the “Spygate” incident was in the past but he surely would have been delighted to see his side take the lead inside the first four minutes.Chelsea had already gone close when Hakim Ziyech’s shot was saved by Illan Meslier and Giroud’s header from the resulting corner was inches away from creeping inside a post. But in a delightful move that began when Leeds won the ball on the edge of their box, a superb pass from the left boot of Kalvin Phillips allowed Bamford to nip in front of Zouma and apply the finish against his former club.Robin Koch’s departure because of an injury was not ideal for the visitors, although they had Timo Werner to thank for maintaining their lead soon after. Giroud’s header from another corner looked destined for the far corner until the German mysteriously intervened and, with two touches, somehow contrived to hit the crossbar instead.Bamford did not make a single appearance for Chelsea’s first team having joined from Nottingham Forest as a teenager and he came close to scoring his second goal after another free-flowing Leeds move, only for his shot to miss the target. Giroud has also had to wait for his opportunities in west London but underlined his cause further following his four goals at Sevilla in midweek with an immaculate header from Reece James’s cross after good work from Ziyech. That was the winger’s last act, however, as he hobbled off to be replaced by Pulisic, with Lampard later confirming he has a suspected hamstring injury.The American looked keen to make up for lost time after returning from a hamstring injury of his own and, along with Giroud, was the most likely source of a second goal for the hosts. At the other end, Raphinha could not take his chance after Édouard Mendy had saved his initial shot as Leeds continued to pose a danger.But having somehow kept out two efforts from Werner and seen Ezgjan Alioski block another from point-blank range to deny Mason Mount, Meslier could do nothing about Zouma’s header from Mount’s pinpoint corner.Kai Havertz was replaced by Mateo Kovacic to a smattering of applause and an embrace from his manager, who will hope there is more to come from the £62m signing.The impressive Mount was the architect of another swift break that saw Giroud just fail to put the game beyond their opponents’ reach. Werner also spurned a golden opportunity from Ben Chilwell’s brilliant cross that could have settled Lampard’s nerves before Giroud headed over again from a corner.The substitute Ian Poveda-Ocampo could have been awarded a late penalty for Leeds but opted to stay on his feet after seeming to be fouled by Chilwell. “I didn’t see the attack with clarity so it’s hard to comment,” said Bielsa.Leeds paid the price when Pulisic tapped home from close range in injury time to extend Chelsea’s unbeaten run to 16 matches. “We are top of the league,” sang the Chelsea fans. But for how long?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e945da256e0914e80ea6295342db7d086a6a40f/108_69_1549_929/master/1549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57bbfca9a7e950177fb425d7503ae03b","title":"mikel arteta arsenal tottenham goals strikers","story":"The Arsenal manager’s troubles run deeper than a chronic shortage of goals but the derby could offer some respiteAn evening in the life of Mikel Arteta usually involves a stress-relieving walk with his dog, Arnie. Arteta revealed as much this past week and it was a relatively rare insight into the extracurricular pursuits of a manager who, during his first year in the job, has proved adept at answering questions with a smile while giving little away.If only the same could be said for his team. Arsenal have been both hangdog and porous in recent Premier League outings, losing their past three home games and somehow surviving a pounding at Leeds.Something has to change quickly: they are 14th in the Premier League and have not had to gaze this far upwards at Spurs in the week leading up to a north London derby for 27 years. Back then, when Arsenal travelled to White Hart Lane one place off the bottom, they could at least point out it was the second weekend of the season. This time the table is starting to shake down and Arsenal cannot afford to slide further.“This is the game that we have to make into a turning point for us this season,” Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang said in his programme column on Thursday, writing before Rapid Vienna’s visit but dwelling on the trip to Tottenham. “We have to understand that if we can win this game then everyone will change their mindset.”Presumably he meant those in the dressing room as well as the growing minority of outsiders who are wondering whether Arteta’s new broom is what it was cracked up to be. When Arsenal filed on to the Emirates pitch last Sunday the contrast with their opponents’ body language was stark. Wolves, led vocally by Conor Coady, were bolt upright and bouncing on their toes Arsenal and Aubameyang were gazing down at theirs and it was hard not to wonder whether the game had already been half-lost.Not all captains shoot from the hip so it would be unfair to level that flatness entirely at Aubameyang’s door. The problem is that he is hardly firing them in from the boot, either, and that unhappy fact is the headline trend behind Arsenal’s unravelling.Over the past three seasons it has become customary to note the extent to which his brilliance has masked systemic failings, while rarely considering the goals might ever dry up as long as he stayed fit. But he is a week from hitting three months without scoring from open play in the league a nagging concern has become one that threatens to engulf everything and it hastens the pressure on Arteta to evolve the side’s style.The September signing of Thomas Partey, heralded in some quarters as the final piece in Arsenal’s midfield jigsaw, may better be understood as the first. Arteta must continue to squeeze everything from his existing resources for the time being and it was eye-catching to see Ainsley Maitland-Niles, a fine player whose versatility treads a margin between blessing and curse, put in an intelligent and ambitious performance in their deep midfield pairing against Rapid. “I tried to get up and down the pitch and make us more dynamic,” Maitland-Niles said, pointing straight to a quality Arsenal have lacked.Europa League group games are little more than a petri dish for loftier assignments, but the consistency and crispness with which they entertained 2,000 of their returning fans on Thursday felt the most persuasive glimpse yet of Arteta’s ultimate design.Paradoxically, Sunday is probably not the time to release the handbrake. Arteta has guided Arsenal to a win at Old Trafford and Wembley FA Cup triumphs against Manchester City and Chelsea, and an improvement on their now-regular shellacking at Anfield. His insistence upon structure tends to bear fruit when they are not expected to pull their opposition around.It will give José Mourinho a dilemma of his own given Spurs have emerged admirably from their past two games by letting Manchester City and Chelsea come at them. There is an argument Arsenal can be backed more heavily to eke out a result on Sunday than they could be against a Wolves team that looked capable of exposing their home discomforts from the off.Perhaps there is encouragement to be taken by the way Mourinho, albeit with a squad that required fewer adjustments, has overcome a scratchy start to send Spurs dancing to his tune.“Mourinho has something really special,” Arteta said, prompting amusement with his choice of adjective. “Whatever he wants to get into the football club, he manages to do it. He believes in a way and players execute what he wants to do.”There was clear projection into his own vision for Arsenal and, should he outwit his rival, there will be renewed optimism about his ability to fulfil it. Arnie could find himself in for a rather more relaxed runaround, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31cec5a65b8cc136438cc29c0b57113e7d175071/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dab85aef0d32f9adf1de520e7a8bddb2","title":"artist in residence the london home and backdrop of a portraitist","story":"A midcentury house on a wooded hill has been stripped back to its origins to provide both inspiration and a relaxing homeArriving at Curtis Holder’s south London home, I am invited to view what the portraitist smilingly calls his “smoking room”. Neither fuggy nor fusty, Holder’s version of a Victorian gentleman’s hideaway is, in fact, his studio. Holder, who’s currently appearing on the Sky Arts feelgood Portrait Artist of the Year show, designed the welcoming space himself, adding sleek, wood-panelled storage to echo the midcentury feel of his live-work 1960s townhouse where, as he puts it, “Everything has its place.”There was little left of its original architecture when Holder, and his partner, Steve Goggin, a digital content manager for the Historic Royal Palaces, moved here 15 years ago. “At that point we didn’t have a tube station and the area was still affordable,” he says. The cul-de-sac property is set in an estate of modernist properties bordered by quiet woodland. “I used to live nearby, and I’ve always loved this road. I called it San Francisco Way because it’s so wide and the houses are so unusual.”Previous owners had been less enamoured of the property. “There’d been some odd alterations made to the house. At some point, someone had even tiled the facade, which looked very strange,” says Holder. “It felt unloved. We wanted to unpick the mistakes and take it back to its original, midmodern feel. It also had to be practical – somewhere we can work, live and relax with friends in.”Built into a steep hillside, the three-storey house has a layout that allows them to separate work from social life. The top-floor bedrooms, with their wide views, are a sanctuary, where new, built-in storage swallows up clutter. In the main living area below, walls were removed to open up the kitchen, while new doors lead to the garden. In the sitting room, the planners allowed them to install a full-height window, while woodland wallpaper brings the shimmering birch trees of the front garden inside. Elsewhere, popular midcentury designs – a George Nelson bench, silvery Verner Panton lights – and plant-festooned open shelving add to the feel that you have stepped into a 1960s Habitat catalogue, brimming with postwar optimism.One of the few authentic features left inside was the glazed internal wall which brings light to the open-tread staircase. The timber-framed panel, now carefully restored, was inspired by the pioneering glass architecture of nearby Crystal Palace, built to house the Great Exhibition in 1851, which burned down in 1936.There used to be a greenhouse at the side of the house, but it was the worst for wear, so they replaced it with Holder’s second “wet” studio, where he experiments with watercolours, inks or spray painting. The work surface is made of chipboard and the floor is painted with splash-proof resin. Opening the art cupboard brings him particular joy.He works briskly, layering pencils and graphite for the dynamic effect that caught the eye of Sky’s judging panel. “I draw in the moment, putting down what’s happening now. I don’t like to tinker with pieces,” says Holder, who has made it to the semi-finals. Social media inspired him to submit his art to the show’s producers. “My Instagram followers were so supportive. I thought, I’m 52. It’s time to be brave. What can I lose?”Sitters come here for different reasons. “One lady was about to turn 50. She had a list of things she wanted to accomplish. One was to be drawn nude. She was nervous at first. By the end, the power balance had shifted. She was the one who felt in control. I see this all the time.”In summer, he holds drawing classes in the garden for neighbours. “We’re an artistic, friendly community,” says Holder, who is also a part-time teacher at a local primary school. All the art or design in the house has a personal connection. A studio stool is by Assembly Room, whose husband-and-wife founders live a few doors down Holder swapped his own art for the prints and paintings by Alex Mein and his nephew, Jethro Syder-Spence. A large abstract is by Don Hutson, the father of a school friend. “He was the first artist I ever met. I’d go to their house and gaze at his paintings, wondering if I could ever have a career in art.”Growing up on an estate in Leicester in the 1980s, Holder, a graduate of Central Saint Martins, remembers how his mother, a nurse, would answer his boyish questionings with accomplished drawings. “She would talk and draw – plant roots, clouds – to explain how things worked. We communicated through mark-making.”Art school, however, was not on the family radar. A character in EastEnders changed all that. “Colin was an artist, he was gay, he had a flat – and a boyfriend. I thought, there’s a living to be had in this world of art.”Discussions about Portrait Artist of the Year are embargoed (the winner is announced on 16 December), but he plans to put his appearance to constructive use. “The art world is often perceived as a erse land of milk and honey. The reality is that it’s still white and male-dominated. What prevents people from breaking into that world is visibility. If you don’t see yourself represented, you’ll think there’s no way in. I’d like to take my story to as many children as possible and say, you can survive as an artist. It’s like any other job, you have to work hard. But it’s as real as becoming a doctor. I want to show others that art can be a career, and a way of life.” curtisholder and @curtisartist Portrait Artist of the Year is on 9 December at 8pm on Sky Arts, Freeview Channel 11"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a683e751e45c292c578d4997ff581b8752fb8c8/0_110_1586_951/master/1586.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d7c6a342b79514edb1ea7c06b9267857","title":"how to have a covid safe christmas","story":"Families across the UK are being allowed to gather over Christmas, even as tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases are recorded each day.

Here’s his report on a sad situation.There is one odd thing about this unfolding story. Only one of the players has tested positive since the teams last met – the unnamed South African whose test led to the first game in the series being postponed from Friday to tomorrow. While wishing the two hotel staff a speedy recovery, I’m surprised that their predicament has stopped the game.Dozens of football clubs have managed to fulfil their fixtures with a player or two self-isolating. As far as we know, neither England nor South Africa have an outbreak in the dressing-room, as Newcastle United did on Friday when their match against Aston Villa was postponed. So there’s an element of mystery as well as disappointment. But the South African board will not have abandoned the match lightly – they need the broadcasting revenue, which is thought to be around £3m for this three-match series.Today’s game has been abandoned, according to the host broadcaster, quoted by Ian Ward on Sky Sports and confirmed by Ali Martin on Twitter. Ward and his colleague Nasser Hussain are saying that the tour may well be abandoned too. The two of them are standing in the middle of a ground that’s even emptier than usual. The weather is lovely, the view is gorgeous, and the outlook is grim.Covid strikes again! Two members of staff at the hotel in Cape Town where both teams are staying have tested positive. My colleague Ali Martin is saying on Twitter that the England squad have been tested again and the results are still awaited. Neither team is at the ground in Paarl and the hotel is an hour away, so there’s plenty of time for a leisurely breakfast.Tim will be here shortly.

England’s players were on the two team buses, about to enter the gates at Newlands.With concerns from the tourists about the integrity of the biosecure bubble set up at the Vineyard hotel, where the two teams are staying in separate wings and barred from mixing socially, Cricket South Africa ordered a fresh round of Covid tests for their players on Friday evening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03f5aedb497a8a61c5cf58d7e01d3e0d18939cab/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca3ddb52ced0196d76f8881b5b083f5f","title":"best tech of 2020 an eco vacuum electric car and a 12 kettle","story":"The consumer group Which? chooses its top 50 gadets of the year, from cheap and cheerful to high endA robot vacuum that deals with the unpleasant job of emptying the dust bag, a swivelling selfie camera for the YouTube generation and a £12 kettle are among an eclectic list of items dubbed the best products of the year.Experts from the consumer group Which? have picked out 50 items for special praise from the 3,500 reviewed or released over the last year, focusing on their innovation, sustainability or value for money.The most quirky item on the list was the iRobot Roomba s9+ vacuum cleaner. While pricey at £1,500, the group said that it is “not only excellent at cleaning, earning a full five stars in this category of Which? testing, but it also empties its own dust bag”. Ridding its owner of the grubby job was innovative enough to win a top 50 place. Its reviewers concluded: “Can you put a price on time saved? Probably, but if you want a fantastic robot vacuum cleaner and are happy to pay a lot for it, then the Roomba offers brilliant cleaning and a few tricks up its dust bag.”A list including the latest in electric car technology and luxury vacuums also included some top tips for the thrifty. At number 47 in the list was Asda’s George Home Cream Kettle GPK201C-19, costing just £12. While reviewers concluded it was “a bit noisy”, they said its stylish and simple appearance made it a top buy. “For £12, you’d expect a drab lump of plastic but Asda’s bargain is simple, stylish and boils water fast enough to make a tray of teas in an ad break,” said the testers. “It makes a racket doing it, so don’t boil when your show’s on, but for £12 it’s phenomenal value.”The cheapest product in the top 10 is a wireless security camera, the TP-Link Kasa KC200. The £69 camera performed almost as well as more expensive competitors, despite costing two-thirds less.At number one in the list were Apple’s AirPods Pro. The £219 earphones were praised for improving on the basic model “in every way”, adding that it was “remarkable that tiny earpods can create such versatile, powerful and spatial sound”. They said that the addition of a rubber earpiece had not only provided a better fit but also ensured the wireless headphones were more difficult to lose. Replacements cost £85 each.It was a big year for vacuums. Second in the overall list was the Halo Capsule, a £249 recyclable cordless vacuum that comes with enough capacity and extra disposable bags “to fill a bathtub with dust”. Reviewers were impressed by the fact that every part of the carbon-fibre product is recyclable. Every two years, a full service allows the old battery to be recycled and replaced, an innovation described as “a significant step forward for sustainability”.The podium is completed by the Kia Soul, an electric vehicle praised by experts for its long-range and efficient battery – and yours for only £37,295. The car managed to cover 242 miles in tests, enough charge to drive from London to York and enough power left to scope out a parking spot.Scraping into the top 50 was the Sony ZV-1 camera. The £699 camera has a swivelling “selfie display”, which the group said made it the perfect choice for vloggers “who want to look perfect for their next YouTube upload”. It praised its video quality as “superb”.Harry Rose, editor of Which? magazine, said: “Apple’s new AirPods Pro edged out some fantastic contenders by taking a product that was already exceptional and improving it to the point of near-perfection. It is a huge task to sift through the thousands of products Which? tests each year and whittle it down to just 50 – but this year’s list showcases the very best in high-tech gadgets, advances in sustainability and value for money products, proving there are great buys out there for anyone prepared to do their research.”The list is just as eclectic as last year’s top 10, which included an Ikea mattress, Amazon’s Kindle and a recyclable travel cup.Apple AirPods Pro (£219) “Wireless in-ear headphones described as Apple’s pinnacle of in-ear headphones for its noise-cancelling abilities, lack of sound leakage and incredible sound.”Halo Capsule (£249) “Carbon-fibre bagged cordless vacuum thoughtfully made to be recyclable, includes biodegradable bags and battery replacements.”Kia Soul (£37,295) “Fully electric vehicle from Kia which was found to travel 242 miles on a single charge in an independent Which? test.”Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G (£1,200) “A mobile phone that has more memory than most laptops, five high-tech lenses and an interface so responsive, experts said it feels like the device is ‘reading your mind.’”LG OLED48CX6LB (£1,489) “A 48in OLED TV from LG, considered to be one of the best.

Across England, scotch egg makers are ratcheting up production lines after seeing demand from pubs and the food-service sector rise massively over the past week.“For us, it’s been great – the phones have been ringing non-stop,” said Brendan Baury of Bolton-based gourmet scotch egg maker Happy Belly.Sales began to surge on Monday, when food minister George Eustice said that a scotch egg – typically a boiled egg encased in cooked sausage meat and fried breadcrumbs – did count as a “substantial meal”. Then Michael Gove, who had initially contradicted his cabinet colleague and dismissed the scotch egg as “probably” just a starter, backtracked on Tuesday and declared, once and for all, that a scotch egg “definitely” is a substantial meal.Hospitality businesses in tier 2 areas welcomed the news: under the government’s new Covid-19 restrictions, which are enforced by local authorities, a “substantial meal” must accompany all alcoholic drinks that they serve – meaning many pubs and bars without kitchens would have struggled to reopen after the national lockdown ended in England on Tuesday.Now, publicans are hoping they need only supply customers yearning for a freshly drawn pint with a cold scotch egg alongside their tipple of choice, to stay on the right side of a quintessentially British law.Happy Belly normally produces about 10,000 scotch eggs a week, said Baury. This week he has made 15,000 following a huge increase in enquiries from new customers, particularly kitchenless pubs.“In the region of 150 pubs, restaurants and food-service companies have got in touch with us about supplying them since Monday,” he said. His production line will now be running for 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week, to meet demand. “We’re expecting orders to be even higher next week. It’s brilliant for the staff, because we haven’t had to furlough anybody, and everybody’s working extra hours so they’ve got some good cash coming in before Christmas.”Images and repeated discussions about scotch eggs on the news have also helped to drive up sales by putting the old-fashioned delicacy front and centre of people’s minds this week, according to Peter Nutt, who runs Nutts Scotch Eggs in Weston-super-Mare. “I think there was subliminal advertising going on.

It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it. The internet. But,\u0026nbspas we have said before and will say again,\u0026nbspshopping online comes with a caveat. As much as 70 per cent of Irish consumers’ virtual spending leaves the country as people shop overseas.It doesn’t have to be that way. As we are learning, there are many, many local sites that need our support this month and every month. If we could keep just 10 or 20 per cent of our online spend this year at home it would inject tens of millions of euro into our local economies. That would save jobs and keep businesses going.So our 100 became 200, and is now becoming 400.Jump to: Toys Food and drink Art and gifts Jewellery Clothes Books Music and tech Sporty stuff Health and beauty Everything elseTOYS nimblefingers.ie  A Dublin toyshop that has been making children and their parents happy for generations.

Photograph: Ludovic MarinAFP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Clément Beaune has a framed photograph of himself with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar in his office. Photograph: J SaragoIn the autumn of 2001, a young French student called Clément Beaune arrived at Dublin airport to begin a year’s study at Trinity College under the EU’s Erasmus scholarship programme. It was Beaune’s first trip to Ireland and the taxi driver pointed out historic sites, including the General Post Office.“He showed me the bullet holes in the walls and he told me it was the fault of the English, but it wasn’t sad or aggressive, just a sort of daily memory,” Beaune recalled on Friday, sitting in his office overlooking the Seine at the French foreign ministry.The same office was once occupied by Michel Barnier, one of Beaune’s predecessors who is now the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator.President Emmanuel Macron promoted Beaune, aged 39, to Minister of State for European Affairs in July. He earlier served as Macron’s European adviser at the economy ministry, during Macron’s presidential campaign, and for more than three years at the Élysée.Beaune could not understand the accent of that Dublin taxi driver back in 2001, yet he still sees him as typically European. “A sort of obsession with history, without being paralysed by it. One is truly European when one combines precise memories of history with a strong projection towards the future.”Beaune lived with Irish and other European students in a rundown house at the Seapoint Dart station. “Sometimes it was like camping. The heating didn’t work and there was rarely hot water. Real student life. It was for me a year of joy and freedom,” he says.The 911 terrorist attacks cast a pall over the world then. But at the same time, the Celtic Tiger was peaking. Dublin grew before Beaune’s eyes. The ambience was intensely hopeful. “There was great pride when Ireland was in the first wave to enter the euro with Germany and France, without Britain... For my Irish friends, Europe meant mutual support, modernity, a positive spirit. I was very struck by their European enthusiasm. I developed a European conscience in Dublin.”Beaune has a framed photograph of himself with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar in his office. They met when Varadkar attended one of Macron’s presidential campaign rallies in 2017. Then ambassador Geraldine Byrne-Nason introduced them, because both had attended TCD.“Clément Beaune is the essential contact for European diplomats in Paris,” says Ambassador Patricia O’Brien. “He is a convinced European with immense energy and a profound grasp of all the issues. And he has a talent for making the most complex dossiers understandable. Macron relies on him totally, so talking to Clément is like talking to the president. His affection for Ireland is a bonus for us.”Beaune met Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney in Paris for the first time on Thursday night. Their time together was devoted to negotiations on the post-Brexit relationship between the EU and the UK. “We were in total convergence on everything,” Beaune says.The French, like Ireland, still hope for agreement in London. Neither country “will sacrifice the essential interests of our fishermen, who did not have a vote, on the altar of the Brexit referendum,” Beaune warns. He admits that France has played “the role of bad cop” for four and a half years of Brexit negotiations. They did it in Europe’s interest, he says, implying that Europeans need to learn to be more tough.“Europeans are sometimes excessive facilitators, who seek agreement at any price. They want to be sympathique with everybody,” Beaune explains. “There’s a European syndrome of benevolent culpability, as if we had to be in a sort of permanent compromise. It’s in our DNA as Europeans, but it’s also in our European DNA not to be ashamed of defending our values, our rules and our interests.”For Beaune, the approval of the €750 billion recovery fund on July 21st was the most historic development in Europe since the single currency. It started with a letter calling for the creation of shared European debt and signed by France and eight other countries, including Ireland, in March.Dublin had earlier associated itself with the so-called Hanseatic League of northern countries who oppose further integration. So Ireland’s decision was an important shift, says Beaune, which “played a role in the perception of our struggle, because Ireland is not lax in terms of public finance. It gave credibility to our demarche . . . It was a very strong message which said, ‘We know what European solidarity is and we want to strengthen the mechanisms of solidarity and protection in this new crisis.’ At least that was how the Irish message was received.”Beaune acknowledges that “France sometimes has the image of going it alone, and of arrogance. It would be arrogant to say we’ve done everything right, but since 2017, President Macron has changed method. He really wants to talk to everyone.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Scotland lockdown: what are the new Covid rules and Tier 4 restrictions?Covid-19 vaccine: Latest updates on Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer breakthroughs - and who will get it first?Comment: On the public health establishment\u0026#39s dystopian logic, every flu season should bring another lockdownJuan Guaido prepares to lose his seat in Venezuela - and his freedomCoronavirus latest news: Half of Britons will wear mask after getting vaccineSurfer escapes shark attack in South AustraliaComment: There is only one way to stop the woke takeover of Britain’s elite institutionsWorld\u0026#39s fastest-growing jihadist insurgency is bringing Land of the Upright Man to its kneesHalf of Britons won\u0026#39t throw away masks after getting vaccinated, poll revealsComment: Imperial and out-of-touch, Giscard D’Estaing embodied the pompous EU eliteJapanese space probe may answer questions about solar system\u0026#39s origins after landing in Australian outbackDonald Trump holds first rally since US election and repeats false claims that vote was \u0026#39rigged\u0026#39Blackpool man charged with attempted murder of baby girlMicrowave \u0026#39attack\u0026#39 may have caused mystery illnesses of US diplomats in Cuba and ChinaNetflix refuses to warn viewers of The Crown that series is historically inaccurateBrexit Day 2020: When is the UK due to leave the EU and how will it happen?What no-deal Brexit means, how it might happen, and how it might affect daily life in the UKBrexit deal: what has been agreed, and what happens next?\u0026#39Mass trespass\u0026#39 at StonehengeGovernment to crack down on \u0026#39barbaric\u0026#39 shark fin trade after BrexitBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bashir inquiry judges family links bbc","story":"The former judge in charge of the inquiry into how Martin Bashir secured an exclusive interview with Princess Diana has strong family links to the BBC, the  can reveal.Lord Dyson\u0027s brother-in-law, David Levy, who attended Dyson\u0027s swearing-in as a High Court judge, was in charge of public policy and regulation at the BBC until 2007. And in 1995, the year of the Princess Diana interview, he was head of policy development. Before then Mr Levy worked on a number of BBC programmes, including Newsnight. Princess Diana\u0027s brother Charles Spencer has accused reporter Bashir of falsifying documents to allegedly coerce Princess Diana into appearing on Panorama. The BBC promised to investigate the matter, and Prince William released a statement saying he hoped the investigation would get to the truth of the matter.Last week Lord Dyson, who was appointed by the BBC to investigate the Panorama programme, said he intended to conduct a full independent inquiry and called for all witnesses to come forward who have knowledge of the interview. But the former judge\u0027s family links to the BBC raises the perception of a conflict of interest. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told the Sunday : The whole point of an independent inquiry is that it should be above reproach. A perception of a conflict of interest like this casts doubt on the validity of inquiry’s outcome before it has even started.In his memoir, A Judge\u0027s Journey, Lord Dyson, the former Master of the Rolls and a former Justice of the Supreme Court, describes his brother-in-law as having a \u0027glittering career\u0027 at the BBC.Mr Levy worked for the BBC for 20 years and was a senior BBC executive responsible for public policy as well as leading on the Corporation\u0027s charter and licence fee negotiations with the government.He is not the only member of Lord Dyson\u0027s family to have worked for the BBC. Lord Levy\u0027s Great Uncle \u0027Emil\u0027 whom he also writes about in glowing terms in his memoir also worked for the BBC in the war and for the BBC World Service after the war.Last night the BBC said that Mr Levy was not in an editorial role at the time of the time of the interview in 1995.A BBC spokesman said: “Lord Dyson is an eminent and highly-respected lawyer who was Master of the Rolls and a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, and it is on that basis that the BBC Board has appointed him to chair its independent investigation.”Mr Levy, an Emeritus Fellow of Green Templeton College at Oxford University, told the Sunday : I did work at the BBC between 1987 and 2007 but my last editorialjournalistic role there was as Editor of Analysis on Radio 4 from 1992-4. Thereafter I left News \u0026amp Current Affairs and worked in a series of outward-facing Public Policy roles with no editorial involvement or responsibilities.Mr Levy said he had no knowledge of the Princess Diana interview other than what was reported in the media at the time. He had not spoken to Lord Dyson about the Diana interview and did not expect to be called as a witness to the inquiry. A representative for the inquiry, on behalf of Lord Dyson, directed all enquiries to the BBC.As a judge Lord Dyson also had contact with the Royal Family. In his memoirs, Lord Dyson complains that when he was called to meet the Queen to be made a Knight of the Realm, he wasn\u0027t \u0027excited\u0027 and would have rather stayed in Sheffield hearing cases. He said that he was \u0027frustrated\u0027 that instead he had to give up a day of enjoyable work for a \u0027fleeting exposure of the glamour of Buckingham Palace\u0027 and couldn\u0027t understand why he wasn\u0027t allowed to take his wife. He complains that a Royal flunky accused of being late for his audience when he says he wasn\u0027t.However, he says he was \u0027disarmed and charmed\u0027 by the Queen during his ten-minute audience which was ended when she pressed the bell. He described her as gracious and more beautiful than he had expected. In 2007 Lord Dyson was one of three judges who ruled in favour of the BBC in a legal case concerning \u0027cash for honours\u0027 when the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith blocked the Corporation\u0027s attempt to report on the affair. Lord Dyson also sat as a judge on the Court of Appeal case which in 2014 ruled in favour of publishing Prince Charles\u0027 spider letters. Prince Charles said he was disappointed with the ruling.

An internal panel, chaired by the school\u0027s vice-provost, will meet next week to consider Mr Knowland\u0027s appeal.But Mr Francis, who left Eton last year to set up a network of low-cost independent schools called Scholar 6, has warned that the outcome of the appeal panel will undermine Eton\u0027s head and provost whichever way it goes.Writing in The , he said: Knowland, with heavyweight support from two Harvard professors, has won key intellectual arguments.If his refusal to take down a video lecture about masculinity is deemed gross misconduct, he becomes a martyr to hundreds of boys, thousands of Old Etonians and millions of random bloggers. If the dismissal is overturned, Eton\u0027s leadership teeters on the edge of farce.Professor Steven Pinker, an expert in experimental cognitive psychology at Harvard University, has written to Eton\u0027s provost in support of Mr Knowland.In the name of honest and rigorous discussion of ideas, and respect for the ability of Eton students to evaluate and debate them, I urge you not to fire Mr Knowland, he said.Richard Wrangham Moore, a research professor of biological anthropology at Harvard, also wrote to Baron Waldegrave of North Hill saying he was astonished to learn of Mr Knowland’s dismissal.Prof Moore argued that the school\u0027s actions threatened Eton\u0027s reputation for openness, intellectual honesty, scholarly courage, and promotion of independent thought.Mr Francis, who used to be head master at Hampton Court House, said it was a mistake to insist that Mr Henderson remove the video.By instructing Knowland to withdraw his lecture, he undermined the principle of controversy behind the Perspectives course, he said. Knowland dug in and secured the higher ground.Former and current pupils have criticised Eton for dismissing Mr Knowland, with more than 2,000 signing a petition that accused the school of institutional bullying. But some parents have come to Mr Henderson\u0027s defence, saying that he has their total support and accusing Old Etonians of launching a smear campaign against him.Earlier this week, a current Eton master resigned one of his positions in protest and broke ranks to attack the school\u0027s indoctrination of students.Dr Luke Martin, who teaches Divinity at the 580-year-old institution, recently stood down from his role as the master in charge of Perspectives and said he was beginning to lose faith in Eton\u0027s ability to promote independent thinking among pupils.An Eton spokesman said: The school was advised by a specialist barrister that the content in Mr Knowland\u0027s video lecture – which appeared online with a reference to his employment at Eton – could very well breach a number of the school\u0027s policies as well as the school\u0027s legal and regulatory obligations. That gave the school no choice but to ask for it to be taken down. The school asked Mr Knowland to remove it, pending further discussion. He refused several requests to do so. A second lawyer conducted an independent investigation into his conduct, which led to a disciplinary hearing heard by a panel of senior teachers which did not include the head master. It determined that the teacher\u0027s actions represented gross misconduct which should result in dismissal.

Not because wants the attention, of course (or to jump to the head of an inoculation queue he’s otherwise not in) but to boost confidence in take-up of the PfizerBioNTech jab being rolled out here next week. Being ahead of Europe and America in greenlighting the jab has caused some skepticism, but it must be nice for the Government to get approval for something.And so, ever generous with his (air)time the Health Secretary has gone one further this time, agreeing to receive his first dose on Good Morning Britain alongside Piers Morgan . The race to become vaccine posterboy is not limited to British daytime TV, either: in the US George Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are offering up an ex-White House televised jab triptych.Perhaps all this public offering of flesh is a good thing the NHS was earlier this week rumoured to be compiling a list of “sensible” celebrities and influencers to convince the vaccine-hesitant, after all. If they really want to encourage people, the wan bingo wings of middle-aged politicians seems relatively unlikely to do it – especially when so many more compelling options abound. For example:Maureen from BarnsleyLike the Man from Delmonte and Jenny from the Block, 83 year-old Maureen – who earlier this year went viral after telling the BBC that she didn’t “give a sod” about impending Tier 3 restrictions – is iconic enough to have no need for a surname. Age-appropriate woman of the people? Sign her up.“What if every one of us was a raindrop?” “What is the point in bringing a new person into this world when they get to your age and it’s on fire?” (Nonsensical) questions for the ages posed by Prince Harry this week. Having him engage in something normal at this point would make for “good optics”, as LA-types say. And if he wants to get vaccinated in front of a backdrop of gently sloshing recycled rainwater, so be it.Along with Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster, the quiet disappearance of Dr Jenny Harries OBE – you remember, the country’s deputy chief medical officer? Bob, glasses? – has become an unanswerable mystery. Where have they taken you, Jenny? Can you hear us where you are? The Government may think pandemic substitute Jonathan Van-Tam’s novelty ties are a fitting distraction, but no dice. At least the broadcast of her having the jab will cost less than the search party.This one would work competition style – highest bidder gets to stab Cummings in the arm live on national TV (screaming “THIS ONE’S FOR BARNARD CASTLE!” while so doing is optional). All money raised to go back into the shrivelling economy, and buying the man a new gilet.Along with “substantial meal”, “wet pub” and “new normal”, the Scotch egg has unfortunately become the latest two-word utterance rendered entirely unbearable from overuse. The only appropriate means of dealing with the fact civilisation has this week come down to a third rate picnic snack is by putting it together on-screen with the vaccine the force field emanating from the two greatest symbols of British freedom in one frame will be magnetic.Cases of Covid among twentysomethings have halved in recent weeks – the fastest age group to see such a drop (alongside those in their seventies). Which is good news, of course it is. Yet somehow feels crueller, on another all but locked-down weekend in which those of us in that tranche may still only mix with five friends or relatives on a sleet-covered park bench.There is no question that the most devastating effects of the pandemic have been on those who have lost lives, and livelihoods. But so much life has been lost, too – crystallised again during November’s restrictions, during which three of those closest to me celebrated their 30th birthdays. Looking back now, what we thought were dialled-down jollies in the summer – a barbecue for eight in August, then a rule-of-six pub gathering in September – now seem fanciful in the last three weeks I have watched one birthday girl grainily blowing out candles on Zoom, been sent a WhatsApp picture of the next receiving brownies I’d had sent, and last Saturday a quiet dinner for two, no friends, no fanfare. Losing these milestone moments doesn’t matter, I know, in the bigger picture. But it is still sad that the “roaring twenties” of so many continue to evaporate with a squeak. We’ll be living in a “different world by summer,” Boris Johnson promised a few days ago. Maybe next year, 31 will be the new 30.Grant Shapps charitably added no new countries to the travel corridor this week. But if you’d like to feel your mind transported as far away from reality as possible let us journey to Islamabad, where Cher has been busy securing freedom for the “world’s loneliest elephant.” After 35 years in confinement, Kavaan is now heading off to a new life in Cambodia following a balloon-strewn farewell ceremony, a diet plan that’s seen him shed 450kg in three months and primed to shack up with three lady elephants on arrival (by plane!) in his new 25,000 acre pad frankly, it feels as if Kavaan is having a better 2020 than the rest of us. Either way, good on him – and on Cher, for her surprise involvement in this pressing task. It’s not quite Dolly Parton funding the Moderna vaccine, but she’s done her hit.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"full search british hiker esther dingley could delayed spring","story":"A full air and ground search for a missing British hiker could be delayed until snow set to cover the mountain this weekend has melted in the spring, officers hunting for her have admitted.Esther Dingley, 37, was reported missing by her partner, Dan Colegate, after failing to return from a solo walking trek in the Pyrenees on November 25.Her last message was via WhatsApp from on top of Pic de Sauvegarde, on the France-Spain border, three days earlier. Officers are treating the disappearance as a missing persons case and launched a desperate search operation for Ms Dingley, an Oxford graduate. However, the week-long search, involving helicopters, dogs and around 15 experts from several Civil Guard elite mountain rescue units, was halted on Thursday due to bad weather. The mystery threatened to deepen further on Saturday when a new witness came forward, claiming to have spotted Ms Dingley hiking up a mountain trail on the day she was last seen. Marti Vigo del Arco, a Spanish Olympic skier, told a Barcelona newspaper he and his girlfriend had seen the British hiker at around 3pm and thought it was late in the day to be climbing the Pic de Sauvegarde. It was just before 4pm that Ms Dingley had sent a selfie to her partner from the summit of the mountain.“She was coming up, we were on the descent, she was very heavily loaded with a very big backpack,” Mr Vigo del Arco told Spain’s La Vanguardia newspaper. “She asked us if we had a piece of fruit or something fresh, but we didn’t have anything,” said Vigo del Arco. “She carried on up.”The couple did not see anyone else coming up the mountain and may have been the last people to have seen Ms Dingley.Rescue teams have no plans to go out this weekend due to freezing temperatures affecting the peak from which Ms Dingley sent her last message, which is 8,983ft above sea level. They were also forced to abandon searching the village of Benasque, where she had left her car before embarking on the final leg of her journey.Sergeant Jorge Lopez Ramos, the head of the Civil Guard mountain rescue team in Benasque, admitted that the operation may not resume with the same intensity until next spring.He said: We appreciate the chances of finding Esther alive are minimal and it leaves us with a very bitter taste in our mouths. We have not found anything at all in any of the areas we\u0027ve searched that might help us discover where Esther is.The weather has changed and the search finished on Thursday. In principle, if the adverse weather conditions continue as we expect, then we\u0027ll have to stop the search until we have a better idea of where we should be looking.The snow will cover the mountain and it\u0027s possible that it won\u0027t disappear until the spring. That means it\u0027s possible the search can\u0027t resume with the same intensity we\u0027ve seen so far until the spring.Ms Dingley and Mr Colegate have been travelling around Europe in a van for six years after quitting their jobs and selling their home in Durham. Other Civil Guard units, including specialists in telecommunications, are believed to have been asked to investigate Ms Dingley\u0027s disappearance. Although they have remained tight-lipped about the work they are doing, they have privately dismissed the idea that she could have been attacked by a bear.They have made no comment on reports they are hunting a man travel blogger Esther said in her online travel diary had given her a lift down from the mountains in the days before she vanished.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"germanys prevarication huawei 5g bleak news free world","story":"It’s a typical German solution which attempts to smother the difficult choices in complex procedures,” Martin Schallbruch, a former German official, told Noah Barkin of the German Marshall Fund this week. No, he wasn’t talking about Brexit, but about Germany’s decision on whether or not to let Huawei build its 5G network.After more than a year of prevaricating in an attempt to see off a powerful anti-Huawei alliance between her backbenchers and her coalition partners, Angela Merkel is ready to win in her usual way: obfuscate. According to Mr Barkin, Berlin’s almost-final policy proposal is now being circulated amongst its ministries and, in the words of an anonymous current official it “leaves everything wide open”.In effect, this is a victory for Beijing. The document details all sorts of procedures for what to do if various ministers can’t agree and vaguely tries to define untrustworthy suppliers, but ultimately resolves that if there isn’t a consensus, the status quo wins. In other words, Huawei stays.You can point out the hypocrisy of a country preaching about privacy rights and the transatlantic alliance while allowing a telecoms champion from a totalitarian country to build its communications infrastructure, but it doesn’t matter. German companies are, for the moment, still making too much money exporting to China for their government to risk upsetting the applecart. This is bleak news for the free world.On the bright side, it does make the UK look thoroughly decisive. This week, the government published its plans to phase out Huawei kit from September next year and incentivise the development of more alternative suppliers. One step at a time.Philip Green’s retail empire, which owns Topshop, went into administration this week. The Covid lockdowns were just the final straw for a business suffering from years of bullying leadership, under-investment and technophobia. Still, having grown up in the late 90s and early 2000s, I find it hard to compute that the mighty Topshop is fallen.For a teenage girl during the heyday of bands like the Libertines and Slipknot, Topshop was the definitive marker of hip. Its cavernous Oxford Circus store had the mysterious ability to turn “dowdy” into “retro” or “tacky” into “original”, cladding its skinny adolescent shoppers in flowery dresses and patent leather shoes, silk blouses, fake fur and fake lizard skin, leather jackets covered in zips, beaded vests dangling silver tassels, plastic bug-eye sunglasses, leopard-print headbands and garish jewellery.It was the shop that told you it was actually a good idea to buy cheap shoes off a hanger or don a felt trilby, to wear a faded SpongeBob SquarePants t-shirt with a gold sequinned miniskirt or to sport a pink tutu alongside huge army boots and a faux-military jacket. As someone who hardly dared to do any of these things and found the obligatory effort to haul on drainpipe jeans behind a flimsy curtain in its changing cubicles positively harrowing, its influence was frankly oppressive. But it was supreme.So now what? Someone will presumably buy the brand and hopefully save some of the 13,000 jobs at risk. But the old days are gone. Actually, I don’t miss them.“UK Says It Won Vaccine Race by Being a ‘Better Country’,” was the Bloomberg headline beamed around the world. Look, I’m all for politicians being patriotic, but the painfully half-smiling Mr Williamson doesn’t sound patriotic. He sounds like a semi-grown Draco Malfoy who went into politics and then realised he had to say things that might appeal to normal people.He has form, you see. In 2018, after the Skripal poisonings, he famously showed Putin who was boss by telling Russia to “shut up and go away”. Last year, sacked as defence secretary for allegedly leaking from a national security briefing, he claimed that he, like, seriously “did not” and we should believe him because “I swear on my children’s lives”.There’s a market for politicians who can encapsulate an everyman philosophy in a catchy phrase. Unfortunately for Mr Williamson, there is no compelling need for Cabinet ministers who boil everything down to a half-witted playground sulk. It’s high time the Education Secretary learned that if he has nothing coherent to say, he should say nothing at all.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"like brexit scottish independence lockdown has turned culture","story":"This should be a moment when we come together in, if not exactly rejoicing, at least relief. We are weeks away from liberation. Britain has not always covered itself in glory over the past 10 months but, when it came to getting the vaccine, we brilliantly elbowed our way to the front of the queue. Phials of the antigen-inducing stuff are already in the country and, on Tuesday, we will become the first nation in the world to begin a mass inoculation programme.Already things are reopening. On Sunday, I will go to church, take my son to his rugby club and have lunch in the village pub – three things that were illegal a week ago. Yes, there are still irksome prohibitions, but we can glimpse normality around the corner. So why are we angrier than we were before?The answer, I think, has to do with the way almost every isive question now turns into a culture war. Two tribes, reading two sets of media, developing two unrelated narratives, subject to two opposed purity spirals, are so far apart that they might as well inhabit different dimensions.The imminence of vaccination ought, logically, to have put an end to our lockdown quarrels. Restrictions might end in January or February or even March. They might be phased out gradually or extinguished in one blow. But they are going. We no longer need to have furious arguments about the value of saving one life.That, though, is not how the political dynamic works these days. People might initially pick their side contingently and with reservations but, once they have done so, centrifugal forces haul them away from the middle ground. It happened over Scottish independence, it happened over Brexit and it has happened, too, over the lockdown.People who, in April, were mildly worried that the closures were disproportionate had, by October, begun to deny that there was any second wave, to decry facemasks as a symbol of servility, to dabble in anti-vax conspiracies. On the other side, those who had agreed, reluctantly and provisionally, to some restrictions, were now insisting that things stay closed until the entire country had been vaccinated.I find – again, just as with Brexit – that I have moved across the political spectrum without altering my views. I accepted that the lockdown would have some impact in slowing transmission, but I argued that the cost to liberty and livelihoods was too high. I wanted our default position to be freedom, and disliked the way in which defenders of the status quo, rather than proponents of radical change, were asked to prove their case. I particularly resented the way the goalposts kept shifting – the way “flatten the curve” became “beat the virus”.At first, my opinions upset lockdowners. Latterly, though, they have started to enrage the people who think that governments are too close to Big Pharma.In exactly the same way, arguing that we should withdraw from the EU’s political structures but keep many of its market arrangements, a position that defined me as an extreme Eurosceptic throughout the Nineties and the Noughties, nowadays makes me a wet in the eyes of some Brexiteers who have come late to the argument.Still, this needs to be spelt out. The immediacy of a vaccine alters the calculus. We are no longer being forced to put up with open-ended restrictions. We are no longer being told to suffer social and economic costs simply for the sake of pushing fatalities a few weeks into the future.The past ten months were a mistake, exacting too high a price for too slight a gain. But those ten months are now a sunk cost. The question is how to lift the remaining restrictions as early as practicable.Which brings us to the mirror radicalisation of the lockdowners. Had it been possible to vaccinate the vulnerable in March, there would have been no question of confining the general population.Now, though, the status quo has shifted, and with it people’s default expectations. I increasingly hear the argument that we shouldn’t end the lockdown until we reach herd immunity – in other words, until we have vaccinated some 70 per cent of the adult population.Starting with that conclusion, lockdown nostalgics then cast around for rationalisations. “Ah, but what about Long Covid – can’t be too careful, eh?”We need to be clear about this. Once people in at-risk categories have been offered the option of vaccination, the remaining restrictions should end entirely and immediately. We can’t stop people congregating because of a disease which does not pose an exceptional danger to the young or middle-aged. We must recover our ability to make reasoned assessments, to take calculated risks.Sadly, that is easier said than done. This week, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said that there wouldn’t come a moment when “we throw off masks and hand sanitiser and say that’s it, it’s behind us, like the end of the war”.Except that the end of the war did not mean the end of wartime controls. Identity cards lasted until 1952, rationing until 1954, conscription until 1960. This time, similarly, there will be pressure to make all sorts of emergency measures permanent. Will any future government be able to restrict free school meals to term time? Or withdraw the subsidies on which theatres now rely? Or defy pressure to give permanent preference to underprivileged exam applicants?If anyone can prevent the rise of a vast and malign nanny state, it is the prime minister, who immediately distanced himself from Prof Van-Tam’s remarks. Boris has the personality and the optimism to convince the country that there is nothing dangerous about the freedoms which, until this year, we regarded as our birthright. We need to hear his optimism now.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus tiers map england restrictions rules","story":"Article bookmarkedFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileDon\u0026#x27t show me this message again✕Most of the country will be under tougher rules than before the lockdown after government scientists warned previous measures were not effective enough to stem rising Covid-19 infections.The Department for Health published details of which tiers areas would be in on Thursday as Matt Hancock outlined the plans in the Commons.Only a handful of areas have been placed in tier 1, where the restrictions are the most limited.

This and the other vaccines are a huge step forward in the fight against coronavirus and could save tens of thousands of lives. So is the vaccine safe  Who’ll get it first  And will it mean ato normal le  Our  of medical experts - made up of Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, Chief Executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Dr June Raine CBE and Head of Immunisations at Public Health England Dr Mary Ramsay - are here to answer all your questions...  Q. Vaccines usually take years to develop, so how can the Covid- vaccination be safeit’s ready in months  Professor Van-Tam: These vaccines have been through phase one, phase two and phase three, just like ordinary vaccines. With the Pfizer vaccine, I think the total clinical trial size is something like , the AstraZeneca results so far reported are based on just over , volunteers – there’s at least another , to follow, and the number size for Moderna is very similar. These are very, very big studies. The numbers involved were essentially the same as you’d expect for a normal peacetime vaccine, and on top of that the safety assessments and the assessments of effectiveness at the end are the same. Dr Raine: The public can be completely confident that Covid- vaccines will only be available once they have met robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. As Covid- is a public health emergency, scientic evaluation and approval is being done in the shortest time possible while complying with established and robust safety, quality and effectiveness standards. Extensive knowledge on vaccine development with existing vaccines is applied. Safety is our watchword. Everyone can be absolutely clear that the standards that need to be met, will be met. I am completely confident that there has been no pressure whatsoever on the agency and our expert staff to pass the vaccine. None at all. Q. How have you decided who gets the vaccine first  Dr Ramsay: We looked at a lot of data showing who was getting infection and who was dying from infection. The primary thing the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationlooked at was death rates by age, by clinical factors, and by any other factors that GPs could measure, such as deprivation, geography or ethnicity. It’s very clear the death rate is much higher as you get older, particularly over . That’s why we’re prioritising people in older age groups, then coming down in age, picking up people who are clinically vulnerable and those who have underlying conditions along the way. Those working in health and social care will be high on the list as well – they are at risk because they’re getting exposed to infection every day and they may be spreading it to others. The same goes for care home workers – they’re a very high priority.  Q. Will the vaccine prevent disease or just reduce symptoms   Professor Van-Tam: If you’re going to prevent transmission you need a vaccine that is taking out the illness and also the asymptomatic infections. There are some signs from AstraZeneca that this might be the case. That does not mean the other vaccines where results have already been announced or that are or are still in development, don’t also reduce transmission it’s just we don’t know at this point in time. We hope they will because they’ll have a bigger effectthey can take out transmission. Q. Are there any side effects  Dr Ramsay: All the side effects are predictable – the kind of thing you get with other vaccines: a sore arm, bit of a temperature or feeling a bit fatigued, so we’re expecting it to have a similar safety profile to other vaccines. Professor Van-Tam: Every single vaccine authorised for use in the UK has been authorised by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . The three components of authorisation are a safety assessment, an effectiveness assessment and a manufacturing quality assessment – all three need to be ticked before anything is authorised. But there is not a single medicine without side effects. Is it possible that rare side effects could come to light that you’d never pick up in a clinical trial of ,-, patients  Yes, it is – but that’s no dferent from any other medicine.  Q. How will the vaccine be rolled out  Dr Ramsay: The actual act of giving the injection isn’t particularly skillful – all nurses are trained and most vaccines are given by nurses, but with the flu jab we use health care assistants. The key thing is they work under the supervision of nurses. I think there’s going to be a lot of dferent models used because, for example, with elderly, frail people they’re clearly not going to drive to the nearest centre – you might have to take vaccine to them in their home. The hospitals will probably be doing their staff, then there will potentially be these vaccination sites which will probably be more important for the slightly younger population who can drive there. Q. Is there anyone who shouldn’t have it   Dr Ramsay: A reason to defer a vaccination is being pregnant – that’s just being precautionary. We don’t expect there to be a problem, but without having the vaccine tested on pregnant women we’ll probably recommend they wait until after they’ve had the baby. Similarly, it hasn’t been tested in children, although a teenager would probably respond similarly to a young adult so they could likely have the vaccine. Q. Will it be available privately  Professor Van-Tam: I don’t know, but I think it would be a bad thing for public healththe rich and privileged were able to pay their way to the front of the queue, leaving someone at very high risk and not wealthy low down the list – and they would be there’s going to be a global shortage of these vaccines. So I’m opposed to that. Q.

Lord David Frost was due to resume talks this morning with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier after they broke down on Friday.Despite Boris Johnson claiming last year his Brexit deal was “oven-ready’, sources now say odds of a trade pact are “no better than -”.No have reportedly discussed the possibility of the Prime Minister confirming no-deal in a televised address to the nation.And the ‘XO’ no-deal planning committee chaired by Michael Gove could move from daily meetings to sitting “almost round the clock”, according to the Sunday Times.Much of a UK-EU trade deal is agreed but there are still “signicant dferences” on three issues - fishing rights, the ‘level playing field’ of following EU standards, and how any deal will be policed in future.Any of those three could collapse the talks and time is running out - with  days until EU trade rules expire in the UK on December . That will slap tarfs and bureaucracy overnight on much of the £bn a year in trade the UK enjoys with the EU, from food to clothes, cars and electronics. The Budget watchdog says it could cut GDP by % in  and delay our Covid recovery by almost a year. Boris Johnson failed to break the deadlock in an hour-long phone call last night - but agreed to a final push until Monday evening. He and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will decide thenthere’s enough progress on three sticking points.  A British official told the Sunday : “There is barely any time left, and there is no doubt that this process may not end in agreement”. A UK source accused the EU of not treating Britain as in “independent country” and making last-minute demands. But an EU official accused Boris Johnson of “still wanting to have his cake and eat it”, four and a half years after the EU referendum. The official told the Sunday Times: “Where thereaposs a will, thereaposs a way. The question is whether there is a will”.UK Brexiteers are now steeling themselves for a no-deal situation despite Boris Johnson claiming in : “There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.” The hardline European Research Group of MPs said last night: “We have nothing to fear from freedom. And  Tory Cabinet ministers told the Sunday Times they would support a no-deal outcomeBoris Johnson says it is necessary. Boris Johnson is also pressing ahead with plans to introduce a law to the Commons tomorrow allowing him to break international law. The UK Internal Market Bill would give the UK power to decide what rules apply to goods moving from Britain to Northenr Ireland. Only a year ago the Withdrawal Agreement, signed by Boris Johnson with the EU, promised that’d happen via a joint committee. While the row isn’t strictly about trade deal talks, it could create more anger and be a roadblock to any last-minute diplomacy. Evena deal is agreed this week there are questions over how it’ll be ratied by EU leaders and the European Parliament in time. There was already talk weeks ago of a special European Parliament sitting between Christmas and New Year. EU and UK leaders had originally hoped to seal a deal first by mid-October, then by mid-November. EU leaders are due to meet on Thursday for a two-day summit in Brussels - their last scheduled gathering of the year - when they could sign-off on any agreement. The deadlock led to crisis talks last night between Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. In an hour-long phone call, the two leaders agreed to instruct their negotiating teams to resume talks on Sunday in a last attempt to seethey can resolve the remaining dferences. With time rapidly running out before the Brexit transition period ends at the end of the month, British sources warned that the process may still conclude without an agreement. This is the final throw of the dice, said one source close to the negotiations. There is a fair deal to be done that works for both sides, but this will only happenthe EU is willing to respect the fundamental principles of sovereignty and control. In a joint statement following their call, Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen acknowledged signicant dferences remained on the key issues of fishing rights, competition rules and the governance arrangements for any deal.

The Health Secretary added he cannot wait for us to get back to normal and said the Government will at some point be able to set a date for a liberation day. He said the availability of a vaccine - the first doses of which will be given out on V-Day on Tuesday - means the current restrictions could be eased in months to come. But the upbeat Health Secretaryaposs pledges come as a new poll showed more than half of Brits does not trust the Government to handle the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Hancock told the Sunday: I’m a freedom-loving Conservative, and I can’t wait for us to get back to living by mutual respect and personal responsibility - not laws set in Parliament. At some point, we’ll be able to set the date when we can get rid of these restrictions – and you couldn’t have said that only two weeks ago. He said he “can’t wait to scrap this tiered system altogether - adding the measures could be eased by spring. Askedthe start of administering the vaccine this week could bring about a sooner end to the restrictions in the first three months of , he said: Yes it will. Mr Hancock, who is reportedly referring to Tuesday as V-Day, told the newspaper: Thereaposs no doubt that having the vaccine early... will bring forward the moment when we can get rid of these blasted restrictions but until then we have got to follow them. But he also pointed out there are signicant challenges to overcome to make sure care home residents can be vaccinated. The issues mean it could be dficult to get the jab to residents because the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at minus C.  Public Health England said it has secured  specialised Twin Guard ultra-low temperature freezers which provide sufficient storage for approximately five million doses of potential Covid- vaccines which require ultra-low temperature storage. The fridges, which are not portable, each hold around , doses. Mr Hancock said the positive news of a vaccine will bring forward the moment coronavirus restrictions can be eased, but urged people to continue following the current measures in the meantime. The first vaccinations will begin on Tuesday, paving the way for the largest scale immunisation programme in the countryaposs history. Vaccinations will be administered at dozens of hospital hubs with people aged  and over, care home workers and NHS workers - who are at higher risk of contracting Covid- - receiving the jab first.  Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: Despite the huge complexities, hospitals will kickstart the first phase of the largest scale vaccination campaign in our countryaposs history from Tuesday. The first tranche of vaccine deliveries will be landing at hospitals by Monday in readiness. The NHS has a strong record of delivering large scale vaccination programmes - from the flu jab, HPV vaccine and lesaving MMR jabs - hardworking staff will once again rise to the challenge to protect the most vulnerable people from this awful disease.  Meanwhile, a survey has suggested that the majority of the British public does not trust the Government to manage the coronavirus pandemic. Research found that % of people said they do not trust the UK Government to control the spread of Covid- - the first time since April that distrust has become the majority view in the country, according to a series of studies.

Now they are being treated unfairly when it comes to getting the Covid vaccine. The Government – through experts on the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation – says they should be first in the queue because they are the most vulnerable. Of course they should. But it turns out those most vulnerable of all are likely to be at the back of the queue. Technical problems with the Pfizer jab mean it won’t be able to be taken into residential homes. That means only those who are mobile will have the dubious privilege of being loaded onto buses to be transported to hospitals and vaccination hubs. It may be a day out for them.

There’ll be no cards, no presents, no crackers or trimmings – not even a glass of fizz. In fact, on Christmas Day, itself, I’ll be waking up next to a stranger. As crazy as it may sound, I can’t wait.I had no idea what meditation was until I went to Thailand in . I’d separated from my husband after four years of marriage and went away to do some soul-searching.One day I went on a trip with a group of people to a beautul temple and we were askedwe would like to do meditation. I was the only volunteer.  The monk got me to sit in the lotus position, which was terribly painful, then asked me to close my eyes and to see a flame in front of me and focus on my breath.All I could think about was how sore my knees were and what I’d be having for dinner. I couldn’t wait for it to end. It went on for two hours, but when I walked out afterwards, I felt amazing. My senses were heightened, I felt so aware and alert and relaxed. It was incredible. I was training in psychology and interested in how the mind worked so, back in London, I found a meditation class and started going once a week. I bought meditation CDs and books and even a cushion so I could practise at home. I got so into it, my mother became concerned. She thought I was conversing with spirits, trying to become a medium or something.My parents are strong churchgoers and had no idea about meditation. They thought it could be dangerous and affect my mind. But the more I practised, the more I could feel myself benefiting. It helped me understand myself and my relationships better, it helped me come to terms with my orce.I can be quite self-critical and it helped me to be less harsh on myself and learn to manage those critical thoughts better. I felt calmer. I wanted to immerse myself in it more fully so, that year, I went on a Christmas retreat.I’d spent the previous Christmas partying with friends, so spending it in silence couldn’t be more dferent. I didn’t tell my parents or my friends or work colleagues. I thought they’d think I’d become some kind of crazy hippy and it was all a bit weird. I was almost ashamed of it. The retreat was at a Quaker school in Oxfordshire and fairly basic. I was told to bring comfy clothes and slippers. The dormitories were in outbuildings and quite cold. I was relieved to get a room to myself.  But the biggest challenge was the silence. It was a beginner’s retreat for  days so they introduced it gradually – a couple of hours a day, then half a day, then a full day. I still found it dficult. The fact it was Christmas made it harder.I was glad I’d taken a book and spent most of the time reading, then I found out you’re not supposed to read, you’re supposed to avoid all communication, including reading, eye contact and smiling. It’s all about “stilling the mind”. I was tempted to send a text, but I tried to respect the silence because you don’t have that in ordinary le – it’s rare. Everyone was allocated a task – chopping vegetables or washing up, sometimes cleaning the toilet. In between meditation , we got on with our tasks. Of course there is no speaking, so the tasks were listed for us to see on a notice board.Christmas Day was just like any other day. There were no decorations, carols or trimmings. We had a nut roast for dinner and sat in silence.I found it strange at first. It felt rude to be sitting down with no one talking – eating is such a social thing.But after a couple of days, my mind began to slow down and settle and I actually found it quite nice. It took the pressure off making conversation and I could enjoy the food more.It was the same routine every day – we got woken by the bell at am, we did meditation before breakfast, then got on with our tasks. Then, after sitting or walking meditation in the grounds, it was time for lunch. The food was vegetarian or vegan – simple, but good. Always freshly prepared and it smelled lovely. There was no alcohol. I enjoy a glass of wine, but I didn’t miss it.Katy Perry, Jenner Aniston, Madonna and Angelina Jolie have all spoken about the benefits of meditation. Silent retreats were among the top wellness trends for  and often attract people aged  to . Retreats offer the chance to rest, reflect and reconnect with nature, do yoga, swim, walk or simply nap.

Michael Gilchrist, , who has bi-polar disorder and learning dficulties, has also won an appeal for a probe into whether racism played a part in the incident. The single dad-of-two was left with post-traumatic stress disorder after he was doused in CS spray and shocked with a Taser for a total of  seconds. Michael’s mum Novlyn, , who now looks after him, said: “I can never forgive the police for what they’ve done. “They saw there was something wrong with Michael, but showed no care. They treated him worse than an animal.” Michael, who lived alone in Wythenshawe, Manchester, became ­distressed as he made his way to see his brother Andrew and cut his hands while breaking windows on June , . Two officers called to the scene said he appeared aggressive and they feared he may have attacked someone because of his bloodied hands, the High Court was told. One constable squirted CS spray twice while his colleague used his Taser twice, with one shock fired while Michael was on the ground despite there being enough officers to physically restrain him. PC Samuel Schofield then arrived and discharged his Taser twice, delivering eight shocks lasting  seconds over a period of  seconds before Michael was taken to hospital. Official advice is not to use a Taser after CS spray has been deployed because it may be flammable. Tasers should also not be usedthey have already proved ineffective. Michael was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital and later diagnosed with PTSD. Retired social worker Novlyn said: “He wasn’t able to communicate at all. It was horrendous.” "},{"url":null,"title":"barman tier 2 begs punters","story":"NewsBarman in Tier  begs punters to only get a pinthungry as unwanted food binnedThe barman claims huge amounts of food is going to waste as customers order unwanted substantial meals to be allowed to buy booze in keeping with Tier  rulesmirrorShareCommentsByTalia ShadwellReporter:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsPeople dine outside a bar in Soho under Londons Tier  restrictions \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Scientists wrote: Based on the iability in the data and dferential responses in the population we conservatively estimate that a protective immune response after SARS-CoV- infection or vaccination may last for  days. Their estimate is based on the fact that other coronaviruses tend to reinfect after one to two years. Reinfections with seasonal coronaviruses occur frequently at  months and sometimes as early as six months - but not within three months - scientists said. They explained: Based on this information, we conclude that: Within one month of natural infection, a high proportion of people will develop immunity which is protective against disease caused by reinfection . This protection is likely to persist for at least three months . The level of protection against subclinical re-infectionis uncertain.  They said that  days after an effective vaccine, a high proportion of people develop immunity which is protective against disease caused by reinfection . Experts added that a small proportion of people may not develop immunity following either natural infection or vaccination - but the number is said to be small compared to the majority who get immunity. According to NERVTAG, natural immunity is sustained in most cases.The document added that coronavirus antibodies can be detected in at least % of people who have been infected with the virus - and this figure approaches % with new tests. The antibodies can be measured within about a week of symptoms developing, the paper added. The document, which was published on Friday, was considered by SAGE on November . Scientists said the trials of coronavirus vaccines suggest that a high degree of immunity to COVID- disease can be obtained, at least in the short-term. Despite some uncertainties around the level and duration of immunity, experts concluded: Some form of Covid- immunity certication is likely to be possible but further data and considerations are needed before a recommendation can be made. Vaccinations in the UK will begin next Tuesday after the country became the first in the world to approve the Pfizer jab for use.

The works were labelled a tragedy after the mile-long stretch of a protected riveraposs banks was flattened. The Herefordshire Wildle Trustsaid it hopes for a prosecution over the damage to the River Lugg, which it called a crime against the environment. The trust said all bankside and riverside habitats have been completely obliterated after the river and its banks were bulldozed, straightened and reprofiled into a sterile canal. A potato and cattle farmer has come forward claiming he cleared the land to prevent flooding at nearby properties.However experts have claimed the works will make flooding worse downstream and put wildle at risk. Farmer John Price, , claimed local homeowners had become frustrated waiting for authorities to tackle the blocked river after their homes were damaged in last yearaposs floods. So he had taken matters into his own hands, he told The . Mr Price, whose farm neighbours the river on a farm in Kingsland, near Leominster, admitted to the newspaper he had bulldozed and cut trees down - but claimed he acted with permission from local authorities.  He said he had watched the river all his le, claiming no one knows this river better than myself. I have always looked after the river. He also claimed he had the support of the village and parish council, and had been asked to stop the erosion because he was the land owner adjoining that stretch of the river. Mr Price told The : It was up to the Environmental Agency to look after these rivers but they donapost do any work and havenapost got any money to do the work because they spend it all on clipboards. He added: I have not pushed any trees out and I havenapost knocked any trees down I have only cleared what ones came down in the flood.  The Environment Agencysaid it had launched an urgent investigation. West Mercia Police confirmed the force is assisting the probe. The HWT said wildle affected by the damage includes crayfish, otters and salmon, lampreys and dragonflies and a host of rare river wildle at the Site of Special Scientic Interest. The trust said the River Lugg would be a test case for the Governmentaposs commitment to strengthen wildle protection, and it hopes for a prosecution. HWT chief executive Helen Stace said: A large stretch of one of the UKaposs most important rivers, the Lugg, has been devastated, with dire consequences for wildle and water quality downstream - this is a tragedy.  The bankside trees are all grubbed out and burnt, the river gravels have been scraped away, and the beautul meanders of the river have been straightened and reprofiled. As former leader of the English Nature rivers team which notied the Lugg as a Site of Special Scientic Interest, I know this river to be one of the most enchanting tree-lined reaches, with immense value for wildle. This is a crime against the environment. Swt action needs to be taken and we want to see the authorities investigate the matter swtly. We expect this case to be dealt with in a serious and robust manner and any resulting prosecution should act as a deterrent to prevent anyone committing this type of crime ever again.  We will also be calling for restoration of the river to its natural channel. HWT said it believes bulldozing part of the river is a contravention of the Wildle and Countryside Act and the Environmental Permitting Regulations  and should have required consent from the Environment Agency, as well as planning consent. Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildle Trusts, said: The Government has promised to transform our environmental governance as we leave the EU and for the UK to be a world leader in environmental protection. Devastating incidents such as this one will be a vital apostest caseapos as we come to the end of the transition period for the Governmentaposs ambition to develop a aposworld-leadingapos environment enforcement structure.  Unfortunately, the Government has so far failed to live up to this standard, with poor resourcing leaving Natural England unable to properly monitor and protect our most important wild places - Sites of Special Scientic Interest. Andrew Nixon, conservation senior manager of HWT, said: The actions taken on this stretch of the river will have far-reaching consequences, both for this stretch of river and floodplain and further downstream. Removing all bankside vegetation and scraping out the riverbed and banks will cause a huge increase in the speed the water moves through the river and increases the flood risk downstream.

Mark Fellows showered a hail of bullets on gangland rivals but never explained how or why. Now the Sunday Mirror can reveal he has finally admitted his guilt over the Salford drug wars that earned Manchester the title “Gunchester”. In letters from jail, sickening Fellows tells how he:Hid in a graveyard wearing a fake beard and a mask until “Mr Big” Paul Massey came home. Fired bullets at Massey’s feet so he “danced like a cowboy” before firing the fatal shots. Joked about killing a PC who nearly interrupted a stakeout. Shot Massey’s mob fixer John Kinsella as he walked through woodland – finishing him off as “he lay crying on the floor”. Wants to die from cancer rather than serve decades in London’s tough Belmarsh jail. Is prepared to kill again in prison – knowing that his sentence cannot be increased. The hits were the bloody culmination of a tit-for-tat drug war between Massey’s “A Team” and the “Anti-A Team”. Fellows, , tells all in letters due to be published in the true crime book Salford Lads. He reveals how, night after night, he lay hidden in a churchyard with an Uzi submachine gun waiting for the perfect moment to kill Massey, . And he even laughs as he tells how he considered killing a cop. Fellows writes: “The night before I was waiting for Massey and a police officer turned up when I was laying there. “I thought that I was going to have to do him but he never saw me. Ha ha ha!”  It was .pm on July , , when Fellows pulled the Uzi from a bag and fired round after round at Massey. Fellows says that despite the  beard, mask and being clad in combat fatigues, Massey still spotted him as he stepped from his Series  BMW. A murder trial at Liverpool Crown Court was told  rounds were fired – four hitting Massey’s chest. Fellows pleaded not guilty to two murders but was convicted. Now he explains in grisly detail just what happened. Of Massey, a grandfather, he writes: “I parked my van in the estate, my bike was in the back. I had my mountain bike gear on. I rode to near Paul Massey’s house and put my bike in the bushes. I got to the church, changed into the army gear and put a  beard on. I was laying in the churchyard, Massey’s house in front of me.  “[Massey] saw me, so I shot at him from across the road, but missed. When I crossed over, he was behind the bins, hiding. I was playing games with him, shooting at his feet like they do in cowboy films. “That’s why he got shot in his foot and that’s why so many bullets were fired. He tried to make it to his front door, so I put one in his chest. He hit the floor, out cold. I didn’t want to get close, so stood back and shot four times at his head. “I missed and my clip had run out, so I made my way home. If I’d have got close... I’d have hit his head and he wouldn’t have been able to make any phone calls, but at least he is dead.” The murder trial heard a  call made by Massey. He said: “Ambulance. I’ve been shot... hurry up”. The operator asked the postcode – then the line went silent. Massey made his name selling drugs in Man-chester’s s rave scene and was a known “face” in Salford.  Meanwhile, Kinsella, , was respected and feared in equal measure and famously intervened when a gangster threatened “to maim” former Liverpool and England footballer Steven Gerrard, . Fellows was said to be a trusted foot soldier in the so-called Anti-A team. The gang feud – which as recently as last year spilled over to the Costa del Sol – is thought to have begun when a woman threw a drink over a member of the A Team in summer . Violence quickly escalated. A shotgun was fired into a car, injuring one man, before another victim suffered horric injuries in a machete attack. In March  a grenade was thrown at an A Team family member’s house. Months later Christian Hickey, seven, and his mother Jayne were shot and injured at their home. The picture of Christian in a hospital bed shocked the nation. He was left in a wheelchair and needed a string of operations to be able to walk again.  His dad, Christian Hickey Snr, had been the intended target. Fellows – nicknamed Iceman for being cold and calculated – was already in the frame for Massey’s murder when he shot Kinsella in May . The victim was walking in woods in Rainhill, Merseyside, with his partner. In one of his letters, Fellows says: “Kinsella was lying on floor so I put another one in him to shut him up... then I put two in his head.” Kinsella – who had a six-week-old baby – was considered a small-time player but the killings were strikingly alike. Detectives found a Garmin watch Fellows used for long-distance running. It recorded him on a reconnaissance run shortly before Massey’s killing. The data correlated with the hundreds of hours of CCTV and phone records analysed by police. Fellows was found guilty in February  of murdering Massey and Kinsella. He is one of only  UK people to get whole le terms. Co-defendant Steven Boyle, , was found guilty of the murder of Kinsella, but cleared over Massey’s killing. He was jailed for le and will serve a minimum of  years. Last month Fellows was handed another le sentence for his part in a machete attack on Aaron Williams, an associate of the A Team gang.

The acrobatic assaults, known as rollovers, had been carried out  times to September, with their popularity likely ramping up in the run up to Christmas. High-value goods like PlayStation s, TVs and Apple products as well as consignments of booze, cosmetics and cigarettes have been pillaged in transit.Three cars are often used to box HGVs in, with one thief, often secured by a rope, climbing out of sunroofs or modied hatches and using cutters and crowbars to break through back doors and hurl out loot, The Times reports.  The boom in online shopping has seen delivery firms increasingly targeted, with van drivers who often have minimal security training also hit. In one aposrolloverapos raid on September  a lorry heading to Norfolk was attacked overnight, with high-value parcels stolen. No one has been arrested. Police have warned hauliers about the tactic and advised them to boost their security and y routes - although the planning involved in many attacks leads to suspicions of insiders feeding back information.

Lexi Pitchford, , is now looking forward to opening her gts and getting stuck into a traditional ­festive roast – both things she has previously struggled to do. The youngster was born ­without a right hand and, although she learned to adapt, found ­everyday tasks such as holding a pen and brushing her teeth dficult. But le will be very dferent for Lexi now, thanks to her new custom-made Hero Arm from Open Bionics – which arrived just in time for Christmas. Mum Emma Mountford said: “It’s completely changed Lexi’s le. Lexi’s always been the last to open her presents as she struggled to get into them. Now she has her bionic arm, she can’t wait to rip off the wrapping paper. “The arm has given her a massive confidence boost and a chance for independence.”Initially, Lexi’s family thought the £, prosthetic would be way out of their reach – but they started crowdfunding online and smashed their target in less than  hours. Lexi was lucky enough to receive a grant through the Open Bionics Foundation and an anonymous ­donor also came forward. Emma, , said: “The support was incredible – Lexi’s school held ­fundraisers and local businesses chipped in. “The money was raised in no time, thanks to the kind donor.”  Emma and her partner Lee also set up a GoFundMe page to raise a further £, to cover the arm’s warranty and now the mum of four can’t imagine Lexi without her ­bionic limb. “She absolutely loves it,” she said. “There were lots of smiles when she opened it. “She is practising gripping pens and being able to hold cups. She’s going from strength to strength.“Hopefully she’ll be able to grip cutlery in time for Christmas dinner.”Emma found out at her -week scan that Lexi was missing her right hand.

Danny Hargreaves, from Cardf, is wowing Christmas lights crowds with his gardenaposs festive makeover in Llandaff. His effort comes complete with a crashed helicopter and fake snow and even aposBruce Willisapos has made an appearance. Dannyaposs festive grotto will be familiar to many in the Welsh captial who flock to his address twice a year to see his Halloween and Christmas decorations.The -year-old  has been creating the dazzling decorations for the past five to six years, reports Wales Online. He spent days transforming his home into a spooky Halloween house covered in skeletons and tarantulas in October. This year Danny and his family have spent the last few weeks turning the house into a winter spectacular to try and spread some festive cheer and raise some money for charity by doing so. Being a busy time of year, Danny said they were often adding items late at night so you can imagine the neighboursapos shock when a huge helicopter appeared in the garden one morning.  The film lover owns a special effects company called Real SFX who are responsible for creating the special effects in shows such as Doctor Who and Peaky Blinders. Danny said his love of film and TV - as well as a few favours from friends in the industry - have helped to make the house so spectacular this year. When asked how he came up with the idea, Danny said: Iaposve always loved Christmas and Halloween and with everything going on this year we decided to embrace it more than ever. When we did the Halloween house and raised over £, I knew we were going to have to do something for Christmas. I work in film and TV so it was natural for me to choose a film theme so I thought why not take some of my favourite Christmas films and do a bit of a homage to them.  And itaposs fair to say the house definitely does that. Some of the nationaposs favourite Christmas films are featured including The Grinch, Die Hard, Gremlins, Home Alone and National Lampoon. The Grinch is behind the wheel of the crashed helicopter in yet another attempt to steal Christmas, while the mischievous Gremlins are scurrying around the house. Danny said he usually tries to go away for the festive period but as that hasnapost been able to happen this year he decided to do more decorating than usual.  I think we all need a bit of a smile on our face at the moment, he said. I think this Christmas everyone is a bit unsure of whataposs going on so I just wanted to bring some joy to people in a dficult time. The reaction has been really positive so far. I have to say I think a few children were late for school this week for looking at it but I have to say everyone has loved it. Itaposs actually taken me longer than the Halloween house. Iaposve been busier recently so it has taken a few weeks. Iaposve been out decorating at like pm so hope the neighbours havenapost minded too much. I havenapost even fully finished yet.  And while the house itself looks incredible, the stories behind the items are just as brilliant with some coming straight from the sets of Hollywood films. Iaposve pulled in some of my film and TV contacts and have ended up with some amazing items, said Danny. The helicopter is from The War of the Worlds as well as quite a few other things and the car has come straight from the latest Batman film. I initially thought about having Santa crash the helicopter but thought that would look a bit odd so in the end I thought aposwho would be mischievous enough to crash a plane apos and it just had to be the Grinch. While Danny and his partner have been decorating the house in some form each year, this year they decided to raise money for charity by doing so. They are asking people to spend the money they would usually spend around this time of year by making a donation to charity - specically a childrenaposs charity called Dreams and Wishes - that relies on donations.  The charity works to support terminally ill children. What we are trying to do is encourage a donation to this charity that will make kids smile as well. Many charities this year are really struggling too so by doing this we can really help them - and it saves me having to run a marathon to raise money. It would be goodit could inspire some others to also think about creative ways of raising money for charity.

Another female received minor injuries in the incident. Local resident and mum-of-two Candice Nevison, , said she thought her own house had collapsed for how loud the bang on Green Lane was. She described how one person jumped out their window engulfed in flames following the explosion at around : on Saturday. Another person ran out of the burning building, said Ms Nevison, whose own mother was among those safely evacuated. It sounded like there was a massive bang and it felt like something had fallen on my head, she said. The impact was just so extreme I thought my own house was collapsing. I was terried because it was so loud and my mum lived right on that street.I looked out and there was a massive fire. Thankfully my mum was evacuated as one of the six homes and sheaposs okay. She added: I saw people running out the house at around .am. I saw one person jump out the window while another person carried an old lady over her shoulder. You just donapost expect anything like this to happen. Iaposve never seen or heard anything like it before. Another neighbour described the massive blast as surreal. He was told that three people in the property were taken to hospital with burns.  Colin Stone, , said: I just got out because I thought my house had exploded. The whole street thought so - it was surreal. We were told by fire marshalls that they got taken to hospital with burns, I hope theyaposre okay. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service manager Benjy Bush said they were not ruling out the possibility that a gas leak may have caused the explosion. But he said it was too early to determine and efforts were focused on securing the area after extensive and signicant damage caused by the blast and subsequent fire.  More than  firefighters along with four fire engines, support and specialist teams attended the scene. Mr Bush said that an elderly lady as well as two others who were in the house were being looked after by a neighbour after they escaped from the collapsing building when they arrived. The extent of their injuries is still unknown, but they are currently recovering in hospital. Mr Bush added: We donapost know yet what caused the fire.

They put between £ and £ aside for each child – so have to prepare for around £, to come out of their banks. The parents - who rely on Noelaposs bakery business to make a living - also splurge on  to  rolls of wrapping paper each winter. Each child is given their own sack of gts so the goodies don’t get mixed up. Bigger presents are placed on the floor and neatly labelled to avoid any confusion on the big day.Their kids who live at home – Chloe,  Jack,  Daniel,  Luke,  Katie,  James,  Ellie,  Aimee,  Josh,  Max,  Tillie,  Oscar, nine Casper, eight Hallie, five Phoebe, four Archie, three, Bonnie, two baby Heidie and granddaughter Ophelia – have trees in their bedrooms too.The Radfords shared tips on how to make Christmas work with such a big family back in October.The first thing they have to do is budget.

Pfizer and BioNTechaposs jab has arrived in the UK and will begin being rolled out to the public within days.The clinically vulnerable and frontline health care workers are at the head of the queue for the long-awaiting coronavirus vaccine.Sources told the newspaper the Queen, , and the Duke of Edinburgh, , will be eligible within weeks and have already accepted the offer of the jab. Both are reportedly expected to accept the offer based on the advice of their doctors. They will be in line for the jab once people in their s and care home residents are offered it. The elderly are among the top tiers of the priority queue for the Covid- vaccine. The most severely clinically vulnerable people with listed medical conditions will be given the first shots. Public health experts are said to be considering whether publicising the senior royalsapos vaccinations will help their campaign to combat anti-vaxxer sentiment.  Prince Charles and Prince William are also reportedly being considered for roles in publicising the vaccination programme.  However the Mail reports such a move could be seen as Buckingham Palace allowing the royals to be politicised. Courtiers are also said to be concerned there could be concerns about breaching the royalsapos medical privacy.  The younger royals, including Prince William and Kate Middleton, wonapost be in line for the jab until later in  when it is expected people in their thirties will begin being vaccinated. The Mail reports that the possibility of the royals playing a role in vaccine promotion to allay scepticism is being discussed at Buckingham Palace and in Whitehall. Officials are also said to be considering whether widely respected celebrities such as Sir David Attenborough could be asked to front-foot the campaign by getting the jab. However officials are said to be concerned about provoking allegations of favouritism. A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace said that medical decisions were personal, and they would not be commenting on the story.

The first Covid- vaccine has been approved for use in the UK. It is now here and ready to be rolled out. I’m hugely grateful to all the ­scientists around the world who have made this happen. They have worked non-stop – just like our frontline healthcare professionals – to put a halt to this virus and let us get on with le as normal. All of those who volunteered for the vaccine trials deserve a huge thank you for helping to make this ­happen so swtly. Without all of you, we would not be where we are today. Developing a vaccine for coronavirus is a huge achievement. And it’s important people are ­reassured that these treatments have been rigorously tested before being licensed for use. As a society, we take so many medications daily without question. How many of us get the annual flu jab  I certainly do, working in our NHS. We all simply trust they will make us feel better and stop us getting ill. That is because our independent regulators work hard to trial vaccines and drugs to ensure they’re safe. That’s no dferent for this vaccine. Thousands of the smartest minds across the world have been working to develop a vaccine. That is why we have so many prospects on the horizon. It’s important to recognise that these experts know more about the science of vaccines than random people on social media do. In recent years, the spread of misinformation has increased dramatically. It’s vital the Government launches a large-scale public information campaign to answer questions on the vaccine and encourage uptake.  Dangerous myths circulate on social media and it’s not good enough to just ignore them and hope they go away. Labour has offered to work with ministers to tackle online harms, and that’s why we’re calling on the Government to bring forward their long-overdue Online Harms legislation because we need a regulator with real teeth to cope with social media companies. If the vaccine is good enough for all the scientists and the regulator, then it’s good enough for me and my family. Too many lives have been lost from this virus. The UK passed the tragic milestone of , deaths from Covid- this week. Each of these , people has a family struggling with the reality of grief during Covid-. These are all lives lost too soon.

But there are also some more practical benefits, including being able to use the Royal Train rather than climbing aboard a delayed, standing-room only Northern Rail service. However, itaposs believed that despite being a member of the royal family for nine years, Kate is still waiting to travel on the plush train that dates back to Queen Victoria.Kateaposs sister-in-law, Meghan Markle, got to ride the train just a few weeks after her royal wedding to Prince Harry. The Queen invited the new Duchess of Sussex to join her for a day of engagements in Chester, and they travelled there together on the train. In their book Finding Freedom, royal reporters Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand describe Meghanaposs trip on the train. They write: It was a daunting journey for the new we, despite the amenities of Her Majestyaposs personal train, which had private bedroomsa sitting room with a sofa of hand-stitched velvet cushions, a dining table for six, a desk where the Queen worked on her papers and secondary air suspension for a smoother than average ride.The train conductor drives extra slowly around .am to make sure the water stays in the tub while the Queen has her bath. The Royal Train has been used by Monarchs since Queen Victoria, and while it used to be just as plush as you would expect, with bright velvet sofas and cushions, itaposs now far more low key with simple decor and furniture. The train has bedrooms, bathrooms, a sitting room and a large dining room, and there is also an office where the Queen works during her travels.The train also has space for her staff, and there are bedrooms with bunk beds. Speaking to the BBC back in , director of royal travel Tim Hewlett said: There is a perception the train is a bit like the Orient Express. But there are not many bathroom furnishings you could not get in Homebase or BQ. Queen Victoria was the first monarch to travel by train, and her favourite carriage on the old steam train has recently been restored to itaposs former glory.

The thrty mumaposs method saves money in the long run despite costing a bit more up front. Mary Konn, from New South Wales in Australia, bulk cooks meals including beef stroganoff with pasta, chicken peanut stir fry, and spaghetti bolognese. She sets aside  hours every Sunday and Monday to bulk prepare all the meals, saving her time cooking during the week. The -year-old told how her family had long prepped meals for the following week, but tried to take it to an aposextreme levelapos to save money and see how long the food would last for them. We estimated that the meals should last us three to four weeks depending on whether my husband and I take one for lunch, Mary said, adding that they store the meals in a L chest freezer they bought. Usually we only cook for a week or two at a time but my husband and I both enjoy cooking so we just thought weaposll try it on a larger scale so it lasts longer - anditaposs good, weaposll keep it going, she said. MARY KUNNaposS TOP MEAL PREP TIPS * Always bring a list! When shopping, always bring a list of ingredients you need, and meals you are going to make before heading out. This makes shopping itself infinitely easier. * When bulk cooking so many meals, youaposre going to need to store them all somewhere, so consider this early on and think about where all the meals are going to be stored, whether this means freezer space or more containers. * One key part of meal prepping is not wasting, when shopping, cooking and eating, so make sure everyone likes the recipes youaposre making so nothing goes to waste. This will mean vegetarianoptions as well. * When bulk cooking, bulk buy too. Bulk buying from butchers and fresh fruit and veg shops keeps cost down. WHATaposS ON MARYaposS MEAL PREPPED MENU  * Chicken rissoles with rice * Beef stroganoff with penne pasta  * Beef goulash with nockerl * Beef kofta with roasted vegetables * Chicken peanut satay stir fry with rice * Chicken and lentil curry * Spaghetti Bolognese * Potato pie * Lentils Mary added: My husband used to buy so much takeaway as we were just not prepared with food, but now he will just grab a pre-prepared meal from the freezer and off he goes,apos she said.

University of Chester student Ben Thornton was diagnosed with testicular cancer aged just . Doctors told him it had spread to his liver, lungs and brain in just  hours. He received the devastating diagnosis just days after attending his grandfatheraposs funeral. Ben has recalled the day two years ago he saw his GP about feeling lethargic.The doctor immediately recognised something was seriously wrong and sent him to AE, reports Cheshire Live.After running some tests, doctors told Ben that they suspected he had cancer in his lungs. He was then taken to intensive care, where it was discovered that the cancer had started in his testicles and had spread. Ben said: “I’d just started my second year of university and went back home to Bristol for my granddad’s funeral. I was feeling lethargic, but I just put it down to the fact that I was going through an emotional time. As the week went on I started feeling a bit fluey and sick, I remember sitting in the church during the funeral and feeling queasy. “When I got back home to Chester I saw a GP, who told me I looked really dehydrated and should go to AE. I could barely walk at this point so got a mate to drive me there – but even walking from the car to the hospital entrance was a struggle and I had to lean on the wall to recover.” He started emergency chemotherapy right away and had to stay in the ICU for about three weeks. Once he was well enough, he was transferred to Clatterbridge Hospital, where he was supported by Teenage Cancer Trust’s specialist nurses.Ben was in treatment over Christmas , and worried that he would not make it home for Christmas Day.He explains: “It was touch and go as to whether Iaposd be allowed home for Christmas – but on Christmas Eve I managed to convince them to let me go.I managed to have a big Christmas dinner and fitted in a snooze afterwards to wake myself back up. We still had fun as a family, and I played new Xbox games with my siblings like we usually would.”Shortly after Christmas, Ben was transferred to a Teenage Cancer Trust unit in Bristol to be closer to his family. He finished chemotherapy in April , and then went through two surgeries: one to remove two lymph nodes on his liver, and one to remove his right testicle.Ben is now in remission, but the coronavirus crisis has made  another challenging year.He explains: “There are some benign tumours left in my lungs and I’m asthmatic, so I could be more at risk. We’d planned to go to Australia this year but thataposs now had to be cancelled – I was seeing it as a big trip to celebrate getting back to normal. This year’s really been put on hold.” Now aged , Ben is backing a new campaign from charity Teenage Cancer Trust - and has a message of hope and sound advice for people young and old this Christmas who are facing cancer treatment during the coronavirus pandemic. He adds: “My advice to people going through treatment at this time of year is to really throw yourself into Christmas! Christmas is a great opportunity to forget about treatment, so try not to spend it worrying about what’s ahead. And most importantly, eat as much as you can!” Coronavirus has had a severe impact on Teenage Cancer Trust’s income, slashing it by a third – a shortfall of around £million a year. Yet due to the pandemic, support from its specialist nurses and youth workers is needed more than ever, which is why Ben is sharing his story in support of the charity’s Christmas fundraising appeal. Kate Collins, Chief Executive at Teenage Cancer Trust, said: “Sadly, young people with cancer have been hit harder than most by the coronavirus pandemic.

Many contracts were for vital supplies, such as medicines and ventilators, but included £million for PPE that was unusable, £, to research “public attitudes” and several deals to firms with links to No. A National Audit Office report revealed last month that half of all the contracts were awarded without going to competitive tender – and at least  companies who won one had links to the Tories. The total cost of the contracts was revealed in response to a Commons question by Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, Jonathan Ashworth. He said: “The Tories have used this pandemic to line the pockets of fat cat corporations and cronies. We’ve seen lucrative contracts handed out to mates of ministers. It’s time to end this ­rotten Tory cronyism.” It came as the Government faced calls to stop big pharmaceutical firms making a killing from the pandemic.

The two women, both part of huge crime families in the north of England, were caught on camera doing a cash for drugs deal. Natalie Wrafter, , and Shazia Din, , were filmed in the car park of Doncaster prison after visiting Wrafteraposs kingpin father, Peter. Peter had led the Doncaster side of a huge cross-Pennines drug trafficking operation from December  to the following July, reports the Manchester Evening News. The Wrafters were involved in the supply of class-A drugs, including heroin and cocaine, with Natalie taking over the family business when Peter went to prison. Police found Peter in possession of a revolver and ammunition, alongside a kilo of heroin which was kept in a van outside his Doncaster home - he was sentenced to -years for his part in the operation which had seen him join forces with another crime family from Bury, Greater Manchester. This Greater Manchester crime family was led by Din who, alongside her sister, Abia, , distributed heroin, cocaine and amphetamines throughout South Yorkshire-based networks. In the clip that was secretly filmed in the car park of HMP Doncaster, Wrafter can be seen passing bundles of cash to Din, who stuffs them into a bag in the boot of her Mercedes. After the money was handed over, James Dickson travelled from Doncaster to Manchester to conclude the trade deal struck by Natalie Wrafter and Din, the Manchester Evening News reports.  A beauty business, known as aposThe Beauty Boothapos was set up by the Din family as a front to launder dirty money made from vast profits, police say.

A few weeks later Towriss was detained in Doncaster after a police chase during which he threw a kilo block of cocaine from his vehicle.  He was found to be in possession of an encrypted phone and worked for the Din family - he had previously been seen by covert officers meeting Hassan Din, in the Rochdale area. He was Shazia Dinaposs son, who played a key part in the drugs operation, along with her sister, Abia. Towriss, , of Hartford Avenue, Heywood, was convicted in September of possessing cocaine with intent to supply possessing heroin with intent to supply possessing a controlled drug of Class A with intent to supply possessing cannabis with intent to supply driving when unfit through drink or drugs and dangerous driving.

From this week the first doses of the Pfizer vaccine will start to be administered. It will be a le-changing moment for those living under the darkest clouds of Covid. It means people who have been shielding will finally be able to leave their homes. It means families can be reunited, care home visits can be made without fear, and frontline health workers can be protected. In the long run, it offers the opportunity for le toto normal so we can wave goodbye to the days of social distancing. But vaccinations only workthe majority of people take them. As deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has warned, a low uptake of the jabs will almost certainly mean the restrictions will have to last longer. Some people have concerns about the safety of the new vaccines. This is partly because of the misleading information about inoculation that has been allowed to swirl unchecked across social media. But it is also because of a lack of faith in this government. That is why we should applaud celebrities who stepped forward to endorse the jab. By setting an example they will encourage more people to get vaccinated which, in turn, will help us contain the virus. The fact this paper has turned to A-listers for help in getting this message across is a damning reflection on the low standing of ministers.  It is a consequence of Boris Johnson lazily raising expectations and offering  hopes. He told us in July that le couldto normal by Christmas. It didn’t. He told us we could soonto offices and workplaces. We didn’t. He told us that a second lockdown in England was avoidable. It wasn’t. When public trust has never been more essential for the good of the country, the Prime Minister has squandered it. Cruellest cut Months of Covid restrictions have taken a terrible toll on people’s mental health across the whole nation. So it is inexplicable – not to say disgraceful – that the Government has decided to cut funding for the Time to Change charity. For years the Sunday Mirror has been proud to work with this brilliant organisation to raise awareness of mental health issues.

Firefighters from the Los Angeles County Fire Department attended a property in Century Circle, Lancaster, Calornia after reports of a gas leak. Once they arrived, they found the bodies of a -year-old boy and a -year-old girl. Detectives said the children were suffering from “lacerations and stab wounds” when their bodies were discovered. The mayor of Lancaster, R. Rex Parris, confirmed that both victims were decapitated, the Los Angeles Times reports. “It was pretty brutal,” he said. Their dad Maurice Taylor Sr., a personal trainer, was arrested on Friday and is being held in lieu of -million bond. Lt. Brandon Dean said the childrenaposs bodies were found in dferent bedrooms in the home. Dean added it was not clear for how long they had been dead, but said their deaths did not seem to be connected with a gas leak. Both parents were in the house when emergency services arrived. They were detained and brought in for questioning. The childrenaposs mum was questioned but has not been arrested, Dean said.  Two other children in the home were apparently uninjured but were taken to hospital as a precaution. LASD said it was working with the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services to place the two surviving children, according to the Daily Mail. It is not clear what led to the childrenaposs deaths but Tayloraposs clients said they became concerned during the week when he failed to show up for fitness sessions he had been running over Zoom. Howard Kern, an attorney who saw Taylor for sessions for several years, said he called the Los Angeles County Fire Department at .am on Friday as he was worried about a gas leak at his property.  He recalled: “I said, ‘I’m concerned. We are concerned about a possible gas leak. There are four children and two adults - and we are concerned about their safety.’” Of Taylor, Kern said: Think of the nicest person that you know, then multiply that by five. “He worked so hard to support himself. Unfortunately, we don’t know enough to say what happened or what didn’t happen.” Another client described the man as reliable and mellow.

The new mum said: At the time I was very pregnant and p***ed off and sassy, and I pretty much told her she’d have to get over it, and be excited for new context to be added to the name. And that was that... until my daughter was born. Now she will not talk to us. She has blocked my number. When I try to text her baby pictures, they are never aposdeliveredapos. She has been talking to people close to us about how hurt she is. She thinks I chose the name on purpose as some kind of a power move, or slight to her, which is just not true. All I wanted was to include my grandmotheraposs name in my daughteraposs name because thataposs always been important to me.

The UK is the first major western power to approve a vaccine for rollout, with the jab to start being made available to the most at risk on Tuesday.  Scientists in Europe and the US appeared to cast some doubt over Britainaposs regulatory processes, although the UK bodies insist no corners were cut. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said on Friday that the vaccinated should avoid public places and reduce their intake of medicine and alcohol, which could suppress the immune system, within the first  days after the first jab.

They had to be.Coming so soon after that horror show, the authorities had placed a huge amount of trust in Dundee to put on an event that would bring pride back to the national game.They were not disappointed.The senior police officer in charge of crowd control said: “I just can’t praise the supporters enough. In the park itself their behaviour was first-class.”An ambulance service spokesperson added: “We didn’t have to deal with any fighting before, during or after the match. The fans were excellent.”Dundonian blood wasn#t spilled but it flowed through this memorable occasion.A toss of the coin decided the match would be played at Dens, an outcome that would have been cheered more loudly by the United team than the “home” side because of their love of playing in their rivals’ backyard.Not only did the clubs both hail from the banks of the Tay but so did the referee, with local whistler Bob Valentine handed the honour in a gesture that deserves to be applauded even all these years later. It was a brave show of imagination from the blazers, not something you see too often.As well as bragging rights and silverware, a place in the next season’s Uefa Cup was on offer in this First Division v Premier League contest.Tom Lauchlen, then Scottish Football League president, went all-in on the award of the prestigious tie to the city.He said: “And so, on with the game, which is widely accepted as the most interesting confrontation in the history of the competition. No matter the outcome of today’s match, surely the citizens of Dundee in particular, and football in general, will benefit.”In a storyline that would have been at home in a Broons annual, a wedding was saved by the police just as kick-off approached.Margaret Etchells, of Sandeman Street, who lived just yards from Dens, was getting married at pm to Alexander Edwards in SS Peter and Paul Church. An area in front of her house was cleared for taxis and a police escort was laid on to get her to the church on time as masses of fans converged on the stadium.The scene for the match – the sporting one this time # was set in the programme by the stylish prose of that era’s football writers.The Courier’s long-serving reporter Tommy Gallacher touched on events in Glasgow earlier in the year, writing: “Dundee is being presented with a heaven-sent opportunity to prove to everyone that intense rivalry need not be associated with violence of any kind. If Dundee and Dundee United achieve this then, regardless of the outcome, there may be broken hearts but no real losers.”Locally-based journalist John Mann, working for the Daily Star at the time, declared: “On this unique day, Dundee is the capital of Scottish football.”The late, great Dick Donnelly provided a superb article on Tannadice boss Jim McLean that must have given United fans reading it goosebumps as they awaited kick-off.He wrote: “It was nine years ago last Wednesday that the Dens Park coach made the short trip across the road to Tannadice to succeed Jerry Kerr as manager. Long enough hidden away in the backwoods of our national sport, United have, during McLean’s reign, progressed almost beyond all recognition.”As usual, Dick was correct and United would go on to reach even greater heights under McLean both at home and abroad.A huge part of the club’s success was, of course, down to legendary captain Paul Hegarty.The central defender, even  years on, looks back on that day with enormous pride.Famously, he chose not to be first to lt the cup himself but instead gted the honour to long-serving keeper Hamish McAlpine, a generous gesture agreed upon by every other player without the goalie’s prior knowledge.By coincidence, the aforementioned match programme had a sketch of Hamish on its front page, holding the cup along with Dark Blues’ number one Bobby Geddes.Maybe someone knew something the rest of us didn’t…Recalling, four decades on, how he decided to make a skipper’s sacrice on one of his proudest days in tangerine, Hegarty said: “We had discussed it as a group before the game, without Hamish being involved.“We were conscious of tempting fate because anything can happen in finals but we wanted to have a plan in place just in case.“The decision was taken to let Hamish lt the trophywe won because of the service he had given United.“He had been through all the ups and downs over the years and we wanted to give him recognition.“I didn’t think twice about it.“It had happened in Spain a few times at the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid soit was good enough for them it was good enough for us.“We had a magnicent club servant in Hamish and wanted to do what’s right by him.“When the time came I said to him to go ahead of me and, after some reluctance, Hamish enjoyed his moment.”The teams were:Dundee: Bobby Geddes, Les Barr, Erich Schaedler, Cammy Fraser, Bobby Glennie, George McGeachie, Peter Mackie, Ray Stephen, Eric Sinclair, Billy Williamson , Andy Geddes .Dundee United: Hamish McAlpine, Dave Narey, Iain Phillip, John Holt, Paul Hegarty, Frank Kopel, Eamonn Bannon, Willie Pettigrew, Davie Dodds, Paul Sturrock, Graeme Payne.Referee: Bob Valentine.Attendance: ,.Scorers: Dodds , Sturrock .Hegarty took us on a walk through the game asit had happened yesterday.After the Dark Blues had a Sinclair “goal” chalked off for a foul, Dodds put the Tangerines ahead right before half-time.Sturrock then pounced twice for United following two Hegarty headers, the first hitting the bar and the second parried by keeper Geddes.The United captain recalled: “Doddsie scored just before half-time with his header and I was behind him when he put it in – don’t ask why I was so high up the pitch.“They had the ball in our net before that but there was a foul on Hamish so that didn’t count.“It had been reasonably even until we took the lead so to score at such a vital time was brilliant for us.“I played a big part in our next two goals, with Luggyscoring after two of my headers.“For the first I got good contact on the corner but it smacked off the bar and came down for Luggy to nod into the net.“Because of how that goal had been scored, I was surprised when I got room inside the box again to put in another header, which was saved before Luggy made sure again.“I was just glad that he was in the right place at the right time, not once but twice.#Hegarty added: “I think it was a pretty comfortable victory in the end.“My main emotion at the final whistle was relief because you want the job done.“I was so happy for the United fans because it was a cup win against their rivals – a Dundee derby as well as being a final.“Can you imagineit hadn’t gone our way “We would be reading articles nowadays about how Dundee upset the odds. We couldn’t have put our supporters through that!”Hegarty pinpointed the previous season’s final against Aberdeen and that year’s semi-final second leg - success away to Celtic as the two performances that gave the Tangerines the edge for this one.He said: “It is hard to explain just how much confidence and momentum we took from having won the trophy the year before.“In the first final match at Hampden against Aberdeenwe actually carried a lot of luck and they were the better side on the day.“That all changed when we went to Dens for the replay, though, and we ran out deserved winners against an excellent Aberdeen team.“We were just a confident bunch back then and believed in our ability as a group of players.“What helped enormously for the Dundee final was having won our first bit of silverware just  months previously.“We were over that first hurdle and were feeling good about going back across the road, a pitch that suited our style of play.“Also, we had recorded an exceptional result in the semi-final by beating Celtic - at Parkhead after a draw at Tannadice in the first game. You always took heart from winning in Glasgow against one of the Old Firm.“On the day, there was some pressure on us because we were favourites but it wasn’t a problem because of that self-belief.”The late and much-missed Ron Scott, reporting from the Dens final under his Sunday Post byline Bill McFarlane, spoke to McLean after full-time.The victorious boss typically deflected praise away from himself.Instead, McLean picked out Graeme Payne for a special mention, having left him out of his line-up for the  success against Aberdeen.McLean told Ron: “I won the League Cup for my we, two sons and especially Graeme Payne.#Paul Sturrock was the man of the match but I’m delighted for Graeme. He typies the best of Scottish football.“I had to leave him out of last season’s final for tactical reasons…so I’m exceptionally pleased he had his moment of glory here.”He also caught up with Dundee manager Donald Mackay and got an answer to the question every Dark Blues’ fan was asking when their team was read out: “Where was winger Jimmy Murphy ”Ron reported Mackay as saying: “United treated the game like the cup-tie it was. We didn’t. It was as simple as that.”Asked about Murphy’s omission, Mackay added: “Jimmy was disciplined after Wednesday’s reserve game against Raith Rovers.#Players cannot be allowed to play for Dundee when they feel like it. They must produce the whole time.”Murphy’s absence was all the more extraordinary because of the starring role he had played in the games that got the Dens men to the final.He scored a penalty in the shootout at Rugby Park when they edged past Kilmarnock in the third round tormented Aberdeen at Pittodrie as Cammy Fraser’s goal sealed a superb quarter-final success and covered every blade of grass in the - semi-final, second leg thriller against Ayr United at Dens.For one Tannadice player, the success earned him a noteworthy city double.Just seven years previously, midfielder Iain Phillip was in the Dundee team that lted the League Cup at Hampden by beating Celtic thanks to Gordon Wallace’s goal.Now he was in the United side, collecting a medal at the expense of his former club.The last word on the Friendly Final goes to an unnamed but happy United fan, who called the Sunday Post office that night from the Vennel Bar on the city’s Hilltown.No doubt helped by a pint or two, he reported: “There are  Dundee and United supporters here and we’re all having a sing-song and enjoying ourselves. Put this on your front page. It’s the sort of thing that does the city proud.”~ First round, first leg East Fe  United .Scorers: Milne , Ward, Sturrock , Narey.Second leg United  East Fe .Scorers: Ward , Hegarty, Payne.United won - on aggregate.~ Second round, first leg United  Cowdenbeath .Scorers: Bannon , Sturrock, Hegarty.Second leg Cowdenbeath  United .Scorers: Hegarty, Ward , Sturrock.United won - on aggregate.~ Third round, first leg Motherwell  United .Scorer: Addison.Second leg United  Motherwell  .Scorers: Sturrock , Holt, Milne.United won - on aggregate.~ Quarter-final, first leg Clydebank  United .Scorer: Bannon.Second leg United  Clydebank .Scorers: Ward , Sturrock, Hegarty.United won - on aggregate.~ Semi-final, first leg United  Celtic .Scorer: Bannon.Second leg Celtic  United .Scorers: Pettigrew, Sturrock, Dodds.United won - on aggregate.~ Second round, first leg Dundee  Arbroath .Scorer: Fletcher .Second leg Arbroath  Dundee .Scorers: Sinclair, Fletcher, MacLaren.Dundee won - on aggregate.~ Third round, first leg Dundee  Kilmarnock .Second leg Kilmarnock  Dundee .Dundee won - on pens.

It’s just a good bit of recognition for all the work which is extra-curricular for our day-to-day work.“It’s about giving people that appropriate voice as well. If you look at other businesses and associations they join together to amply their voice so when I reference Aberdeen Hospitality Together I am speaking on behalf of  other businesses which are in our sector which allows us to solidy the points we want to get across and speak on behalf of others who, on their own, might not have as loud a voice otherwise.”The initiatives focused on by the group, in particular dealing with the drastic effect the Covid- outbreak has had on businesses, have given licensees a bigger voice.“This particular group was formed during the local lockdown we went through in August. We initially set up a standard that all our licensed premises would follow, a -step plan that went above and beyond the government guidelines and how we would operate to show that we were doing something proactive and dferent to any other city,” added Stuart.“In the first instance it was to get the city open again and since then we have made positive representation across a number of issues – a failed campaign, essentially, to try and get an extension to Eat Out to Help Out for Aberdeen and then working across the national groups who are having conversations with the Scottish Government to filter in the dficulties that we are experiencing.“We were very influential when the central belt was locked down as their funding was dferent to the funding that we received in Aberdeen so we made demonstration on that to say that we needed to see parity here as there was no dference in the value of the business. We were closed for the sameso we should receive the same amount of funding, so we were able to get backdated funding for that.“On a weekly basis, I meet with the local authority, environmental health, the police and all the stakeholders who would be involved in this to ensure there isn’t a repeat of the first lockdown we went through so that is very useful as we can get together and any things that are forthcoming, we can discuss any potential issues and how we can tackle them and I can communicate that back to all the venues that I speak to.“It’s a very fluid situation which we put together because it was a necessity and I think the work we are going to be doing over the next month and into January is going to be about solidying and seeing what we can do to benefit the city in the future.”With the tiers system now in place, the hard work continues for Stuart as he attempts to find ways for businesses to operate under tough conditions with the hope that they survive.“Nobody asks you to do that work that I have been doing # you do it out of the goodness of your heart. There was a need to set standards to try and promote Aberdeen as a safe place as in after the first lockdown rebuilding customer confidence,” Stuart continued.“But in the longer term there is so much good that a group like this can do and there are a lot of positives that the hospitality sector bring to the economy and the ecosystem of a city centre and we are seeing that being challenged on a daily basis at the moment.“We hope that this will be shortlived and the vaccine will be coming over the hill and we can get back to some sort of normality in the spring time. It will just be down to who survives the distance between now and then.“The hope is that as many people as possible do, but given that things are changing on a weekly basis at the moment our main campaign on a Scottish level is a bit more of a levelling out of the tiers and levelling the playing field so that even level three areas have the potential to trade slightly longer.“We have moved away from managing the risk around Covid, but we have brought about a rather damaging economic policy that does need to be constructively challenged.#We are not here about saying who’s right and who’s wrong. It is about engaging in constructive conversation with the people who the policy directly impact and seeing from them first hand what can be done under the current restraints to improve things.”The  Scottish Bar  Pub awards blazed a trail by going virtual for the first time in  years last Wednesday.Hundreds of industry operators, staff and, for the first time, members of the public from Applecross to Dumfries tuned in live to gather on a virtual red carpet.A record , people voted this year and host showbiz journalist Beverley Lyons presented a total of  awards with unsuspecting recipients surprised by a knock at the door and a socially distanced congratulations from one of the awards team.Scotland’s longest-running industry “Oscars” are organised by publishers of DRAM and this one was determined to honour the fighting spirit and resilience of the people that make up Scotland’s hospitality industry during this heavy Covid weather as well as their all-round excellence like they usually do.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

The majority felt positively about the priorities with % of respondents positive about the need to prioritise ‘Caring for Carers’ and ‘Knowing who to turn to’. No respondents disagreed with the priorities outlined.#Respondents generally felt that managing the impact of isolation for people with dementia and carers during the pandemic, knowing who to turn to and Caring for Carers should be the immediate priorities.#In addition, professionals have highlighted the backlog of people awaiting dementia diagnosis and subsequent support as a result of services, including brain scanning services, being put on hold during the initial lockdown phase of the pandemic.#Restrictions on face to face contact and the requirement for use of PPE also pose challenges for clinicians in assessing and diagnosing dementia.#The health and social care partnership has also set out its key actions to take forward in  .These include raising awareness within Aberdeenshire around the importance and benefits of seeking a diagnosis of dementia, manage the backlog dementia assessment referrals due to Covid-, and develop and monitor ongoing delivery of post-diagnostic support services.It also hopes to increase the use of appropriate digital technology to improve access to support for people living with dementia, review the holistic services currently in place with Alzheimer Scotland and consider requirements for the future, as well as work with those who have young onset dementia to develop appropriate support services.As the plan is long-term, it may take some time to see actions and changes come into force.The health and social care partnership also added that while there have been set backs as a result of the Covid- pandemic, it is estimated that the key actions and priorities are achievable in the timeframe.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

However, with the lighter balls, players can hit them from further out and they move more in the air.“I would assume it maybe took a wee dip before it got to Joe.“It is a lot easier to happen than in my era due to the type of ball.”During a -year-Dons career, Clark racked up  appearances.Scotland international defender Andy Considine broke into the top five in the Betfred Cup loss to St Mirren, moving level on  with club legend Jim Leighton.He will move ahead of Leighton at St Mirren today – and is just  games behind Clark.Although Considine’s contract expires at the end of this season, there is an appearance related clause that would secure another season at the club.Considine is on course to meet that clause and could close in on Clark’s tally.Clark, , said: “Andy is catching up with me.“He is having a great Indian summer, which is fabulous.“Andy deserves it as he is a one-club man and also a local boy.“I played with his dad Doug during my time at Aberdeen.“It has been nice to see Andy doing well and he plays with so much enthusiasm.#It was a great reward to see him getting his Scotland debut.”Aberdeen will today bid to end a three-game winless streak. During that run Lewis Ferguson, Ross McCrorie and Connor McLennan were absent as they were self-isolating due to a Covid- outbreak in the Scotland Under- squad.Ferguson and McLennan willtoday, although McCrorie will be unavailable until next Saturday’s clash with Ross County.Clark said: “There have been injuries, and the Covid situation coming into play made it dficult.“It will be good for them to have Ferguson and McLennan back.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"online focus for feis an tairbeirt","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space, who cut into the box and picked out MacEwan, who was foiled from six yards by Lewis. The keeper couldn#t hold the shot, and the ball eventually fell to Gavin Forgrieve, who tapped home from four yards.Nine minutes from time Saints midfielder Bonar, a key member of Red Star#s  Premier Division Two title-winning side, passed to MacEwan, who beat the keeper with a deft chip from  yards.Match report and photographs: Derek Black"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Surely to goodness we should have a plan.#I am also quite annoyed that Fyne View has closed, because it cost a lot to get it up and running, so that is money down the drain.#The public want to have facilities in their area and we cannot have decisions made without proper focus on figures before us.#Fyne View was a Lochgilphead-based care facility for dementia sufferers which was revealed to have closed its doors in November.Caroline Cherry, head of adult services with the HSCP, responded: #I totally hear Ms Rhodick’s concerns. But the purpose of this paper is not to go over decisions that have been made, it is to look at the audit trail.#Ms Rhodick then said: #Councillor Gary Mulvaneyhas said that the decision has been taken and the report reiterates that.#But it didn’t matter how many times people pled with the board to listen and understand, especially in a smaller area like this.#The consultation was not a consultation. People were asked along for their views and officers turned and told the public what they were doing. They were putting the cart before the horse.#The community will be really angry as nobody is listening. The decision was made months ago with one public consultation.

Evenyou are a non-believer or one who doubts in the existence of God, you can always say #Godyou are there please, please come and help me#.Give it a go and not only will it give you relief from boredom and loneliness when you pray but numerous other benefits will accrue – and, of course, dipping into a Bible will enrich your prayer enormously.Calum MacFarlane-Barrow, Dalmally."},{"url":null,"title":"oh christmas tree","story":"Kathie GrfithsUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But, usually, it means yoursquoll find it more dficult to exercise your rights.This applies even where we see a rapid purchase of a company thatrsquos gone into administration, where on the surface it looks like itrsquos businesses as usual.Can Iitems to a retailer thats gone into administration It depends. Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up - you may still receive it.Check the terms and conditions to see whether the offer is backed by the manufacturer , or whether the cashback claim should be made to the retailer.If the manufacturer is providing the cashback, your claim shouldnt be affected.If its the retailer, you could still put in a claim and they would be in breach of contractthey didnt send the cash.If you didnt get the cash, unfortunately, you couldnt take court action against the retailer while its in administration.If at the end of the administration the retailer stopped trading, youd need to lodge your claim for unpaid cashback with the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-recorded-nearly-300-cases-past-month","story":"NEARLY  cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the past month.Data published by the Scottish Government at pm todayshows the Borders has recorded  new cases in the last  hours, bringing the regional total since March to .On November , a total of  cases had been confirmed since the beginning of the pandemic, meaning that, in the space of a month, the Borders has recorded  new cases.:Coronavirus: Borders school announces positive caseIn Scotland, the total number of cases since March now stands at ,.In the last  hours across Scotland, there have been  deaths where COVID-has been mentioned on the death certicate.In the Borders, the number of patients in hospital with the virus has increased since yesterdayfrom nine to ."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-mcdonalds-reveals-number-jobs-available","story":"McDONALDrsquoS has revealed the number of jobs that will be created once its new Borders site opens.As reported last week, a new restaurant and drive-thru will be coming to Hawickafter plans were approved by Scottish ministers.The fast food giant has now revealed that ldquoat least  new jobs will be created.:Galashiels loses crown as happiest place to live in ScotlandA McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore delighted that our plans for a new drive-thru restaurant in Hawick have been approved.ldquoWe look forward to opening our doors in the near future, bringing signicant investment to the local community and creating at least  new jobs.The Hawick site on Commercial Road, where the McDonaldrsquos is to be built, will also see a BM store added.There is currently one McDonaldrsquos store in the Borders, which opened in Galashiels in .You might also be interested in:Coronavirus: Borders recorded nearly  casesin the last monthTwo Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesCoronavirus: Borders school announces positive case"},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-knowepark-primary-school-announces-coronavirus-case","story":"AN ENTIRE class at a Borders school has been forced to self-isolate following a coronavirus case.On Sunday , parents of pupils in the P P composite class at Knowepark Primary School, Selkirk, were informed of a positive case at the school.The NHS Test and Protect team identied the whole class as being in close contact with the case, and all pupils were therefore required to self-isolate.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Councilsaid that three other schools in the Borders have also reported cases recently.:Two Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesHawick High School and Galashiels Academyhave each announced a single case, while Ayton Primary School has \"a small number of cases\", according to the spokesperson.The spokesperson said cases associated with Ayton Primary School have \"implications for a number of iniduals within the school\".\"Currently no [Ayton] pupils [are] required to self-isolate,\" the spokesperson added.Parents at Hawick High School and Galashiels Academy were informed of cases on November , and parents of children at Ayton Primary School were told about cases on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-scotrail-offers-students-50-per-cent-discount-get-home-christmas","story":"SCOTRAIL has announced that students travelling home over Christmas will benefit from a fty per cent discount on tickets from Scotlandrsquos Railway.A mass testing programme of students planning to head home over the festive period is currently under way, in a bid to limit risk of transmission and provide reassurance to those travelling home to their families and loved ones.And now students will only need to pay half price for travel, on any ScotRail service until December .The train operator, run by Dutch firm Abellio, hopes the move will help students worried about getting home to their families under the current coronavirus travel restrictions.Students will first need to record a negative Covid- test before travelling, which could make it dficult to book specic train services due to testing appointments and the time spent awaiting results.Herersquos a little Christmas cheer for all of Scotlandrsquos university students.

This really is it. Nothing .An alternative is to mix up a saltwater solution, soak a towel in it and leave the towel on the windscreen overnight.You might also want to leave the engine running while you de-ice your car, but this poses safety issues and may also be in breach of the Highway Code which states you must not leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily while that vehicle is stationary on a public road.Theres also the risk the vehicle could get stolenthe keys are left in the ignition.The AA says:Get up at least  minutes early to give you time to prepare the car.Donrsquot drive off like a tank-commander, with a tiny hole cleared in the windscreen.Clear all windows using a scraper and de-icer.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows. A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us.

Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraising star lights up the night","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Both schools have demonstrated rich, engaging and ied STEM experiences for learners.#Science Minister Richard Lochhead said: #Many congratulations to those schools who have achieved STEM Nation Awards.#The efforts of those schools to offer pupils the chance to develop skills and awareness of STEM subjects will open up fantastic career opportunities to them and help to make sure that the workforce of the future is equipped to protect Scotland’s reputation as a true science and technology nation.#Argyll and Bute Council’s policy lead for education, Councillor Yvonne McNeilly, said: #Here in Argyll and Bute, we have a track record for excellence in STEM learning experiences in our schools. With local key sectors that include creative industries, aquaculture and renewable energy, it’s important that our young people are well-equipped with skills our economy needs for the future – either at home or further afield.#So, congratulations to Port Ellen and Bowmore primaries, and good luck to North Bute Primary which I know has just completed the first step in achieving this award.#"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are probably no more than half-a-dozen casks of -year-old Scotch whisky in existence.It is the habit at Springbank to reserve small quantities of whisky for longer than normal maturity. Although  years is not so very uncommon,  years is exceptional.The particular cask was ‘refill sherry hogshead’ which was filled on December  , with Springbank at a strength of . over proof .It originally contained the equivalent of . proof gallons but more than  years later, maturation had taken most of the spirit away: there was only the equivalent of . proof gallons left, and the strength had dropped to . proof.The out-turn of the bottling operation was  cases and one bottle. These will have a special label and each numbered bottle will carry a certicate inidually signed by the company’s chairman Mr Hedley G Wright, whose great-grandfather founded the present company. Unfortunately it is improbable that any of this whisky # after all there are only  bottles # will be seen by the retail trade the price would be astronomical anyway.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIslay distilleriesLast working season was a prosperous one for the Islay distilleries, as well as for Highlands distilleries generally.During the summer great activity has been seen in the numerous arrivals of vessels with coal and barley and preparations were made for a resumption of distilling.Wet weather, scarcity of labour and a scarcity of carts made the securing of peats very dficult, and only the dry autumn relieved the situation and allowed the peats to be got home. At Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Port Ellen, Port Charlotte, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila work is now actively going on, and large deliveries are leaving the district.Highland distillers, however, have now to face the competition again of the distillers of grain whisky, which is now plentul on the market. The Distillers Co Ltd quotes its grain whisky at five shillingsper gallon and with all the high costs of wages, coal repairs etc which encumber the malt distillers, the competition is likely to be severely felt."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

What started as a personal challenge for David Brown has motivated not only himself but many others to raise money for charity as they keep fit.Many members of the charities for which David has raised money in  have supported him by completing their own runs and walks, the latest being Tom Donnachy, who features on our back page.The fundraising efforts of the three young girls who completed a K walk last weekend also inspired two businesses # Deliciously Scottish Eggs and Jura Community Stores # to donate money to Children st.Finally, it is heartening to hear of the community coming together to help dog Rogan who suffers from cancer.No matter what le throws at us, we can be sure our community will support us."},{"url":null,"title":"letters december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town#s heart was broken earlier this year, as it has been many, many times before.#As a community we have all pulled together and slowly but surely we are healing and showing the strength that comes from within such a tight-knit and loving community.#So many people have been helping one another to get through this as well as those who have worked in a iety of occupations, every single day # and so hard # throughout this strange time for us all the volunteers who have given their time freely to help so many of the community everyone who has kept this wee town going # you have all been amazing.#This has been the toughest of years that our young generation has seen. They have been affected in many ways, some of which have still to appear, and many have really struggled.#Everything became virtual # what a blessing technology has been for all of us to keep in touch and stay connected.#For all these reasons above, this is why it was so important to us, that although we would not be able to have our usual ‘switch on’, we had to make sure the lights were up and Santa came to see the wee ones. It was wonderful to see so many people out on the street. Everyone needed a bit of cheer and a bit of magic.#The group thanked the following iniduals and companies for their assistance: RDS Forestry, P McKerral and Co, Kevin McCrae, Jack Campbell, McKinven and Colville, Clark Lafferty, Stevie Gorman, Barry Colville, George MacMillan, Ryan McLachlan, Kintyre Hire, Jim McPhee, Graeme Harvey, Community Service, Helen Gilchrist, Campbeltown Coop, Tesco, The Original Factory Shop and the one and only Santa and his helpers.#Without you all, this would never have happened,# the spokesperson added. #Thank you from the bottom of our grateful hearts.#Santa is toto Kintyre tomorrowevening, to visit children in some of the villages surrounding Campbeltown so keep a look out for him."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We would do as much as we could for people who were unwell in hospital then continue their rehabilitation with them in their home environment.#Kate explained that the role has changed a lot in recent years because of advances in medicine and preventative care meaning fewer people require treatment.The Covid- pandemic has also caused changes in the last few months, during which time Kate has been working from home, assessing clients over the phone before her colleagues treat them.Kate, who was born and brought up in Kintyre, described her job as #very rewarding# but added: #Now just seemed the right time to go. I’ve enjoyed my work completely, working with all the clients.#Asked about her plans for retirement, Kate said: #I’ve got three wee grand-daughters, including a wee one who is just five weeks old, so I’ll spend more time with them and help out their parents,possible.#I’d like to thank all my colleagues and clients over the years.#Linda Currie, Argyll and Bute lead allied health professional, told the Courier: #We would like to wish Kate a well-earned and very happy retirement.

Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up - you may still receive it.Check the terms and conditions to see whether the offer is backed by the manufacturer , or whether the cashback claim should be made to the retailer.If the manufacturer is providing the cashback, your claim shouldnt be affected.If its the retailer, you could still put in a claim and they would be in breach of contractthey didnt send the cash.If you didnt get the cash, unfortunately, you couldnt take court action against the retailer while its in administration.If at the end of the administration the retailer stopped trading, youd need to lodge your claim for unpaid cashback with the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-tiers-no-changes-east-lothian-remains-level-2","story":"That means neighbouring Midlothian will remain in Level  Covid restrictions for another week after the First Minister said no changes would be made this week.Speaking to the Scottish Parliament today , Nicola Sturgeon said that good progress was being made in pushing down the spread of coronavirus across Scotland.While East Lothian stays in Level , hopes that neighbouring Midlothian would join it were dashed as the First Minister saidthere was still a need to ldquostrengthen and solidy the progress made.She told MSPs: ldquoThe sacrices everyone is making are making a dference, they are getting case numbers down, reducing the numbers getting ill and needing hospital care, and so protecting the NHS and saving lives.ldquoAlthough we are encouraged by the impact current restrictions have had, the need to strengthen and solidy that progress means we should continue to take care and err on the side of caution.Ms Sturgeon said that no local authority would see a level change this week following a weekly review but indicated changes were likely to be brought in next week.That means Edinburgh also remains in Level  and West Lothian in Level ."},{"url":null,"title":"100-new-affordable-homes-delivered-east-lothian-year","story":"Tenants have been collecting keys to  new council houses which East Lothian Council took ownership of in Haddington in the last few months, with a further  on the same estate due to be handed over by the end of this year.However, the local authority has revealed that despite the closure of construction sites for large parts of the year, it has continued to bring forward affordable housing.SInce September, the council has also taken ownership of seven new homes in Dunbar and  at Pinkie, Musselburgh.And during the year, six homes at Dovecot, Haddington, and  new homes at Limeylands, Ormiston, were handed over to East Lothian Housing Association for social rent.An additional  new extra-care council houses at Elder Street, Tranent, are due to be handed over to East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.The latest handover of  homes at Letham Mains in Haddington, one of the largest new developments in East Lothian, includes two wheelchair-accessible homes.Justine Holmes, who got the keys to her new home at Letham Mains in September, is delighted and says the move has been le-changing for her and her two children.Justine, , said: ldquoWe have had a hard three years.

They fret about meeting their familyrsquos expectations, and weeks-long Christmas food advertising campaigns pump up that anxiety. These adverts work as effectively on women as the Christmas toy equivalent work on children.And this year, the annual festive food pressure dial has been turned up to maximum setting. Memories of bare supermarket shelves during the first lockdown haunt us. The feeling that we must, against all odds, make this a successful Christmas to reassure ourselves, and our nearest and dearest, that deep down, everything is fine.Apologies to those relatively few men who take on the responsibility for planning and providing, but this is heavy burden that mainly women feel.Of course, this festive anxiety is orced from reality. There are shops other than supermarkets, independent shops. They usually sell better food, and they donrsquot run out. There are any number of smaller producers and distributors of first-rate food who would be delighted to have our online business.So letrsquos try to keep a cool head.

Itrsquos known in Gaelic as Gleann Shith, the Glen of the Fairies, but itrsquos also the glen of the red deer, which graze on grasses, sedges, heather and woody plants and live in the Cairngorms in large herds. Except for during mating season the deer tend to stay in single sex groups and this image shows four stags foraging for food on a hillside which already has its first covering of snow, their antlers picked out in silhouette against the winter sky.If the image seems familiar or evokes a response therersquos a reason. Just under  years ago, in , the English painter Edwin Landseer journeyed north from his home on London to enjoy the first of several visits to the Highlands. It was during one of these that he made the sketch that would become his most famous work: The Monarch Of The Glen, completed in  as part of a three-painting commission for what was euphemistically known as the Refreshment Room at the House Of Lords. When the ermine-clad peers refused to stump up the pound fee, The Monarch Of The Glen passed through a iety of private hands and eventually ended up in the Scottish National Gallery. By then it had become roaringly popular and emblematic of what you might call the ldquobiscuit tin view of Scotland.Landseerrsquos stag has  points, or tines, to its antlers, making it a Royal stag rather the Monarch iety, which tend to have  points . An Imperial stag, meanwhile, would have  points. None of ours look like they can even muster , though they are no less impressive a sight for it.That said, you might smell them before you see them, especiallythey are present in numbers.

Such is the controversial message from Francesca Osowska, the chief executive of NatureScot, formerly known as Scottish Natural Heritage. In some quarters shersquoll be preaching to the converted. Gardeners whose summers are ruined by weekly or fortnightly grass cutting, who would rather spend their time dead-heading roses or sipping Pimms on the patio, will surely leap at the idea.Osowskarsquos plea is not for gardens to be left to run wild, but for those of us with a bit of lawn to set aside an area to sprout, untouched by the mower. In these corners, weeds and wildflowers, and the insects, birds and other creatures that live off them will flourish.But her vision is for wilderness or wildness to be embraced more broadly than by devotees of the Beechgrove Garden. If redesigned, urban areas, which contain swathes of parkland as well as private gardens, could also help rewild the country. If parks were kept less like Centre Court at Wimbledon and more like a stretch of meadow or marsh you might find in the heart of the countryside, towns and cities could soon be alive with the sound of birdsong and bees.Osowskarsquos ambition is to spark a radical sht ndash you might call it a renaissance ndash in the way we see parks and gardens. Changing our perspective, she hopes, will not only help wildle but signicantly benefit humankind too. She believes the Covid  crisis, for instance, can be directly linked to the shrinking acreage allowed for nature. As she explains: ldquoThe increasing intensity of livestock farming, deforestation, crop monocultures, globalisation and large urban environments all make viral transference more likely and rapid once viruses enter human populations. Give more room to the wild, she suggests, and as balance is restored, the risk of viruses crossing barriers from animal to human, as in the recent case of Danish mink farms, will be reduced.Whatever the science of pandemics, and the validity of Osowskarsquos conclusions, for most of us the idea of letting things run amok at the bottom of the garden already makes sense. We donrsquot need the carrot or stick incentive of warding against another global pandemic to commit to a bit of scrubland. In fact, the wilding memo has been in circulation among gardeners for decades. Many were fighting a rearguard action against climate change and loss of bioersity long before it became fashionable. This silent army, in fleeces and wellington boots, has been largely unsung, but the rewards have been rich. The abundance of flora and fauna that populated their gardens turned them into a communal space in the widest sense.Reshaping our ideas of civic parks might be a bigger challenge. Irsquove always found immaculate flowerbeds and bowling green grass faintly depressing, a pale imitation of the countryside and its teeming fields and woods. A pale imitation, indeed, of my own garden, where unkemptness has been elevated to an art form. Yet for some, the word park is synonymous with symmetry and order, with every begonia in its place, like an immaculate table setting, and the lawns to be admired but not trodden.Even so, Irsquod say Osowska is pressing on an open door. Formality, in almost every sphere of le, is becoming a thing of the past. The days of parkies yelling at those who stepped off the path now seem almost comical. Most of us, I am sure, would prefer a more casual landscape, less geometrical, more random. How much more relaxing to take a stroll in a place where grasses and bushes sway in the wind, shrubberies are tangled and dense, and the sound of birdsong and of children running through the long grass drowns out the strimmer or chainsaw.Itrsquos amazing how swtly new ideas about outdoor space take hold. A century ago, most peoplersquos gardens were more like allotments, primarily for growing fruit and veg, with flowers and shrubs a decorative indulgence. Lawn for leisure or aesthetic pleasure was a luxury. When the mood changed, and gardens became an outdoor room, the lettuce bed and potato drills were banished. Now, as the pendulum swings back to a point somewhere between the two, awareness about giving nature more space is catching on. Butthe prospect of untamed grass and weeds dismays you, there are countless other ways of nurturing nature.When it comes to green spaces, the climate emergency has opened peoplersquos eyes to the importance of creative mess, of not sweeping and tidying every inch asit were our kitchen, but allowing it to breathe. Something as simple as a heap of undisturbed leaves, a bundle of sticks or wall of logs, allows hedgehogs and other mammals to survive the winter. Rotting foliage and flowers run to seed are a breakfast buffet for birds and insects, who in turn are prey for other hungry wildle. In spring and summer, therersquos nothing richer for flying insects than nettles which, being so quick to replenish themselves, are also good for soup. Or so neighbours tell me.But in case you are about to throw away the key to the garden shed, this is not an excuse for letting nature take over. Some husbandry is essential, to ensure plants and trees thrive to the best of their abilities, and are not overpowered by the thugs of the undergrowth.So the lawnmower is by no means the greatest threat to our future. Itrsquos not something I can get rid of, since we donrsquot own one. Butwe did not have the grass trimmed throughout the summer by a roving gardener whose machine is tough enough to cut a path through heather, it would be thigh-high by the start of June. Green-fingered friends who regularly trim their grass use the cuttings for compost, thereby improving the soil. In other words, all grass is good. And no matter how you let yours grow, whether it is buzzcut or left to its own devices, it is infinitely better than covering the ground in concrete or stone. Soon we will look back on gardens turned into car parks with disbelief. How could we suffocate the land like this  In the meantime, long may your weeds and wallflowers grow ."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-coming-new-dawn-suffused-happiness-give-thanks","story":"I electronically raise my shutters and myself, and look out to the still darkness and watch it gradually change content with its progress.Nurses come and go in a choreographed routine ndash pills, thermometer reading and then breakfast of good bread, butter, jam and cold, cold orange juice.

I have seen first-hand that for many men and women who have left prison, or are in the process of transitioning out, their first point of call is SISCO. This transition from incarceration is unstable, and the statistical evidence of re-offending within Scotland is one of the highest in Western Europe. To combat this, we have placed a whole-person approach to recovery initiatives at the core of our charity model, where multiple pathways are offered to iniduals caught up in the cycle of addiction. Recovery Cafes are an integral component of this approach, and are primarily peer-led and self-policed for prisoners, by prisoners, in order to ensure that they are at the heart of every decision that is made, and to offer a safe environment to address complex needs and the traumas associated with addiction.For many small third sector organisations, the pandemic has developed an adverse charitable climate rooted in a lack of public awareness, a lack of Government support, and extreme competition for charitable grants and funds. Grants and funds are few and far between, and alongside being highly competitive, large multi-million pound charities and organisations often monopolise them ndash meaning that smaller charities, have to fight even harder for an even smaller piece of a grant or fund. This paradigm of monopolisation is further exacerbated by obscure Government priorities and policies. Upon contacting several MSPs and ministers, including the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, we have been met with broken promises and an overall disinterest in our cause. Governmental support is vital to a cause like ours, support from MSPs and ministers offer direct connections to ious grants, funds, and most importantly to the general publicrsquos awareness. Without grants or ministerial support, the rate at which we can engage the wider public about our cause moves at a slower pace. Ultimately, this leads to a lack of public donations, awareness, and the stigma commonly attached to the men and women who have experienced imprisonment is left unchallenged.To ensure the future of our charity ndash and most likely many other small third sector organisations ndash the way economic, political, and social spheres interact with these organisations needs to change and adapt to the new conditions laid out by the pandemic. Grants and funds need to become more transparent in where funding is directed, which can be done by preventing the grant from pooling at the top, and instead, taking a trickle-down approach where the grant spreads to smaller organisations more effectively. MSPs and ministers need to demonstrate a more visible support for third sector organisations, and emphasise inclusivity in regards to what causes are deemed a priority. By addressing these issues, engagement and public awareness will increase which actively increases donations, discourse, and challenges the stigma attached to the experiences of incarceration.Samuel Marriott-Dowding is communications officer with SISCO"},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW   Marr names his movers and shakers in New Elizabethans  Any surprises ","story":"BBC iPlayer***WATCHING popular history can be a perilous game. The viewer has to keep an eye out for a gimmick-hungry presenter who might suddenly appear in fancy dress , or lurch into creeping Jesus mode .No such worries during New Elizabethans with Andrew Marr. Or so you might have thought.There he was at the despatch box in the Commons, telling us about Churchill addressing the house on the death of George VI. The PMs voice rang out in audio.Good old Andy. Class act. You can rely on him not to do anything so cheesy as a Churchill impersonation. And then he did. It was a cautionary reminder that no presenter can resist hamming it up given half a chance.Marrrsquos central idea, to be set out over three episodes, was that the ascent to the throne of Queen Elizabeth in  ushered in an era of huge change that led to the UK as we know it today. The transformation was led by iniduals he called ldquochange-makers or ldquonew Elizabethans.The first episode, shown last night, was titled ldquoBuilding a new Society. Step forward Jan Morris, Nancy Mitford, Diana Dors, Ruth Ellis and others. Marr promised to avoid the usual suspects in favour of ldquocurious and creative characters and for the most part he made good on that.But there were still some disappointingly obvious selections, such as Mary Whitehouse , and there was no-one to alarm even the most skittish of horses.A swaggering Weegie in the shape of Alan McGee was as rock and roll as the first episode could muster.McGee left school at  with one Orsquolevel, Marr told us. But like others during the Thatcher years he knew a good deal in the Enterprise Allowance when he saw it. Under this scheme the Government paid pound a week to anyone starting their own business.McGee used the money to found Creation Records.ldquoFor me, said Marr, ldquoAlan McGee is a true Elizabethan, both a product of the time and a powerful influence on the age. [He] tells us a lot about the shts to class and opportunity that were happening in Scotland and much of the rest of Britain during the s.The son of a mechanic and a shop worker, McGee came of working age when the old industries were gone and the new, service and leisure sectors were starting to boom.ldquoBy his early s he was a self-made millionaire, said Marr. After a night in King Tutrsquos in Glasgow he signed a popular beat combo by the name of Oasis. McGeersquos fame grew to the point where he was ldquowarmly embraced by the new, cool Britannia establishment led by Tony Blair. Cue *that* embarrassing footage of Noel Gallagher and McGee at a Downing Street reception.Another Scot makes an appearance in the final instalment, airing on December . Jimmy Reid is introduced as ldquothe shop steward with Elvis Presley hair.Marr recently named him as one of his top six New Elizabethans. He does not hide his admiration, telling viewers: ldquoJimmy Reid was one of the most compelling, charismatic and well-educated New Elizabethans of them all hellip He was determined to be a voice for the working classes and to recty what he saw as the deep injustices of British society.There is a clip from Reidrsquos famous ldquono bevvying speech and film of Billy Connolly, welder as was, turning up to show his support, as well as footage of the mass march to Glasgow Green.There are connections to Scotland where in the list, including Roy Jenkins, courtesy of his stint as MP for Hillhead, and the architect Zaha Hadid, the architectural visionary behind the Riverside Museum in Glasgow.Where Marr excelled was in creating a bigger picture, forging links through the ages. Thus a line was traced from Reid to Hadid via the Clyde, and from anti-nuclear campaigner Helen John to the march against the Iraq war.Surprisingly, given the title, the person least covered was the Queen herself. There were many shots of cheering crowds, though.Marr insisted there had been change in the monarchy, too.

Whilst a proportion has an anti-vax agenda, I suspect that many are simply fearful of being asked to take a vaccine that is based upon new technology and whilst testing has been undertaken it has been truncated and we have no idea what the medium to long-term implications will be,any.The Government and the scientic community reassure us that it is safe and have pushed through approval at breakneck speed.Sadly, history is pockmarked with numerous examples of safe medicines that have turned out to be far from that and we also know that governments are capable of leading us to war for the flimsiest of reasons. Trust needs to be earned.The television media uses vox pops to marginalise concerns by focusing upon the Jimmy-from-Glasgow types and their \"Ahm no takin the vaccine coz its made by aliens an ma heidll faw aff.\" Give us some credit for considered opinions, please.Like them or not, the daily party political health broadcasts have become the most important vector for communicating updates to the public and attract high viewership.It seems logical to me then to propose that the BBC and other news channels host a live debate where Government and state and corporate scientists can explain the science, what is in the vaccine and exactly how it works.It would only be fair to permit those within the scientic community who have concerns over safety and efficacy, assuming such exist, to have a formal  for their views with a respected member of the civil rights lobby also being permitted to balance the political narrative.Live debates are used for far more mundane purposes than a vaccine that will have implications for the whole nation.Equally,Government and science is sure that the vaccine is entirely safe then what do they have to fear by exposing the matter to full scrutiny Fraser Kelly, Glasgow G.WHAT a splendid article by Helen McArdle . It clearly explains that in medicine, as in le, nothing can be  per cent guaranteed. But had William Jenner not set in motion the principle of vaccination  years ago, we might still be living with the scourge of smallpox and many other diseases.During the summer, there occurred an event which should have made banner headlines throughout the worldndash the eradication of polio from the continent of Africa, due in no small part to the efforts of Rotary International and Bill Gatesrsquo money in the worldwide vaccination programme.Because of the lack of regulation and control over social media, the anti-vaxers exert undue influence over those who have had, who believe they have had, or who believe they might get, an adverse effect from a vaccine. It is obviously no consolation to those who have tragically lost loved ones in the current pandemic, but the actual death rate is only .% of the population. The Spanish flu it ainrsquot.Hopefully, everyone will be lining up to get the vaccines when they become available. The country cannot stay shut down indefinitely.John NE Rankin, Bridge of Allan.WITH many manufacturers of a Covid- vaccine at ious stages of development and testing, the winner may prove to be the one which can produce a safe and effective vaccine which will require only a single injection and which can be stored and distributed at temperatures at which other vaccines are usually handled.The logistical challenges which will be encountered in a global vaccination using any of the recently announced vaccines should not be underestimated. The uptake in less developed countries with scattered populations in remote areas served by limited transport make the search for an approved single-dose vaccine of great importance.

Despite social media appeals across a swathe of missing, lost and stolen pet pages, there have been no sightings and no news. Pinning down the precise number of dog thefts in Scotland is tricky. Police Scotland say their records of thefts do not break down incidents in a way that records inidual items ndash such as dogs.While without clear evidence in the form of CCTV images or eyewitness accounts, it is impossible to determine whether a dog was stolen, or simply took advantage of an open gate.But concern is mounting that a worrying spate of dog thefts across England - where incidents have soared since the start of lockdown in March, coinciding with rocketing demand for puppies and dogs - may begin to encroach on owners north of the border.And with pets fetching eye-watering prices on social media sites particularly among popular medium-sized breeds such as Cocker Spaniels and cross-bred lsquodesignerrsquo cockerpoos, the potential for thieves to line their pockets can be huge.ldquoA cockerpoo used to cost around pound, now itrsquos around pound,. A Cocker Spaniel that was pound is now pound, and a Jack Russell has gone from pound to pound,, says Katie McCandless-Thomas, who runs a Facebook page, Missing Pets, Perth and Kinross, Scotland.Her page recently led an appeal for four dogs stolen from two addresses in rural Perthshire on the same day in October. One, a Jack Russell called Harvey, was lted from his kennel at Meikleour while his stunned owner watched helplessly from his home.Harvey was later found, while of the other three, taken from nearby Forneth, West of Blairgowrie, two ndash both Jack Russells - were found nearly  miles away in the Midlands. The remaining dog, a Springer Spaniel, remains missing.A -year-old man was arrested and charged in connection with the two incidents.ldquoThis type of thing has gotten worse since the start of lockdown, adds Katie. ldquoDemand for dogs has spiralled, they are selling for at least double the price theyrsquod normally sell for, and I think dog theft is part of it all.ldquoThe price of puppies is fuelling demand for more pets and people are stealing dogs thinking itrsquos a quick way to sell them on.ldquoIt is bad enough to know your dog is missing, but when you suspect it has been deliberately taken, itrsquos a whole dferent situation.ldquoItrsquos devastating for the owners.ldquoThere is a feeling that someone has deliberately targeted their dog and all kinds of scenarios run through their head of what could be happening.In England, charity DogLost said dog thefts in England rose by  per cent between  March, when lockdown was announced, and  June, compared with the same time last year.Over the course of just two months  dogs were taken in Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire alone, raising concerns that organised gangs are targeting mostly pedigree and working dogs, with Cocker Spaniels top of the list.As a result, some English police forces have suggested owners change their dog-walking routines, fearing gangs might be watching popular routes.However, social media rumours that gangs mark pavements outside dog ownersrsquo homes with chalk or cable ties are thought to be misplaced. ldquoA lot of thefts are opportunistic, says Katie. ldquoPeople leave their dogs tied up outside a shop and someone just walks away with them.ldquoPeople think it wonrsquot happen to them, but it can.In West Lothian, dog owner Siobhan Lamont waits every day for news of Tyson, a nine-year-old Staffordshire Terrier, and year-old Staffy-Collie cross, Drax.

I went outside, and saw the gate, which had been locked, was open, she says.A series of mystery phone calls have added to her distress and heightened her concerns that the dogs ndash last spotted in nearby Fauldhouse ndash are being kept by someone.ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking, you donrsquot know what to do, she says. ldquoIrsquove since heard of so many dog thefts or dogs going missing. The house isnrsquot the same without them here.Earlier this month, a three years old chocolate-coloured spaniel called Obie, which had been snatched from a property in Harburn, West Lothian, was reunited with owners after being found  miles away in Penrith.According to Charlene Gun, who runs Lost  Found Dogs West Lothian on Facebook, dog thefts are not re in the area, but there is cause for concern.ldquoAre profits increasing for people selling dogs  Yes. Are the chances of thefts quite high  Irsquod tell anyone to never trust anyone or take any chances, she says.ldquoAre certain breeds more desirable and more likely to be picked up  Yes.ldquoWhen you are in a situation where one litter of eight puppies can earn someone around pound,, then itrsquos better not to leave your dog unattended.If Google searches for puppies and dogs in the wake of March lockdown is anything to go by, there is no shortage of demand: searches for lsquobuy a puppyrsquo rose by %, with lsquoadopt a puppyrsquo rising by %.As well as raising fears over dog thefts, demand has led to concerns of a growth in puppy farms.Just last week more than  dogs and cats were seized from a suspected puppy farm in Perthshire, including three pregnant bitches and three litters of puppies.Animal welfare charity the Scottish SPCA says it launched  investigations into puppy farming in October alone, and fears demand for puppies over the festive period would lead to a rise in the number of cases.ldquoThe combination of coronavirus restrictions and extortionate prices of puppies is being manipulated by puppy traders selling badly bred dogs, said Scottish SPCA chief superintendent, Mike Flynn.ldquoThere are things we would urge any buyer to do, such as insist on seeing the pup they are buying at the sellerrsquos home or premises with their mum.ldquoWe know many dealers are telling unsuspecting members of the public to meet them in a car park or public space to pass over the dog safely.ldquoThe seller will often be wearing a mask and afterwards they are impossible to get a hold of when the pup gets sick.He added: ldquoPrices have skyrocketed in  as responsible breeders scaled back due to the restrictions, yet demand increased as many people were stuck at home.ldquoNow, dealers can charge more than ever before and sell more easily than theyrsquove previously been able to.ldquoThe root of this problem is public demand. As we approach Christmas, we are frightened by the prospect of the general public flocking to these people to buy sick and ill puppies.ldquoThe onus is on every single person in Scotland to put this despicable trade out of business."},{"url":null,"title":"lights-camera-action-scotland-remained-haven-filming-pandemic","story":"As an award-winning Location Manager for almost  years, shersquos scoured the country to find the perfect backdrop for movies ranging from Outlaw King to T Trainspotting, Fast  Furious  to Netflix comedy Eurovision, when she helped switch the SSE Hydro from Glasgow and plopped it in the heart of Edinburgh.While on television, shersquos found locations that have brought scripts to le, such as the stunning house on the edge of Loch Long which almost stole every scene in BBC Onersquos surrogacy thriller, The Nest.Having put the nationrsquos scenery on the screen, Dunn ndash whose role will be showcased in a short film which will open the BAFTA Scotland Awards on Tuesday ndash admits there are challenges in finding unspoiled spots that havenrsquot been used before and, crucially, arenrsquot already occupied by campervans and tents.ldquoItrsquos not always easy to find new places, says the Hamilton-based location expert. ldquoBut what is fascinating is no two scripts are alike.ldquoSo, although we might have been to a certain house or place, one production will be distinct from the other.However, she adds, ldquoa huge part of the location is dealing with the public.Such as on the Isle of Skye, where tourist numbers have shot through the roof meaning anyone trying to grab a perfect Instagram shot of the Fairy Pools, for example, will either have to rise at the crack of dawn or be content with having stray people photobomb their shot.That can be tricky for anyone trying to capture Scotlandrsquos wild beauty, never mind set up camp for a major production.ldquoSkye is an amazing island, adds Dunn. ldquoThe people are fantastic. But the problem in Skye is that we canrsquot find accommodation.She will reveal how she finds the perfect location in a short film to be screened prior to the live-stream of the British Academy Scotland Awards, the annual celebration of the nationrsquos film, games and television industry.EE Film Stories: BAFTA Scotland, will follow Oban-born Dunn, location scout Amelia Jacobsen, from Edinburgh, and location assistant Evie Harkins, from Glasgow, as they visit five locations and reveal how the latest network innovations enabled them to work through the pandemic.It will also show how behind the scenes professionals like Dunn are vital to bringing a script and directorrsquos vision to le.Dunnrsquos credits include T Trainspotting, Sky Atlantic drama Patrick Melrose, Outlaw King, Stag, World War Z, The Jacket and Doomsday. As well as searching out the best location, she handles necessary permits for filming, liaises with authorities over road closures, works with residents and businesses and troubleshoots problems.In the case of World War Z, it meant working around countless city shoppers and commuters as they transformed one of Glasgowrsquos busiest areas into Philadelphia.ldquoOne of the issues with World War Z was that people take a train every day into Glasgow ndash how could we noty them in advance that they just canrsquot walk straight across George Square , she recalls.ldquoSo, you have to get to know all the Glasgow streets in the area and tell people which roads they can go down instead.ldquoThen there are the tourists in Skye and Glencoe. Therersquos a lot of planning and we try to work as far in advance as possible.There have been times when shersquos had to approach campers who pitched up in a remote spot unaware that it was planned for a shoot the next day and advising them that they might want to move or risk finding themselves surrounded by  trucks and a film crew.Luckily, she has almost total recall for just about every part of Scotland, and an eye for knowing how subtle tricks might transform even unlikely spots to fit the script.Such as turning Glasgowrsquos Barras into a New York meat market complete with carcasses and piles to rubbish for Sky Atlantic drama, Patrick Melrose, starring Benedict Cumberbatch.While George Square became Philadelphia for World War Z, a road in Grangemouth doubled as a US highway, bringing locals in droves to spot Brad Pitt racing past the pipes and chimneys of the local oil refinery.For Netflixrsquos biopic about Robert the Bruce, Mugdock Country Park near Milngavie became the scene of the  Battle of Loudoun Hill.Shersquos currently working on finding suitable locations in Edinburgh for a film that will tell the story of how researcher Philippa Langley uncovered the final resting place of King Richard III underneath a Leicester car park.Starring Steve Coogan as Langleyrsquos husband, The Last King comes from the same award-winning team of Coogan, Stephen Frears and Jeff Pope who were behind rsquos Philomena, which landed four Oscar nominations.Despite the pressures placed on the most popular locations Dunn says there are still fantastic spots for professional and amateurs to explore in Scotland.Some are closer to home than we might think.ldquoI have huge fondness for Perth, it has lovely architecture, rivers, castles, I love it, she says. ldquoAnd during lockdown I discovered one of my favourites places was right at home in Hamilton.ldquoIrsquod never entered Chatelherault Country Park from Barncluith. It was like something out of The Hobbit.Dunn says technology has transformed her job from early days of trawling through maps and knocking on doors in the hope of finding the right spot.ldquo has been a tumultuous time for the industry and, of course, beyond. But I have been encouraged and inspired by the innovations that allow us to introduce colleagues from all over the world to the wonders of Scotland live and, in the moment, through the power of a G phone.ldquoItrsquos a long way from my first digital camera, that used a floppy disc for a memory card. I often couldnrsquot send photographs because there was no signal.ldquoI canrsquot imagine how we got things done before.The BAFTA Scotland Awards will take place on Tuesday  December and will be live-streamed from pm on BAFTArsquos Facebook and YouTube channels, followed by a highlights show on BBC Scotland at pmSeeking inspiration for your next film or photography project  Here are film location expert Lloret Dunnrsquos top places to explore.Perth: On the banks of the silvery Tay with streets lined with independent shops, an abundance of striking architecture and stunning autumnal colours. ldquoI love it, she says.The Bunnet Stane, Fe: A rock formation near Gateside in Fe, where a table of rock, around ten feet by  feet, is perched on a thin column of rock. ldquoItrsquos an incredible rocky outcrop that looks like an old back cap. Itrsquos almost prehistoric in its looks, says Dunn. Shersquos also a fan of Auchtermuchty.Auld Wersquos Lt, near Milngavie: Within the peat bog of Craigmaddie Muir are two huge boulders, with a third perched on top. ldquoThey look out over the hills, therersquos something primeval about them, says Dunn. ldquoThey are situated in a natural ampitheatre. I imagine the Picts gathering there, looking over the hills.Chatelherault Country Park, Hamilton: Close to Dunnrsquos home, the park has been well-explored. Enter via Barncluith to find a picturesque bridge and lush greenery.Loch Katrine: Dunn recommends visiting the opposite end from the visitorrsquos centre. ldquoTake a single track towards a lovely little peninsula to Rob Roy McGregorrsquos family graveyard. Itrsquos otherworldly.Easedale, Argyll: Dunn recommends Easedale, one of the Slate Islands, in the Firth of Lorn. ldquoItrsquos exceptional. There are beautul cottages and pools that are shiny blue.Skye: Dunnrsquos top spot is Duirinish, a peninsula between Loch Dunvegan and Loch Bracadale. Look for Dunvegan Castle and the distinctive peaks known as MacLeodrsquos Tables.Glasgow: Bridgeton has almost unique qualities, says Dunn. ldquoThe area has lots of red brick, it doesnrsquot feel like Scotland which is good when my job is trying to find places that we can make into somewhere . Glasgow overall gets a lsquothumbs uprsquo.Kyle of Lochalsh: Balmacara and, although a popular tourist spot, Eilean Donan Castle. ldquoI once worked on a commercial for William Lawson whisky, in which we hoisted a cannon over the wall.

In particular, the loss of real-time access to databases will add complexity, bureaucracy and delays ndash all of which our overstretched police officers cannot afford.ldquoIt will hamper their ability to identy, arrest and extradite foreign criminals.ldquoDespite repeated assurances from the Government, no new agreement with the EU on justice and security co-operation has yet been reached, with weeks now until the end of the transition period.They warned that it would be ldquodisastrous for policing and securityno deal was agreed, or a deal was reached which did not retain the UKrsquos access to key security databases used by the EU, adding:The Government must not place an ideological resistance to the Court of Justice of the European Union over the safety and security of the British people.A UK Government spokesman said safety of the country was \"our top priority and the UK will continue to be one of the safest countries in the world.\"He added: \"We are focused on reaching an agreement with the EU and there is a good degree of convergence in what the UK and EU are seeking to negotiate in terms of operational capabilities.\"In the event of a no-deal, he said there were \"well-developed and well-rehearsed plans in place.It comes as the Brexit talks continue between UK chief negotiator David Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier this weekend.Despite positive hints at a deal being struck during the week, on Thursday things turned sour when Downing Street sources said the EU had introduced additional demands at the eleventh hour.It has now emerged that France said it may veto any agreementa deal is reached, and No. confirmed the talks had reached a ldquovery dficult point. yesterday.Francersquos European affairs minister Clement Beaune said his country could use their vetothe terms of a deal on trade and security were not right.He said: ldquoI think itrsquos also the case for our partners thatthere were a deal that isnrsquot good, which in our evaluation doesnrsquot correspond to those interests, we will oppose it.ldquoI want to believe we will have a good deal, but to get a good deal you know itrsquos better to be frank, and to say our interests.

The inscription on her tombstone says ldquoLived once, buried twice, and itrsquos true. The first death was in  when she succumbed to a fever and was buried to prevent whatever she had spreading.She was interred wearing a valuable ring which her husband was unable to prise from her finger.This was a double incentive for body-snatchers who could get paid for body and ring. And they duly turned up after dark and began digging. However, they too couldnrsquot wrench the ring free so they decided to cut off the finger whereupon, as the kne went in, Margorie snapped out of her coma and woke up screaming.

She climbed out of the grave and made her way home.Her husband was in with the kids when he heard a knock on the door.He told them, sadly, that it was the same knock as their late motherrsquos.When John opened it and saw his we standing there in a burial shroud, blood dripping down from her finger, he promptly dropped dead on the ground.Margorie seems to have got over it quite quickly because she remarried and had more kids, and when her time came she went back to the same cemetery for the second time, hence the inscription which also carries the faint one of John.Down to a TA PRESENT to myself, the best kind, will be a T-shirt and a poster of Glasgowrsquos heroes and heroines ndash in the manner of Peter Blake and Sgt Pepper ndash by Renaissance keelie Stu Henderson, aka Stu Who .

He was amazed to receive a request from his record label, I think, that I write a dedication for a forthcoming one, or a commemoration of some sort.It wasnrsquot paid but even then I didnrsquot feel I could refuse, so I did.And I really hate the accordion because listening to it brings back memories of chapped knees and wet short trousers that rubbed welts into the thighs and being virtually force-fed tripe.I discover therersquos a Jimmy Shand website and from that the information that he had a Top  record in  with The Bluebell Polka and appeared on the BBC TV ldquoPop Music programme, which must have been some sight, him in his kilt and all. He was knighted in . But even more important is that several pubs, a diesel train and, what greater honour, a racehorse were all named after him.There is also a statue of him in his hometown of lsquoMuchty which, being clearly some kind of inspiring musical place, was also the home of the Reid brothers Craig and Charlie, aka The Proclaimers.I recently came across an electric ceilidh bandnamed as an homage, at least in part, to Shand called The Sensational Jimi Shandrix Experience.Itrsquos led by Sandy Brechin, who almost made the Eurovision final in  with the band Do Re Mi, featuring Kerry.

Those who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality so quickly, including volunteers for the testing programme, deserve our profound gratitude. “However, attentions must now turn to the practicalities of distributing the vaccine to all corners of the country in what will surely be one of the largest public health exercises in history. It is vital that our islands are not left behind and that appropriate steps are taken to guarantee equal access to the vaccine.“The Pfizer vaccine requires freezer storage and that presents practical dficulties in our island and rural communities.  I was therefore pleased that the Health Secretary was able to give me a categoric assurance that freezer storage will indeed be available in the islands and that priority groups in Orkney will form part of the initial roll out.“Further details about how this process will work in practice, including how any subsequent vaccines might be incorporated in the programme, are obviously needed.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects. I don’t really have the extra time it takes to do it.”She added: “If I can’t come out with a scheme then we don#t get anything is my understanding at the moment.“I know it is worth putting a bit of effort in, though, becauseit does work I can really make a dference to the shop and the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kate-forbes.jpg","title":"summit on future of gaelic as a community","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe summit on Tuesday st December, pm, will be co-chaired by Kate Forbes, constituency MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

There are still plenty of people in Skye and Raasay with Gaelic, and it can still be heard throughout the island.“Urgent work is required to save Gaelic, but as a living language it won’t be politicians, bureaucracy or tokenistic gestures that make the dference. Ultimately, it will be those people for whom it is the language of daily le that can reverse the decline.“I hope this summit will be a fruitful exercise in doing that.”Councillor Munro said: “It’s extremely important that Gaelic communities in Skye and Raasay have an opportunity to have their voices heard. The recent research by Soillse clearly sets out the challenges facing Gaelic in terms of usage and transmission.“Now is the time to consult with communities and to set the agenda for language policy and planning efforts.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year..

Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable.

The pupils will be taught online for the rest of the school term.Methody took the decision after  positive cases of coronavirus among sixth-form pupils this week.Unions, principals and many parents had been hoping the Christmas closure date would actually be brought forward to December  and have expressed dismay at the Minister#s reluctance to consider this.Earlier this week, leading principals told the Belfastthat an early closure was essential - on the basis that a child or teacher testing positive for Covid- will ruin Christmas for whole families.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseConcern: Justin McCamphill of the NASUWT FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueConcern: Justin McCamphill of the NASUWTMr McCamphill told the Belfastthat prevention is better than cure.We are disturbed that the Executive#s plan appears to be to close schools in January in the event that infections and hospital transmissions increase over the Christmas period, he said.The Executive needs to focus on ensuring that the R rate remains below  and should therefore follow the scientic advice which is most likely to achieve that outcome.Ministers must ensure that the decisions about the operation of schools over the Christmas period and the start of the new term do not undermine the safety and welfare of pupils and school staff.The NASUWT national official said there remains strong evidence of in-school virus transmission increasing which is only likely to be exacerbated by the inevitable rise in virus cases as a result of Christmas gatherings and relaxations around hospitality.Diane Dawson, Braniel Primary School principal, is against a new year closure.Whilst I have been adamant that schools should close by December  for staff and pupils, I#m not in favour of an extended closure in January, she said.We need the new school term to start as planned to allow our children to settle back into their routines, continue with their education and be with their friends.A delayed start to school le in January would not be advantageous to anyone.Ms Dawson said a problem with closure in January is that Year  pupils are due to sit AQE and GL transfer exams.She added: If we are to close at all - close school doors this side of Christmas to give us all the chance of a Christmas.A Department of Education spokesperson said: The Minister has consistently made the position on schools clear. Further unnecessary time away from the classroom will only cause greater disruption to children#s education and lead to an increase in levels of stress and anxiety. The Minister#s main priority is to guard children#s education, mental health and well-being.Schools should not change or extend their holidays or close early this term. Children should continue to attend school until the last day of term unless they have been told to self-isolate.

The hotel industry will reopen in a responsible manner with the health of guests and staff to the fore.Ms Gault expects all hotels to take advantage of the restrictions lting, but said until guidelines on how hoteliers should operate were released it could not be guaranteed that every hotel will reopen.However, some are expressing concern at the easing of restrictions, with one leading medic warning that we will face a banquet of consequences in the New Year following the Christmas season.Dr Tom Black, chairman of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, told the BBC that there will be an increase in transmission of the virus as families meet up over Christmas. If you want to ask a humourless doctor should we cancel Christmas and New Year, the answer from a purely healthcare point of view is yes. But we live in a democracy, we understand that people have their rights, he said.Dr Black added: To be clear, from December  until December  is  days. It is  days until January , when we will be sitting down to a banquet of consequences, with increased admission to hospital and more people in intensive care.To the public: do your best, keep your distance, wear your mask and wash your hands, and protect your granny please.He said he expected intensive care units to begin filling up with people in the third week of January.In the Republic, meanwhile, six more Covid--related deaths were recorded, taking the country#s overall tally to , since the pandemic started.Belfast Most ReadSinn Fein members quit the party amid allegations of homophobic and racist slursLords suspension of unionist peer Maginnis #smacks of disrespect#, says ex-UUP chairmanDirections #confused gran Mona Maye killed in wrong-way crash#, inquest findsThe £ Christmas dinner: Merchant Hotel tops price treePensioner caught putting condom on in front of woman in Belfast coffee shop jailed Latest NewsCovid cynic Jim Corr#s his own man, says AndreaMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases of Covid- in your council area Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Further seven deaths and  new cases ViewpointOpinionPoverty hell exacerbated by Covid-Ebay hand sanitisers found to contain less alcohol than claimed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In my view, the little magician was the greatest footballer the world has ever had the pleasure of watching. Its as simple as that. But, he was more than a footballer. He was an icon and it was fitting when the worlds greatest ever team, the New Zealand All-Blacks, recognised that. They carried out a black number ten jersey with his name emblazoned on it before last weekends meeting of the nations. Its just a pity Peter Shilton, a world-class goalkeeper in his own right, didnt have the same class. Yes, Maradona cheated with his hand of God goal against the England stopper. Some might say honesty is the best policy, but there is a time and a place to twist the dagger. And last week wasnt that time. googletag.cmd.push He may have had his problems off the pitch, but sporting stars should always be judged for what they do in the colosseums in which they perform. Maradona wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Of the nine mouths that needed fed in their home in the Villa Fiorito area of Buenos Aires, his father was the only earner, allowing his family to focus on study. It was Diegos ability to control the ball like it was an extension of his body that alerted the scouts of the local Argentinos Juniors. And so the roller-coaster was taking off. He bagged goal after goal and soon he was in the blue and gold of Boca Juniors. In their La Bombonera stadium, which shook with sheer atmosphere on game day, he led them to the Primera Divisioacuten. But, after just  games he was off to Europe as Barcelona came calling. googletag.cmd.push The fact that he moved to one of the Catalan giants, who were Mes Que Un Clubwas one thing. What defined him for me, was how he carried the national team. That wonder goal against England in  was a letime in the making. If you watch footage from his time at Napoli, that was the perfect grounding. Diego dragged an unfancied horse to two league titles, Italian and UEFA Cups, he was kicked black and blue. As he was in that  clash with England. Like the streets of Buenos Aires, Naples was the school of hard knocks. He literally had to dance his way around potential leg-breaking tackles and making a mockery of England was a by-product of it all.     Maradona is just one of those players that youd love to watch in the flesh. The viral video on social media of him juggling the ball is part of his legacy. He was just at one with the ball...oozing class. I remember trying to watch the  World Cup Final from a distance in the Bushtown Hotel. On the way home from the Port, we called in for grub. I pleaded to get away from the table. By that stage, the Germans had levelled the game at -. Maradona huffed and puffed all during the game, but he made the crucial play. His through ball played in Jorge Luis Burruchagafor the winner. Its that type of instinct that separates the good from the great. And the thing about it, much of that craft is self-taught away from the training field. I was chatting to Dermot Heaney during the week, for a feature in next weeks paper. His ball-winning ability was honed from endless hours kicking the ball against a gable wall. Unbelievable – like legend - is an overused word. It should only be used for occasions like last Sunday to describe Joe Cannings four sideline cuts over the bar. For all the great coaching hed had access to, Id say it was perfected on the family farm or at Portumna pitch. Eoin Bradleys goal in Derrys  qualier clash with Down. Owen Mulligans wonder goal against the Dubs the same year. All moments of magic. I remember chatting to a defender who had played against Glenullin one evening. How was he supposed to know what Skinner was going to do next, when the man didnt know himself. Thats the x-factor that makes all the dference. It was encouraging chatting to Damian Cassidy this week about the new proposals for Derrys coaching plan. In particular, it was the committees research around Go Games and making them five-a-side for the very young. Why  To promote decision-making and flair. Alleluia. This is what we have been missing. Back to the days of jumpers for goalposts and playing in the back field until either it got dark, or somebody huffed and went home with the ball. Once you realised that the big boys were going to kick you instead of the ball, it was time to figure out a wat to play around them. The great players learn on the job, away from regimented systems where they are forced to play with one hand tied behind your back. Thank God for Maradona. For those too young to remember him, the constant barrage of footage should inspire the next genius.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Glee star Damian McGinty is currently singing with globally successful group Celtic Thunder and lives in America with his we. And although he hasnt been back to Derry in a year due to the ongoing global pandemic, the city remains close to his heart and he is donating all the money from the sales of his popular calendar to St Vincent de Paul . The charity helps distressed people by visiting them in their homes and giving them money, clothing, food, fuel, furniture or electrical items. googletag.cmd.push Damian explained: Something that has been really on my mind recently, is families putting food on the table over Christmas. Covid has hurt millions, whether it be in terms of health, or financially. I think a really serious issue moving forward is going to be hunger, and it absolutely breaks my heart to think of parents lying awake at night worrying about feeding their kids the next day. It breaks my heart to think of kids going hungry, and Santa being something that is simply not on the cards. It’s not fair. As well as selling the calendar Damian asked his fans to donate what they could afford and has raised just under pound,. googletag.cmd.push This will go a long, long way, said Damian. We can make a families Christmas a little bit better, and that’s a light the world needs right now. I wanted to try and use my  to make a dference as it’s been a tough year for so many and my followers helped me do that and I want to say thanks, so, so much. Last week, Damian joined Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Brian Tierney, for hislatest of his Covid- video appeal. Ive been really concerned to see the number of Covid cases across Derry and Strabane in the last few months – its really worrying, and the threat hasnt gone away, he commented.     I havent been home since Christmas and for me thats been quite dficult because I have never gone that long without visiting home in my le, and I miss it a lot. I know the community back home is full of amazing people that care about each other so Im appealing to everyone to do what they can to get us back to where we were and where we will be again. Mayor Tierney said that Damian is one of many people making sacrices for the greater good. I was delighted thatDamianjoined me in this message and has shared his personal experience to show why its important that we all follow the guidelines in place. Hehasnt been able to come home and visit his family since last Christmas, which, naturally, is incredibly dficult. Its just one example of many people and businesses who are making sacrices to protect our community and keep everyone safe, so alongsideDamianI am asking that everyone makes those sacrices worthwhile by doing all they can to reduce our cases numbers and stop the spread of Covid-.

The pensioner fell in the Greenwalk area of Creggan on Friday evening. Local people and family members who came to her aid did not want to move her, so they tried to keep her warm and dry after calling for an ambulance. However, local independent councillor Gary Donnelly said it took two hours for ambulance to arrive. Cllr Donnelly described the scene as shocking. He added that residents in Greenwalk have been trying to get improved street lighting for years but without success. googletag.cmd.push The family of the local woman said she suffered a broken shoulder in the fall. After being contacted by the Derry News, a NIAS spokesperson apologised for how Fridays call-out had been handled. “We apologise for any distress or discomfort suffered as a result of her prolonged wait for an ambulance,” the spokesperson said. “NIAS seeks to provide the quickest possible response to meet the clinical needs of any patient who contacts us as a result of having suffered illness or injury. “However, regrettably some patients are currently waiting longer than we would wish due to the demand for our service and the impact of the Covid- pandemic on our staffing levels.” googletag.cmd.push The NIAS spokesperson said the call in relation to the Creggan incident was received at .pm on Friday. “Based on information passed to ambulance control, it was prioritised as a Category  call with a performance target of  minutes. “A crew did not arrive at this scene until : which was  minutes outside of the target response. “NIAS recognises the distress and discomfort a wait of over two hours for an ambulance is to an elderly patient who is lying in the cold and wet, or to those who are caring for her at that time. “The delay in this case was as a result of crews in the area responding to calls which were more pressing in terms of clinical need.     “NIAS regrets that the patient had to endure this delay and once again offers a sincere apology. “We would have liked to have provided a more immediate response, particular given the age of the patient and the conditions in which she had to wait.” The NIAS spokesperson said they receive more than  calls each day through the  system. “To enable us to target our resources to those whose clinical condition is most urgent, each call is triaged and categorised accordingly. “Against each of the categories is a performance target for response times which NIAS aims to deliver. “Category  calls are those calls which are immediately or potentially le-threatening and to which NIAS seeks to despatch an immediate response with an average performance target of  minutes.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Breandaacuten McNally, from Greenlough, died last week and many tributes have been paid to him since. Fr Seamus OConnell told mourners at St Oliver Plunketts Church that the -year-old was a proud Greenlough man. “Brendy was quiet, good mannered, good looking and liked fun,” he said. “Brendy was born in Greenlough, baptised in Greenlough, went to school in Greenlough and played football with Greenlough boys. “Were celebrating the funeral mass of a Greenlough man, where he was well-respected and had fun.” Local GAA club, St Oliver Plunketts GAC, led the tributes paid to a sorely missed club man. googletag.cmd.push “Brendy as we all knew him liked nothing more than lining out for the wee reds on a Sunday afternoon and was a regular on the scoresheet for our reserve team too,” they said. “His passion and infectious smile will be sorely missed but never forgotten by all involved with Greenlough GAC. “We would like to pass on our sincere condolences to the McNally and Downey family circles at this sad time.” The widespread nature of the tributes paid to Breandaacuten highlighted how many les he had touched throughout the world. Breandaacuten celebrating success with Wolfe Tones GAC, Melbourne. He spent time in both Australia and America, and local GAA clubs with whom he was involved posted messages of support for the family on social media. googletag.cmd.push St Pats Donegal GFC in Philadelphia said there was deep sadness within the community following news of his death. “It is with deep sadness that we learn of the passing of Breandaacuten McNally. Brendy had a great summer in Philadelphia in  and enjoyed some great times with the club,” they said. “We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and extended family and friends at this sad time.” Wolfe Tones GAC in Melbourne, where Breandaacuten starred for their football team in , also extended their condolences. “Everyone at Wolfe Tones has been saddened to learn of the passing of one of our former players, Breandaacuten McNally,” they said.     “Breandan played for the Wolfetones men’s team last year and was a huge part of the team and all their success throughout . “On behalf of everyone at Wolfe Tones GAC we would like to extend our deepest condolences to all of Breandans family and friends.” The McNally family business, B McNally  Sons Car Sales, are former sponsors of Watty Graham GAC, Glen, who also sympathised with the family. “Watty Grahams are saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Breandaacuten McNally, son of our former senior football team sponsor, Brendan,” they said. “Condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and the entire McNally family at this very sad time.” Everywhere he went, the young Greenlough man has touched lives, Fr OConnell told mourners at his funeral mass on Friday. After Breandaacuten travelled to America to receive treatment for his condition, he made such an impression on the hospital staff that they kept in touch. “The trip brought a host of new friends, real, caring people and was unbelievable the care that the family received and especially their son,” said Fr OConnell. “It was delightful, so delightful that the nurses and one of the surgeons kept in touch, so impressed were they by Brendy and his family, and his mother in particular.” Mourners heard how family was so important in Breandaacutens le. Fr OConnell also paid tribute to Breandaacutens familys devotion to him at his funeral mass last Friday, and described them as extraordinary. “All of them were in America at one time or another, supporting one another. Thats how the family became known. “As far as Im concerned, his family were pretty normal people. They did ordinary things and did them well, but truthfully, they had become extraordinary.” The night before his funeral, Breandaacutens sister Aoe appealed to friends and family to write down their memories of him along with any photos to be posted in a special memory box at the chapel. Fr OConnell ended his homily with a story that summed up the relationship between the McNally siblings. “Wed a concert one time in Greenlough. There were all kinds of people involved and Patsy was there with this wean on her knee,” he said. “Low and behold, when her brother appeared on stage, off she went like a scalded cat, leaving granny wondering where she was going. “Where did she go  She didnt settle until she got onto the stage and claimed her brother. Aoe was that wean. “She now claims him even more than ever. Family is important. Family is signicant,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deferral by Causeway Coast and Glens Councils planning committee is to allow an alternative application to progress to the same stage so a decision can be made. The controversial proposal would see a single storey McDonalds restaurant with car parking and drive through facilities erected at a section of the existing Asda site alongside the towns Ring Road. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

People Before Profit councillor Eamonn McCann was speaking after new documents revealed by the Derry News this week showed that there are currently no engineered controls preventing potentially dangerous substances at the Mobuoy site from leaking into the adjacent River Faughan. The River Faughan provides water to , local homes and businesses. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas issued a consultancy tender asking companies to put forward plans to clean up the Mobuoy site where an estimated .m cubic metres of waste is located. googletag.cmd.push The tender is worth up to pound.m. Cllr McCann said the Derry News had done the environment a favour in publishing the government documents dealing with the dangers emanating from the dump at Mobuoy Road. “The documents confirm in stark terms what many environmental and community groups have been arguing for years. – that the dump contains dangerous substances with a potential to pollute the Faughan river, which provides water to , premises in the Derry and Strabane area - and that current arrangements for containment are not adequate. “The Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairsis at least now admitting what the environmental network The Gathering has been insisting for years now – that the Mobuoy dump poses a threat to health and well-being in the North West and must be dealt with as a matter urgency.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr McCann said the information published in the Derry News this week was telling. “But there’s a lot more we need to be told,” he said. “The process of obtaining and evaluating bids for the consultancy business will take months. “This is what we have become used to in campaigning on the Mobuoy issue - delay, and then more delay.” Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said that this week she had submitted a number of questions to DAERA Minister Edwin Poots on the current situation at Mobuoy. One of the questions asked for the Ministers assessment of the risk to drinking water, river quality and wildle from the lack of ‘engineering controls’ at the Mobuoy waste dump.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bout was held in Haringey Arena before Spinks went on to claim Olympic gold and later the British featherweight title.Although he lost that particular bout to Spinks, he never lost his love of the noble sport over the next decades of his le and his contribution to sport was recognised by Nottingham City Council after  years of being involved with the youth of the community, presented with a Golden Jubilee Award by Broxtoe Borough Council.Described as one of Nottinghams most colourful and dedicated of men whose love of football and boxing had been passed on to eager rising stars.“I am sure there are far more deserving causes, but I am pleased to have been given an opportunity to pass on what knowledge I have to enthusiastic youngsters and to promote the good of young people who have a lot to offer.”At the age of , Jimmy was involved with the St. Eugenes Boys Club where he helped to run football and boxing teams.He then attached himself to the City of Derry ABC and such was his potential that in  he was persuaded to turn professional.In a distinguished boxing career as a flyweight, he had  contests,  of which he won. He drew four and lost eight, before retiring from the ring in .He then moved to Nottingham in  where he worked as a bookies runner, a builder, and a delivery driver before qualying as a youth leader with the National Association of Boys Club.From there he was invited to help run the Hilltop Catholic Church Youth Club and afterwards he went to Eastwood Youth Centre as an assistant leader.It was at the Eastwood Youth Centre where Jimmy encouraged an interest in boxing and as a result Eastwood Amateur Boxing Club was formed in the late s. googletag.cmd.push Reaching outSince his death, his grandson Wayne Barton has uncovered more of Jimmys le and as he himself discovers more about his grandad, he is eager to share and reach out to anyone who knew Jimmy from his days back in Derry.“Since he passed away, Ive retrieved all his sporting memories,” Wayne told the Derry News. “He was born in Derry and lived there before he came to Nottingham where he married by nan and they were together for  odd years.“The first thing I found was the report from the fight against Terry Spinks. Terry and my grandad both fought each other in Spinks first professional fight and through that Ive been finding other bits as well.“My grandad was a featherweight pro and as well as boxing he was heavily involved in football, both through a Catholic school in Derry.“He also started a football club over here, Priory Celtic FC, which has now got  teams from Us upwards. He opened his own boxing gym as well and trained quite a few boxers. He didnt really talk much. He enjoyed doing what he done, football ad training, but he wasnt one for bragging or talking about his le.”Wayne speaks with an enthusiasm that obviously runs in the family about his grandads love of sport and of giving back to his community. “Theres loads of information and Ive only just started finding them,” he explained.“I dont know a lot, Im still learning. Its shocking what you learn from something like this.“The last we heard he had a niece. His other family members have passed away but I dont knowtheres any more of his family over there so I thoughtthis was in the paper, and anyone did know, maybe they could pass it on or get in touch.“He used to donate his time to train pupils at the schools he worked for football and boxing, so anyone who was there in that time frame – I think he was in his s – they might remember him and anyone who knows him can maybe pay their respects to him.”     RecognitionJimmys selfless work unsurprisingly received citywide recognition and as he goes through the treasure of his grandads long and productive le, Wayne is moved by the number of lives that Jimmy Loughrey touched in many ways.“He eventually started getting Alzheimers so he had to stop work and stop training but the Nottingham City Council gave him an award for all the outstanding work that he did over on this side,” he continued.“As well as these newspaper clippings I have loads of old black and white photos here from boxing from Derry. There are also a few bits Im sending back to the Omagh Memorial Fund because he did a charity boxing match at the time. I have a video of the medals being passed around and I have an address so Im sending that back to Omagh where that belongs.”Wayne is hoping that by reaching out, he can learn even more about the man who achieved so kuch, on both sides of the water.“It would be nice to get in touch with other people who might have known him for periods as well so I can pass stuff on and put it where it belongs instead of just chucking it,” he said.“Its not only my grandads history, its everybody s history – there are hundreds of people who he has met.“All the photos that I have got of him, he was never one to be stood in front. He is either in the middle or toewards the back where you can still see him or at the sides. He was never up front apart from a couple of boxing ones. I have one of him from  of him and Terry Spinks“Its not a loss, he has done a lot and he has gained. This is to just let the people in Ireland know, where he is from, where he started his boxing, because there will be people out there who know him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is easy to imagine the frustration among the group at present.“Obviously with the way the season ended last year with us being relegated and it finishing early, we were just chomping at the bit to get going and get a good run at the league,” Burke said.“But it just keeps getting put back and put back and for players its as frustrating as hell. We did a six weeks pre-season and we thought it was going to start then, then it’s put back two weeks, and you go between being fit and being not fit.“We have a really good group, a very young group, but players who are willing to learn and willing to work. There are a good mixture of young players and older heads, but it hasn’t been too hard on team morale because we’re all looking forward to the season starting up.”A number of players have left Stute since they last played a league game back in February, but Burke stayed put, determined to right a few wrongs this season.“I probably could have gone where but when I spoke to Sean, I wanted to give it a proper crack this year,” he explained. “Last year I had so many injuries, I was out for eight to ten weeks with a hamstring and I couldn’t get going.“Being made captain was a big pull obviously because I’ve never captained a senior club before and it’s a big honour and big trust for Sean to put in me.“I don’t feel extra responsibility really but I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform. That’s the thing for me this year, to perform on the pitch. There are a lot of players in the team who are vocal and do all the talking but for me it’s just to set an example and perform.” googletag.cmd.push ProfessionalBurke takes issue with the refusal to class Championship clubs and players as non-elite, saying the decision makes no logical sense.“With our team having so many professional contacted players, Institute is run like a professional club, so there’s no half measures,” he continued.“It’s hard to see that, specially when you see even fans being able to go to those games. The way we’re training at the minute we’re not even allowed to touch footballs so it’s very, very frustrating but we’ll get there.“You see Derry City in the same city playing games, then you see Coleraine and they’re playing just up around the corner. What’s the dference  I’m sure the coronavirus doesn’t dferentiate, just because you’re seen as an elite player.”Stute are slowly but surely closing in on a full calendar year without kicking a ball in a league game, and Burke, like his team mates, is desperate to finally get back on the pitch.“Hopefully now on January , or even before that in the Northwest Cup we can play,” he said. “Obviously we would like to play couple of games before the season starts but the way things are going, you never know. We’re under no illusions that it’s going to be a hard year. There are a couple of teams that could go for the league, and with it only being  games you have to hit the ground running. We’ll give it a good go anyway. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To be honest, it’s depressing, especially the way the matches ended up. I always watch them but it was soul destroying at times. Watch LOI was something I suppose but the way it ended up it might have made people worse, because there was no heart in it this season. It was hard to watch.”Breaking from such a tradition has been a real wrench for Norman, and hundreds of other fans, and while WatchLOI has provided coverage of every game, it is still a world away from the real thing.“The game definitely isn’t the same,” he continued.“It’s always been Derry City, they are the only team I’ve ever followed. My da, me and my brother always stand together at the matches and we have done for years. He took us from ’ and it’s always been Derry. Eventhey weren’t winning, we still went, like a lot of people. They are just the heart of the town. Even the boys who don’t go they would still ask you how did the match go. You want to see them do well, but it just wasn’t there this season.“The matches were hard to watch as well, and it just got worse and worse. We were all on messenger watching it and we were all cracking up with each other. It was probably good for the them that people weren’t at the matches.”MissingBe it the smell of the chippy, the dodgy pre-match music, the roar of the crowd, calling the referee everything or losing yourself in a goal celebration, it has all been swept away.In its place is silence, and whilst the absence of fans has clearly affected the players, those same supporters are also dealing with a huge loss.“I want to go back,” Norman insisted. “I would go back todayI could. I would go stand there tonightI could, but the way things are now nobody knows what to do. Everyone in Brandywell Pride, our weekend was for the matches. I just worked until Friday and waited for Friday night, and that’s what I’ve done the last  years.“It’s been a strange season for everyone. We don’t know when we’ll get back either which is the scary thing about it.“Evenwe do, I don’t think it will be the same, with everyone squashed in. We would have stood in Block J for years, but it might not be the same for a long time. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played.

At the minute I am focusing on getting as fit as possible to make sure Irsquom able to do the best that I can in whatever I do.ldquoI want to be healthy and injury-free so I will make that decision closer to the time depending on how things are going.Going into last nightrsquos crunch tie, Northern Ireland were hoping to secure a play-off place in the European Championships for the first time.Despite her absence for the remainder of the campaign, Caragh says she has no doubts Northern Ireland can secure second position in Group C and make history.She credits manager Shiels with instilling a strong belief in his side. ldquoHe has brought out something that was always there but a lot of it is belief and confidence, she said.ldquoPreviously we would have played within ourselves to avoid defeat, but now there is an attitude that we can go and win this game.ldquoThere is a hunger and desire to push on.

Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm. It will be broadcast live on the RTE News Channel and also on the RTE Player International.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it. If anyone reading this has their whites from a bygone time hidden in an attic somewhere, why not retrieve them and dust them down for next spring If you played a bit at school and just feel like revisiting the sport for a bit of exercise and a bit of craic with new people, then please do it.Evenyoursquove never played, but have walked down the Strangford Road and loved that beautul setting, then it might be worth a go.We all need things to look forward to and we all need hope. Downpatrick Cricket Club needs that hope too.Maurice Irvine, a dear friend and colleague and master of cricket at Down High School, is also a former player for the school and the club.He strongly recommends anyone to take up the bat again or try it out whatever level you are at.When I asked him how he felt at the possible closure of Downpatrick Cricket Club, he said:ldquoIt is with great sadness that I learn of this possibility. I have many memories of playing there under the guidance of Roy Briggs, Ken McCammon and many others, developing my love of the game. ldquoCricket is a great game educating young people especially in respect, fair play, how to win and lose with dignity and team spirit.ldquoDownpatrick Cricket Club, along with Saintfield and Dundrum, is also a great place for Down High cricketers to gain valuable experience and the opportunity to learn from more experienced cricketers.ldquoDownpatrick have also been very generous to Down High, allowing us access to nets when they were not available at school and I would add my encouragement to anyone in the area to become involved to help the club at this dficult time.For me, the Linehan family are synonymous with cricket in Downpatrick.Alfie and Hugh will remain heroes of mine always, while current club chairman Paul Linehan hopes thatanyone can assist to keep the club going they will contact him on   or email paul.k.linehan@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Drumaness.jpg","title":"Drumaness green space plans  ","story":"A NEW amenity area is to be created in Drumaness by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.An area known locally as the lsquoBack Fieldrsquo where a play park was located a number of years ago is to be redeveloped.The news has been welcomed by Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, who is pleased that a raised area made of bricks and concrete is to be flattened and reseeded with GAA and football posts and nets to be provided.The local politician, who has been lobbying for the work to be carried out, said it is now possible as the village has two play parks, explaining that the remnants of bricks and concrete at the back field can now be removed, with this particular work long over due. ldquoThe area will be flattened and seeded so it can be safely used, with a set of GAA and soccer nets provided, said Cllr Mason.ldquoWe all know how vital it is to get outside into the fresh air, especially our children during these unprecedented times.

Progress is at last being made, but the money required to finance the scheme is the final piece in the development jigsaw, he said.ldquoThis scheme is good news for the people of Ballynahinch and the wider district and what everyone is keen to see is a timetable for delivery.Cllr Walker said the bypass had been talked about for  years and was now literally within touching distance.He added: ldquoWhat we require is a definitive timetable and confirmation from the roads minister that the money to build the new road is there. The scheme is finally moving in the right direction and now is the time to commit the money to ensure its delivery.Cllr Terry Andrews also welcomed progress in the bypass which he said can make a signicant dference for not only Ballynahinch, but the wider East and South Down areas.Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, said people in Ballynahinch look forward to the delivery of the scheme, urging consideration be given to farmers whose land has ben set aside for  years to accommodate the planned bypass.ldquoThese farmers have been unable to do anything with these areas of land which will probably be vested.

Please try again later.Submitting...In doing so this trend perpetuates a trend of ignoring such voices going back to , and this newspaper’s Stop the Legacy Scandal essays.The series was open to anyone who thought legacy was being handled in such an unbalanced way as to be a scandal. Beyond that contributors wrote what they wanted and there was a wide range of essays.We ran articles from an ‘official’ republican Padraig Yeates, from the ex IRA man Shane Paul O’Doherty, from the churchmen Canon Ian Ellis and Rev Alan Irwin, from ex security force personnel such as Alan McQuillan and Col Tim CollinsThere were essays from victims campaigners such as Kenny Donaldson, from politicians such as Doug Beattie and Jim Allister, from commentators such as Kevin Myers and Ruth Dudley Edwards.We ran essays from victims such as Anne Grahamand Jackie Nicholland Anthony O’Reilly .There were essays from the lawyers including the barrister Austen Morgan and the solicitor Neil Faris and academics such as Liam Kennedy and Henry Patterson. The legacy scandal series did not take a position on the  Stormont House proposed legacy structures, but anyone who read all the essays would agree that that plan took a battering. Many writers thought Stormont House would not resolve the advantage the IRA has on legacy, and might even worsen it.Yet since that series such scepticism has continued to be largely ignored. There have been many legacy discussions on radio or TV which only included supporters of Stormont House.By far the largest number of Troubles victims were murdered by republicans . Some victims of such terror back Stormont House, but increasing numbers of them do not.So when you hear a legacy broadcast that includes an IRA victim alongside republicans and others, it might seem balanced but it isn’tthe victim is pro Stormont House. If so, then it is a discussion among people who agree.The Archbishop of Canterbury has presided over talks that does not include those who believe legacy is demonising state forces who prevented civil war.Six elderly soldiers are proceeding to homicide trials for single shooting incidents half a century ago while no IRA leader who orchestrated decades of murder is.Every time an imbalance in these prosecutions is alleged a host of voices emerge to ‘prove’ not The legacy scandal is far greater than soldier prosecutions, but the veteran element to legacy is at least easy to understand. Did Most Rev Justin Welby not pause to askany IRA leader faces trial  Why terror godfathers such as Brian Keenan, Kevin McKenna, Billy McKee, Martin McGuinness never served time commensurate with their boodshed. They were allowed to come off violence, after decades of it, at a time of their choosing, then to live out their days with no fear of arrest.Did Archbishop Welby not wonder why the former victim commissioner Judith Thompson lost the faith of many victims  Did it not occur to him to research the dference in outlook between victims groups such as WAVE and Kenny Donaldson of the large Innocent Victims United umbrella group, the latter of which has persistently protested that legacy is being soft on terrorists Did it not occur to him that retired police, representing ex RUC, were not present in his talks, but army concerns were present, and this might be because army have greater clout  .Did it occur to him that people in his talks might be trying to depict IRA and state forces as equally culpable for the past violence  Because such voices are widespread.If anyone is still trying to understand what is happening on legacy, then here is a simple way to explain it: Republicans and their growing army of apologists are not remotely scared of legacy. They know the UK has not the heart even to contradict their lies, let alone chase them through the courts in the way republicans are being allowed to chase the state.Archbishop Welby has bedn played for a fool. But it is a deep betrayal of the UK government to let the Northern Ireland Office be in these secret talks, along with the organisation to which the NIO typically defers, Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs. Radio Ulster this week let that perpetual scold of the UK, Ireland’s foreign minister Simon Coveney, sermonise atand with minimal contradiction on the need for yet more scrutiny of the appalling murder of Pat Finucane. No wonder Dublin feels free to hector London on legacy. The latter has said nothing as Ireland has humiliated the UK before the Council of Europe for not doing enough on legacy cases that the IRA holds dear. A contemptible failure of Stormont House was that it did not seek to investigate Ireland’s security failures, including decades of extradition refusals so that fanatical IRA killers were able to base themselves there .When the UK naively signed the  Anglo Irish Agreement they thought this would improve. It didn’t.Earlier this year London realised its blunder at Stormont House. But I never believed there was much to its retreat. All they want is to keep down costs and avoid soldier prosecutions. The reported presence of the MoD, but no RUC representatives, is proof of that .Evenan amnesty leads to an end to prosecutions, the republican goal is clear: demonise the state through sub criminal investigations.They are happythey get endless inquiries that are decided on a civil standard of balance of probabilities, not a criminal one of beyond all reasonable doubt. It is why they pushed for a Finucane inquiry to add to the legacy inquests, which have become mini inquiries into allegations against the state.Peter Robinson in his News Letter column on Friday  wrote powerfully on what a grievous injustice it would be to spend yet millions more on this one Troubles killing.But he ended on a troubling note calling for “an agreed victim-centred framework for investigations”.That sounds good but the DUP under him agreed Stormont House. It prompts the question. What is the position of the DUP on these talks  It is astonishing the party was not given even a hint of them. So now, given what we know about the imbalance in participants and the complete exclusion of sceptics, the party could be clear and state that it will treat any recommendations from this process with the contempt they deserve.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: There is a grave imbalance in the number of soldier Troubles legacy prosecutions• Peter Robinson: To hold an inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane while ignoring thousands of others would be an outrage——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

holding a published book in your hands that you have written is the best feeling.ldquoItrsquos great.Mrs Danter drew inspiration from a childrenrsquos book which she personally found horrying.ldquoI saw a childrens book called Dex and the Funfair by Paul Shipton.ldquoIn my opinion the story is shocking.ldquoEvenI wasnt part of the funfair industry myself, I wouldnt want my children to read such a book.ldquoThe worst part about this, is the book is fact that it is in some school libraries.The book details Dex smashing up a tin can alley stall and the stallholder giving Dex a prize to make him leave.ldquoThis is shocking on all levels, she said. ldquoAllowing children to read books like this at the age of five or six cannot be a good thing.ldquoMy second inspiration came when my nephew came on holiday with while we were on our travels, which in turn reminded me just how much fun it was growing up on the fairground.ldquoI decided to write Nelsons Funfair Holiday - a story about a little boy who goes to stay with his auntie who owns a funfair.ldquoThis story will give children a glimpse of what it is like visiting and growing up on the fairground.ldquoChildren in my opinion must have all the experiences le has to offer to broaden their minds ready for the wider world.ldquoTravelling fairgrounds are part of our heritage in the UK and across Europe.ldquoItrsquos our history, its who we are and we are all play a part in that, whether you grow up on the fairground or not.The Danters originally hail from Brynmawr.Goff Danter, an artist, was able to offer India tips and advice on illustrating the book which is her first having previously been commissioned to do pencil drawings under the trade name Romayne Art.Mrs Danter also has another book under her belt.Entitled Me and My Social Media, itrsquos a short, gripping story about the dark side of social media and how a perfectly normal family can be turned upside down.ldquoI am very proud of this book, she added. ldquoEverybody who reads it tells me they cannot put it until they have finished it.Nelsons Funfair Holiday costs pound. and is available from Amazon and Waterstones. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These centres have already been decided by health boards and are in the process of being prepared.The development process for coronavirus vaccines has been as stringent as any other but the process in the face of the pandemic has been sped up by prompt, world-wide funding and a reduction in paperwork.Theof the trials have not been shortened, and the usual safety measures remain in place.The vaccine will not be mandatory and people will be able to choose whether they take up the vaccine or not.Information will be provided to people before vaccination to reassure them about patient safety and robust consent processes will be in place.Vice-chairman of the Covid- Vaccine Programme Board, Richard Roberts from Public Health Wales, said: ldquoIt is a signicant achievement that only  months after WHOannounced the global pandemic that we now have the first safe and effective vaccine available for use in Wales, and other vaccines to follow.\"Everyone has been preparing for months to deliver the Covid- vaccine programme, and it is very exciting that we will be able to begin, once the final steps have been put in place so that the programme can be delivered safely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fafafed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abbcfdaccfffadca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
