So is it now safe to view art – and how will they cope with the drastic drop in numbers? ‘There was a moment,” says Andrew Nairne, “when I was thinking, of course, we are like Nottingham Contemporary and the Hepworth Wakefield, places like that.” The director of Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge is guiding me around a gallery that’s “in rehearsals” for a socially distanced opening in August. “Then I remembered that the others don’t have a little cottage with tiny rooms and narrow corridors.”Today, the National Gallery in London is reopening after Covid-19 abruptly shut the doors of British museums in mid-March. But Kettle’s Yard, like many others, is taking a slower, phased approach. The institution regularly hosts shows in its new, airy galleries – an exhibition from the artist Linder will be extended into the autumn – but at its heart is the home of its founder, curator and collector Jim Ede. This takes the form of a series of knocked-through cottages, their awkward-shaped rooms brimming with art and delicate objects. It is meant to be a warm, hospitable place where visitors are allowed the freedom to sit in armchairs, leaf through books left out on tables, and generally feel at home. All of which also makes it a social-distancing nightmare.Visitors have long had to book for a tour round the Edes’ house. They still will, but a maximum of 18, rather than 72, will be able to come each day. Hand sanitisers will be much in evidence, and visor-clad staff will figure out how to steer guests so they clash with neither each other, nor the precious objects. Ventilation has been fiercely debated.“I said, ‘For heaven’s sake, can’t we just fling open some windows?” Nairne says. The answer was: “On no account.” The gorgeous Alfred Wallis paintings require proper climate control, although the air flow in the cottage has been deemed safe. The cafe, which normally occupies a tiny footprint into which tables are ingeniously crammed, will offer takeaways so that visitors can eat in the garden.Similar dilemmas are being confronted by museums across the UK. Those in England and Northern Ireland, bar locked-down Leicester, have been allowed to reopen since last weekend Scotland and Wales expect the green light later this month. “We want the experience to feel safe, but also inviting, so that people aren’t scared,” says Alfredo Cramerotti, director of Mostyn gallery in Llandudno, who hopes to begin a phased reopening at the end of this month. They will be asking people to wear masks inside the gallery. “It’s better not to pretend everything’s normal,” he says. “It’s not.”When I paid an early visit at the weekend, the National Gallery was looking cleaner and fresher than I’ve ever known it. A choice of one-way routes is now prescribed, and booking a time slot is mandatory (though still, of course, free). Being able to see art in a museum again, after nearly four months, was joyful. Those able to visit will have a memorable experience – without the usual crowds. “Normally,” says director Gabriele Finaldi, “we expect around 15,000 visitors a day. Early on, we expect between a fifth and a quarter of that.”But months of total closure, followed by radically reduced visitor numbers for the foreseeable future, is a financial disaster. This is equally true for museums that charge for entrance and for those that are free but rely on visitors spending money in shops and restaurants, and buying tickets for one-off shows. Finaldi tells me he is looking at the loss of £8-12m on a turnover of £48m. He has cancelled an exhibition of Dutch paintings, and delayed a Raphael show from 2021 to 2022.“We are a high-volume, low-margin operation,” he says. “During the period of lockdown, we would have had around 100,000 people through the door, each with a spend of around £20.” It is also a strongly seasonal attraction, with the bulk of visitors coming in the summer. Not this year. “It’s like three winters in a row.”The price, for some, of reopening to very few visitors is deemed too high just now. For museums run by local councils, taking staff off furlough, or deploying workers back into museums from other services, may require tricky calculations about relative social value. The Royal Albert Memorial Museum is run and largely funded by Exeter city council. “Reopening,” said a spokesman, “has to balance the value of the museum to the social, economic and cultural life of the city against the need to preserve the council’s scarce financial resources.”In other words, the money is needed elsewhere no reopening date has been set. You might think that being closed anyway for a new project – as is the case with Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery – would be serendipitous. But a complete stop, followed by socially distanced work, means a delayed project, which means costs. “At the moment,” says Fiona Bradley, its director, “I feel quite far away from people’s agonies about hand-sanitiser and one-way systems.” The revamped gallery was supposed to open in August. The date now given is February. “Covid-19 has cost us half a million pounds,” says Bradley.“We desperately need donations, help from our patrons and member and some kind of bailout,” says director Andrew Mackay. “Otherwise, I don’t see us surviving.” All the museum directors I speak to say the same: donations from supporters and visitors are more needed than ever.There will be sacrifices when visits become so highly controlled, often through bookable time slots. Finaldi says he will miss the casual commuter or passerby popping into the National Gallery for a few moments before catching a train from nearby Charing Cross station. “We have a learning space usually open 361 days a year, with lots of craft and making activities,” says Beth Bate, director of Dundee Contemporary Arts (DCA). Usually families can just wander in. Now there will have to be a booking system. “We will lose something from that,” she says.All the museum directors, large and small, say that reopening safely and rescheduling exhibitions is actually the easy part. The difficulties will come in a year or two. Those most dependent on international tourism do not expect visitor numbers to recover for some time. There will be no V-shaped recovery here. Budgets will be tighter. “Blockbusters will be fewer and further between,” says Finaldi.The emergency package will provide no silver bullet, and all eyes will be on the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s autumn statement. Everyone is thinking about how to work differently, how to make more money, how to spend less. “It’s a great moment to really use our collections, to share them with our near neighbours,” says Simon Wallis, director of the Hepworth Wakefield, who plans to reopen on 1 August, which is Yorkshire Day. “We can save money by not lugging art from all corners of the world – the insurance costs for doing so in recent years have been eye-watering.” Not to mention, he adds, the costs to the planet.Bate, meanwhile, is thinking about how DCA can work even more closely with her local authority in Dundee, on such issues as community cohesion, health and wellbeing. Amid all the crushing uncertainty there is still a sense of defiance and hope. “I’ve never seen people do so much with so little,” says Wallis. “We will come up with imaginative solutions. If we in the arts are not going to, who is?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b94253b2bbd32162f1373999efa23da6e8ba8e9/0_0_2500_2358/master/2500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f0db4ab8d3f3124382334eb97d677818 960w","title":"lifting of lockdown in england how do you feel reopening has gone","story":"We would like to hear from business owners and people who have visited pubs and restaurants to tell us how reopening has been Pubs, restaurants and hairdressers in England are some of the businesses that  were able to reopen from 4 July.

Jobs will go at all at JLR’s major factories, including Castle Bromwich, Solihull, Ellesmere Port and Halewood.The news come just weeks after Tata-owned JLR, Britain’s biggest automotive company, announced it would cut 1,100 agency jobs, after losing £500m in three months as the pandemic halted production and closed car showrooms.Last month, industry body the SMMT warned that up to one in six UK automotive jobs were at risk without a dedicated government support package.DHL said: “In light of highly challenging trading conditions in the global automotive sector and the unprecedented impact of the coronavirus pandemic, we have made the difficult decision to restructure our linefeed and freight operations supporting the Jaguar Land Rover contract.“We are now in consultation with our employees and their representatives and will make every effort to redeploy as many colleagues as possible to our other operations nationwide.”Draper said the union was awaiting details of proposed efficiency savings but warned that DHL should not “force staff to undertake impossible workloads as they show other workers the door”. It called on JLR to step in.He added: “While DHL is the employer, the reality is that the workers perform their roles for JLR. JLR has a moral duty to ensure that workers are treated fairly and decently during this incredibly difficult and stressful time.”A JLR spokesman said: “DHL informed us that they were going into consultation with some of their workforce last month.“Through its ongoing transformation programme and against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, Jaguar Land Rover is taking action to optimise performance and achieve further operational efficiencies to enable sustainable growth and safeguard the long-term success of our business.”JLR had already been grappling with major problems in the years before the pandemic, including sales ing in China in 2018-19 and demand falling in the UK through what it described as the “headwinds” of Brexit and consumers avoiding new diesel vehicles.The latest UK automotive manufacturing job losses follow cuts at Aston Martin, Bentley and Nissan since the pandemic started.

These roles are lost as firms come to rely increasingly on computer systems to perform administrative functions, leaving jobs growth confined to professional and low-skilled operations.“These results point to the possibility that the Covid-19 shock will reinforce the existing trend of employment polarisation.”Stefano Scarpetta, the director for employment, labour and social affairs at the OECD, said he was especially concerned that a generation of young people would be denied employment or retraining, restricting their ability to gain a sustainable, skilled job.“In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, governments acted far too late to address the labour market difficulties of youth, which left them with long-lasting scars that were still visible before the Covid-19 outbreak,” he said.“There is no time to waste to put in place a comprehensive policy package ensuring that no young worker is left behind.”The OECD also had a warning for all governments over the coming months, saying they must guard against a slap-dash approach to Covid-19 safety standards to protect the half of workers who will come into close contact with colleagues and customers as part of their job.Fearing a second wave of the pandemic in the autumn, it said ministers should also extend sick leave to allow staff to self-isolate if they discover they have coronavirus symptoms.The OECD said: “About half of all workers are employed in a job that requires significant physical interactions and therefore face a risk of contagion. Strong occupational safety and health standards, defined and enforced by public authorities andor by social partners, remain a top priority.“Paid sick leave can continue to perform an important role in containing and mitigating the spread of the virus and protecting the incomes, jobs and health of sick workers and their families. Moving forward, countries should consider closing long-known gaps in paid sick-leave regulations while reinforcing work incentives and employment support to facilitate a return to work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56775a0c63a2c7175f89f3b65e535b064afb6dbd/519_448_3498_2099/master/3498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f94ad97327c26da3661939ec9cd951d9","title":"boohoo to launch independent review of supply chain","story":"Move follows allegations about pay and conditions at Leicester factories selling clothes to firmThe online fashion retailer Boohoo has announced it will launch an independent review of its UK supply chain after recent allegations that some factories in Leicester that sell clothes to Boohoo paid workers below the minimum wage and failed to protect them from coronavirus.Boohoo, which owns brands including Pretty Little Thing and Nasty Gal, said the review will be led by Alison Levitt QC, and said it would initially invest £10m towards “eradicating malpractice” in its supply chain.The company said in a statement that the board was “shocked and appalled by the recent allegations” and was committed to working to rebuild the reputation of textile manufacturing in Leicester.The Boohoo group chief executive, John Lyttle, said the board is taking the matters seriously, adding: “We will not hesitate to terminate any relationships where noncompliance with our code of conduct is found.”The company will provide an update from its supply chain review in September, when it publishes its half-year results, with further updates due in January 2021.The group will also launch an independent third-party supply chain review, to be carried out by the ethical audit and compliance specialists Verisio and Bureau Veritas.The announcement of a review comes after retailers including Next, Asos and Amazon removed all Boohoo clothing from sale, and investors sold off the company’s shares, leading to £1.5bn being wiped off the brand’s market value in two days.Boohoo said it began to investigate allegations of worker mistreatment as soon as it was made aware of them.It said that to date it had not found any evidence of suppliers paying workers £3.50 a hour, or less than minimum wage, which is currently £8.72 for those aged 25 and over.However, the company said it had found evidence that two of its suppliers had failed to comply with its code of conduct and it has terminated its relationships with both of those firms.Boohoo had previously strongly denied any responsibility for the alleged bad practices of its Leicester suppliers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84b6de5077e82cac8a75ef55d96b7e8e8b1979b/0_116_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ffef3e65bc1f5c604819841fbd545f5","title":"markets investors ftse covid 19 lockdown us australia business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsGold did get hammered during the market meltdown in March - as panicking investors were forced to liquidate some assets to cover losses.The steady surge in the gold price shows that investors are worried that more lockdown measures may be imposed, to combat spikes in Covid-19 infections.As Paul R.

Some investors may be hedging their bets. There’s still a lot of skepticism that belies the fragile recovery.Buying gold could be a good hedge against a potential stock market pullback if the rebound in earnings and the economy doesn’t materialize in 2021 as expected. Boom! Gold has hit an eight-year high as investors try to protect themselves from a market downturn or a spike in inflation.Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades,says gold is in demand in case equities drop back towards the lows seen in March.It is worth pointing out that in March there wasn’t an immediate panic selling of gold but in the very short-term bullion was sold as investors were looking for easy cash in order to avoid margin calls from other losing positions.This could happen again temporarily if there was a violent correction on indices but the long-term direction is clearly positive.Gold’s traditional status as a safe haven against market turbulence, or currency devaluation, is also coming into play. Some goldbugs argue that precious metals are a safe investment, as governments may be forced to inflate away the huge debts built up under the Covid-19 pandemic.France’s statistics body has struck an upbeat tone this morning, predicting that the French economy will rebound strongly in the next few months.Neil Wilson of Markets points out that policymakers and investors are struggling to analyse the economic data:A huge part of the problem facing investors in this market is figuring out what the data is telling us.

In America, its the largest school bus operator and also runs Greyhound buses.Travel volumes have “reduced very substantially” since the crisis started, it says. And while governments and customers are providing support, First Group has made a loss of nearly £300m in the year to March 2020, compared to a £97.9m loss the previous year.The company isn’t releasing any forecasts for the current year, saying:There are material uncertainties as to how rapidly demand will increase, the rate at which fiscal support tapers and the duration of social distancing rules, as well as the timing of North American schools reopening. Therefore it is currently not possible to provide guidance for the financial year to 31 March 2021.First Group adds that it has “adequate resources” to keep operating for the next year, but its long-term future depends on several factors - including whether passenger numbers recover and whether governments keep providing support.The top fallers in London this morning are all companies who would suffer from a second wave of Covid-19 lockdowns.Energy firms and banks are leading the fallers across Europe this morning, followed by consumer and industrial stocks.That’s a sign that surging coronavirus infections are dampening the prospect of a swift economic recovery.

But the fact that investors are finally acknowledging this fact is more due to the overbought nature of the short-term market, and not a structural turn in sentiment.That will likely require an escalation in lockdowns across the US Sun Belt states. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Anxiety over the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is weighing on the markets today as some US states are forced to roll back their efforts to reopen their economies.With cases rising in around 40 US states, central bankers are now worried that the recovery is faltering as some bars, cinemas, restaurants and gyms are forced to shut again.Overnight, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester warned that more help will be needed to protect economies from the downturn, telling CNBC that:“We saw a reopening in May and activity starting to come back pretty well.Over the past week or so, there’s been some leveling off, and I think it’s probably due to the increase in cases not only in Ohio but across the country.”With the global case load nearing 12 million worldwide (including Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro), the pandemic’s grip on the world economy is tightening. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says:New daily US coronavirus cases dipped slightly at the start of the week. However, Tuesday’s figures have shown its premature to say that numbers are falling. COVID-19 concerns were further fuelled by warnings from several Federal Reserve officials that rising coronavirus numbers in the US could jeopardize the economic recovery. The timing here of the rising numbers in the sunbelt is extremely important given that some stimulus programmes are due to expire soon.The City will look to Westminster at lunchtime as chancellor Rishi Sunak announces a new swathe of measures to support the economy.We’re expecting a £2bn temporary job creation scheme to encourage workers to hire young staff, a stamp duty holiday, a £3bn green investment drive, and perhaps a temporary cut to VAT."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68d4c3677e44da43caefdd096ccdab2e975c34b/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61ae9fe72e422a8216a1dcab0ccf2266","title":"the future of food inside the worlds largest urban farm built on a rooftop","story":"In Paris, urban farmers are trying a soil-free approach to agriculture that uses less space and fewer resources. Could it help cities face the threats to our food supplies?On top of a striking new exhibition hall in the southern 15th arrondissement of Paris, the world’s largest urban rooftop farm has started to bear fruit. Strawberries, to be precise: small, intensely flavoured and resplendently red.They sprout abundantly from cream-coloured plastic columns. Pluck one out to peer inside and you see the columns are completely hollow, the roots of dozens of strawberry plants dangling into thin air.From identical vertical columns nearby burst row upon row of lettuces near those are aromatic basil, sage and peppermint. Opposite, in narrow, horizontal trays packed not with soil but coco coir (coconut fibre), grow heirloom and cherry tomatoes, shiny aubergines and brightly coloured chards.“It is,” says Pascal Hardy, surveying his domain, “a clean, productive and sustainable model of agriculture that can in time make a real contribution to the resilience – social, economic and also environmental – of the kind of big cities where most of humanity now lives. And look: it really works.”Hardy, an engineer and sustainable development consultant, began experimenting with vertical farming and aeroponic growing towers – as those soil-free plastic columns are known – on his Paris apartment block roof five years ago.This space is somewhat bigger: 14,000 sq metres, the size (almost exactly) of two football pitches. Coronavirus delayed its opening by a couple of months, but Nature Urbaine, as the operation is called, is now up and running, and has planted roughly a third of the available space.Already, the team of young urban farmers who tend it have picked, in one day, 3,000 lettuces and 150 punnets of strawberries. When the remaining two-thirds of the vast rooftop of Paris Expo’s Pavillon 6 are in production, 20 staff will harvest up to 1,000kg of perhaps 35 different varieties of fruit and vegetables, every day.Nature Urbaine is already supplying local residents, who can order fruit and veg boxes online a clutch of nearby hotels a private catering firm that operates 30 company canteens in and around Paris and an airy bar and restaurant, Le Perchoir, which occupies one extremity of the Pavillon 6 rooftop.Perhaps most significantly, however, this is a real-life showcase for the work of Hardy’s flourishing urban agriculture consultancy, Agripolis, which is currently fielding inquiries from around the world – including in the UK, the US and Germany – to design, build and equip a new breed of soil-free inner-city farm.“The method’s advantages are many,” he says. “First, I don’t know about you, but I don’t much like the fact that most of the fruit and vegetables we eat have been treated with something like 17 different pesticides, or that the intensive farming techniques that produced them are such huge generators of greenhouse gases.Produce grown using this soil-free method, on the other hand – which relies solely on a small quantity of water, enriched with organic nutrients, minerals and bacteria, pumped around a closed circuit of pipes, towers and trays – is “produced up here, and sold locally, just down there. It barely travels at all,” Hardy says.“It uses less space. An ordinary intensive farm can grow nine salads per square metre of soil I can grow 50 in a single tower. You can select crop varieties for their flavour, not their resistance to the transport and storage chain, and you can pick them when they’re really at their best, and not before.”Urban farming is not, of course, a new phenomenon. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, aims eventually to have at least 100 hectares of rooftops, walls and facades covered with greenery – including 30 hectares producing fruit and vegetables. A programme called Les Parisculteurs invites local groups to come up with suitable projects for up to a dozen new sites every year.Inner-city agriculture is booming from Shanghai to Detroit and Tokyo to Bangkok. Strawberries are being grown in disused shipping containers mushrooms in underground carparks. Not all techniques, however, are environmentally friendly: ultra-intensive, 10-storey indoor farms that have sprung up in the US rely on banks of LED lighting and are major consumers of energy, Hardy says.Aeroponic farming, he says, is “virtuous”. The equipment weighs little, can be installed on almost any flat surface, and is cheap to buy: roughly €100 to €150 per sq metre. It is cheap to run, too, consuming a tiny fraction of the electricity used by some techniques.Produce grown this way typically sells at prices that, while generally higher than those of classic intensive agriculture, are lower than soil-based organic growers. In Paris, Nature Urbaine should break even, Hardy estimates, some time next year – a few months later than planned because of the pandemic.There are limits to what farmers can grow this way, of course, and much of the produce is suited to the summer months. “Root vegetables we cannot do, at least not yet,” he says. “Radishes are OK, but carrots, potatoes, that kind of thing – the roots are simply too long. Fruit trees are obviously not an option. And beans tend to take up a lot of space for not much return.”But Agripolis runs a smaller test farm, on top of a gym and swimming pool complex in the 11th arrondissement, where it experiments with new varieties and trials new techniques. A couple of promising varieties of raspberries are soon to make the transition to commercial production.Urban agriculture is not the only development changing the face of farming. As with almost every other sector of the economy, digitisation and new technologies are transforming the way we grow food.Artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things are beginning to revolutionise farming, from driverless, fully automated farm machinery that can sow seeds and fertilise and water soil with maximum precision to systems that monitor exactly how healthy inidual animals are and how much they are producing (a concept known as the “connected cow”).Other AI systems analyse satellite and remote ground sensor data, for example, to monitor plant health, soil condition, temperature and humidity and even to spot potential crop diseases. The technique could help build plant and animal resistance to disease, and reduce waste. For example, with methane known to be a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, research is under way into the stomach bacteria of cows in the hope that tweaking animals’ gut microbes may eventually allow them to produce not just more meat, but also less gas.Urban farming of the kind being practised in Paris is one part of a bigger and fast-changing picture. “Here, we’re really talking about about building resilience, on several levels – a word whose meaning I have come to understand personally,” says Hardy, pointing to the wheelchair he has been forced to use since being injured by a falling tree.“That resilience can be economic: urban farming, hyper-local food production, can plainly provide a measure of relief in an economic crisis. But it is also environmental: boosting the amount of vegetation in our cities will help combat some of the effects of global heating, particularly urban ‘heat islands’.”Done respectfully, and over time, inner-city agriculture can prompt us to think differently both about cities, by breaking down their traditional geography of different zones for working, living and playing, and about agriculture, by bringing food production closer into our lives. “It’s changing paradigms,” says Hardy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07777a22be399ed742225036468bdc8059d3c01d/0_58_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bfd042f4bc9e98eac5a80db701d4963","title":"rishi sunak mini budget leftwing labour coronavirus public spending state ownership political agenda","story":"The impact of coronavirus on the economy means high public spending and state ownership are top of the political agendaBack in December, a major plank of the Conservative party’s general election strategy was to portray Jeremy Corbyn as a Marxist throwback, committed to all sorts of dangerous 1970s lefty ideas such as state ownership and higher public spending.Six months later, Boris Johnson felt the need, when announcing plans to bring forward £5bn of investment in Britain’s clapped-out public infrastructure, to reassure voters that he was “not a communist” and still believed in capitalism.It’s easy to see why the prime minister felt the need to provide some reassurance to his party’s traditional supporters, who believed the Conservatives stood for a small state, free enterprise and sound public finances. Johnson has nationalised the railways, is paying the wages of about a third of the workforce and is on course to borrow more this year than any other prime minister in peacetime. If Corbyn had announced that he was prepared to take a stake in strategically important companies to stop them going bust, Johnson would have been the first to accuse the former Labour leader of “picking winners”. In a Covid-19 world, it is what the government does, if more out of necessity than conviction.Rishi Sunak’s summer statement on the economy on Wednesday is another indication of how things have changed in the first half of 2020. Normally chancellors are tight-fisted in the first year of parliament, getting all the tough decisions on tax and spending over with early so that they can hand out some goodies as election time approaches. They certainly don’t have mini-budgets where they announce that money’s no object if it means saving the National Theatre, or preventing the dole queues from lengthening to four million by the end of the year.To be sure there are experts – Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England for one – who think that the economy is recovering more quickly than expected, but the risk for Sunak is of doing too little rather than too much. His decision to end the government’s furlough scheme in October – when the jobless total is likely to be rising fast – is a colossal gamble and, quite possibly, a huge blunder. State spending takes on extra importance when unemployment is rising because the threat of redundancy leads people to save more. The drop in private spending makes the recession worse unless the government compensates by spending more itself.Michael Devereux, an Oxford university professor, says Sunak should consider topping up the wages of people who have returned to work but are operating at below full capacity, which makes sense given that it will take a long time for many businesses to return to normal trading.It is unlikely to happen though. In part, that’s because of traditional Treasury concerns about handing money to employers who might not need it. It’s also because this is a government that feels queasy about many of the things it is being forced to do.Thus far, there is nothing historically exceptional about what Johnson’s administration has been doing. Governments in the past have expanded the role of the state. They have used fiscal policy – tax, spending and borrowing – aggressively during recessions. They have bailed out troubled companies. They have argued that higher spending on infrastructure will pay for itself by shifting the economy into a higher gear.The problem for the Conservatives is that parties of the left have traditionally been more comfortable pushing these policies than parties of the right. Johnson likes to talk about his brand of one nation Conservatism, but somehow or another he has ended up with an economic strategy rather like that of Harold Wilson’s 1964-70 Labour government, with its National Plan for growth, high levels of public spending and belief in the transformative power of science and technology. It is certainly not Thatcherism, which is why free-market thinktanks are uncomfortable with the government’s direction of travel.For the time being, there is not much those who think Johnson’s dalliance with dangerous leftwing ideas will end in tears can do about it. They can point out that in some ways the lockdown has highlighted the strengths of the market, with many businesses finding all sorts of creative ways to keep themselves going. They also make the point that the way the government has handled the crisis – from its Soviet-style targets for testing to its chaotic air bridges – has not always been the best advertisement for an activist state.Politics goes in cycles and there will eventually be a moment when that thinking resonates with the public, but not now. For the moment, if the opinion polls are to be believed, voters are far more receptive to more stimulus and a rolling back of welfare cuts. The Resolution Foundation thinktank’s proposal for a £200bn spending boost, complete with £500 of spending vouchers for every adult, is far more in tune with the public mood than a return to austerity.This is not entirely surprising. As the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said on Tuesday, a pandemic is the ultimate collective action problem: it is simply not feasible to tell workers and companies that they must survive on their own as best they can when the government itself has been responsible for shutting down the economy.Nor is the mood likely to change all that quickly. The recession of the early 1990s was cured by Britain leaving the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday. Pouring money into the banks was the turning point in the financial crisis of 2008. This time, only a vaccine for Covid-19 will do the trick, and that could be years away.All of which creates a glorious opportunity for the Labour party. It is in the happy position of being able to say that no matter how much the government is spending it should be spending more. It can pick and choose from all the once taboo ideas – such as a basic income, a wealth tax, or printing money to pay for higher public spending – that have become fashionable. A green new deal is now so much part of the mainstream that the prime minister sees himself as the new Franklin D Roosevelt.A word of caution, though. Even assuming that Labour embraces the need for more radical action on global heating, it is not actually in power and won’t be for some time. The government has four years to patch up a dysfunctional economy which, despite all the rhetoric, is what Johnson’s strategy is really all about.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5e714fdf3d7d72ca432ac2c623dfe9063fe70bd/0_198_4832_2898/master/4832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f63f51e8374e1c712c46601fa597d6c","title":"scottish independence english politics coronavirus brexit","story":"After the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit, the union will not be safe with a prime minister who plays with nationalist fireA virus that doesn’t care about nations or history can still spread borders across the map like a rash. Different European countries’ pandemic responses restored boundaries that were meant to be submerged for the cause of continental integration. That effect was less pronounced within the UK, but public health is a devolved matter, so lockdown has probed the tender line where England meets Scotland.There is no Scottish plan to quarantine visitors from England, but Nicola Sturgeon has refused to dismiss the notion completely. Opining on the subject in parliament last week, Boris Johnson offered the untrue and crass assertion that “there is no such thing as a border” between the two nations. The inane gauntlet was taken up by a handful of pro-independence activists over the weekend, who stood at the sign on the A1 welcoming motorists to Scotland with a banner urging the coronavirus-carrying English to stay away.Sturgeon condemned the stunt as not “sensible or helpful” and no doubt she meant it. The first minister is a nationalist but not an Anglophobe fanatic. Her method for dismantling the union has been to entrench SNP control of devolved institutions until it is hard to distinguish party and state. The pursuit of independence then becomes a settled fact about what it means to be the government of Scotland, thus disqualifying pro-union parties. Anyone who doesn’t want independence has to work harder just to join conversations about Scottishness and the future.It is working. The defeat of the “yes” campaign in a referendum has faded in the historical record more than it should for something that happened only six years ago. That whole world looks hazy now through the volcanic ash of subsequent political eruptions – Brexit, which a majority of Scots opposed, then the pandemic.The coronavirus emergency boosted the standing of incumbents in most countries, but that “rallying to the flag” effect has been stronger and lasted longer in Scotland than in England. Even many of Sturgeon’s critics privately concede that she has had a good crisis, leavening executive authority with humility and sincerity – qualities the Tory leader has only read about. The first minister’s personal ratings have soared, which is doubly remarkable since she began the year looking stale in office and unsettled by charges of sexual assault hanging over Alex Salmond, her predecessor and former mentor. (He was acquitted, but the political wound is still open.)Opinion polls show regular majorities for independence, although that masks a common lack of enthusiasm for re-enacting a referendum battle that ided families and polluted friendships. Sturgeon has to appeal to a mainstream that prefers the rhythm of normal government to the relentless beat of the separatist drum, while at her back is an impatient SNP faction that suspects her of getting too cosy with the status quo.It is a sign of how badly the pro-union side failed to embed its victory that the debate on independence is a three-way tussle between “yes, now”, “yes, later” and “let’s not have this argument”. No party is challenging the SNP for control of Holyrood. Labour’s ambitions are limited to winning back second place from the Tories who have stagnated since losing Ruth Davidson’s leadership.Between now and next May’s Scottish parliament elections, Britain must pass through more Brexit turbulence transitional arrangements expire on 31 December. In every scenario, the SNP then complains that English Tories have wrenched pro-European Scots from their home continent without consent. Barring some unforeseen political accident, Sturgeon will then be confirmed as first minister, arguing that her refreshed mandate compels Westminster to legislate for an independence referendum.Johnson will refuse, thus vindicating the nationalist view that Tory England always represses the will of Scotland. But the prime minister might prefer that charge to a gamble on having his remaining time in office consumed by a battle to save the union, and possibly ending up in posterity as the man who broke the kingdom.Downing Street’s Plan A to dampen the clamour for independence was hosing Scotland with public money, but competition for that resource is getting more intense and areas with Conservative MPs are the priority. If there is no sign of a Tory revival north of the border, an even more cynical path might appeal: letting the flames of resentment roar in Scotland, igniting a Johnson-supporting English nationalist backlash. All the better if that sustains the toxic question of whether Labour needs SNP MPs to support a coalition come a general election. It would take an exceptionally irresponsible prime minister on a streak of constitutional pyromania to pursue such tactics. Johnson is qualified.A conflagration in Scotland might not be the next crisis to destabilise Britain, but it is in the queue. It is also unnerving how little England is prepared, when Scottish politics is a rolling rehearsal. That bodes ill for the pro-union cause. English voters who support neither a Tory government nor Scottish independence have no purchase on a debate that is existential for their country, if that country is identified as the UK. Theirs is the queasiness of the spectator with emotional investment in a contest and no influence on the result. That is how my French and German friends described Brexit, which is disturbing because the comparison feels both apt and ridiculous. There is eerie familiarity in the way the pro-union cause is floundering, but it is madness to imagine a cultural border between England and Scotland analogous to the Channel.But the arguments against separation have atrophied from lack of exercise and the nationalist songs have catchier tunes. The SNP strategy is to make independence feel inevitable. It needn’t be, but ergence is the easier trajectory to plot. Meanwhile, the unionist cause has not evolved beyond hoping Sturgeon is wrong, while deferring the moment of asking Scotland the question directly, which is an admission of fear that she is right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0dc9aebaffbed8d6c46837ca4b5e2653d0ae37/4_0_1682_1010/master/1682.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b77ab5dc582509b847d8161764515677","title":"halve uk pesticide use to save insects say conservationists","story":"Wildlife Trusts report also calls for expansion of projects such as flower-rich road verges and butterfly reintroductionsThe use of pesticides in the UK must be at least halved to reverse steep losses in insect abundance and boost the natural world that depends on them, according to a report.It warns that insects are the “canaries in the coal mine” of the natural world and that everyone, including the government, local authorities, community groups and iniduals, needs to become insect champions.“If we get it right for insects we get it right for everything else,” said Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex and lead author of the report. “Insects are the canaries in the coal mine: their collapse is an alarm bell that we must not ignore. Action is needed from every section of society.”The UK produced a National Action Plan on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides in 2013 which is now overdue for review. It was described as “woefully weak” by the Pesticides Action Network, as it set no target for reductions.Groups around the UK have been boosting local insect populations, including the On the Verge project in Stirling, which has now worked with more than 100 schools, local councils, churches and care homes to plant new native wildflower areas. Research shows the verge sites have 25 times more flowers and 50 times more bumblebees than adjacent grass areas that were mown.In the London borough of Lambeth the Incredible Edible food project successfully campaigned to end pesticide use. “Our passion is local food, so insects are really important to us,” said Janie Bickersteth, chair of the Lambeth group. “Lambeth has now agreed to go pesticide free by 2021 and has already stopped spraying in all its parks.”The Kent Wildlife Trust and partners have created 146 roadside nature reserves and 13 “bee roads”, which they call insect superhighways and provide forage and refuge for insects. “The landscape in Kent, like much of the UK, has become increasingly fragmented. But our road networks provide a huge opportunity to help address this issue,” said Rosie Bleet, the trust’s bee roads officer.In May, the Manchester argus butterfly was returned to Astley Moss in Greater Manchester for the first time in over 100 years. It was once common across the region, but due to the destruction of its peatland homes, it had become locally extinct.Insect-friendly farming is also highlighted in the report. Jack Kelly, who has 90 acres of mixed farmland in County Down, has used government-funded agri-environment schemes and voluntary work to create a network of flower and seed-rich habitats, with large hedgerows and wetlands. “I’ve always believed that if you look after nature, it will look after you,” he said. “With insect populations plummeting, we must do everything we can to reverse this trend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a24377fe0101da176a97c50584398c52cef0a20/0_102_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=74007f2d08c2056abb5593e6dda1ca6b","title":"it looked like something i had already eaten the 15 worst reader bakes of lockdown","story":"Britain underwent a baking revolution while stuck at home – but, from claggy loaves to soggy blobs, the results were not always a successSee readers’ best bakes of lockdownMy daughter bought me a breadmaker but my early attempts were marred by a temperamental electronic scale. At least, that’s my excuse for this monstrosity, which looks more like a 70s Doctor Who villain than a white sandwich loaf. Anna Stanford, PR and communications manager, LondonLike everyone else, I thought I’d give baking bread a go during lockdown – not because bread was scarce, but simply to fill the time and make my flat smell nice. I spotted a recipe for beer bread online that looked super easy and used a can of beer instead of having to do anything fiddly with yeast or starters. But the loaf took on a life (and limb!) of its own – I call it my arm bread. It tasted dreadful. Baking bread is not for me.I joined the sourdough revolution during lockdown after seeing a friend’s amazing loaves. My first loaf, however, was a total brick. The starter wasn’t lively enough but, because I was attending a Zoom online baking class, I had to just crack on. When I started making the dough, it just got stickier and stickier. I felt very disheartened and my second attempt was no better. The dough was still sticky, but I read that you could turn it into focaccia, so I tried that. It was still awful. With too much time on my hands and a recent gift of a huge box of cherries, I thought I’d try making a cherry clafoutis. Despite following the recipe, perhaps with just a couple of improvisations, I ended up with what my niece described as looking like something I had already eaten! Even a sprinkling of icing sugar failed to redeem it, but a dollop of vanilla ice-cream did help it go down.My oven broke at the start of lockdown, leaving me and my flatmate to get creative using the hob for a few weeks. (Fried frozen pizza, anyone?) As soon as it was fixed, I went on a baking spree, which was mostly successful, but with two notable failures: the world’s flattest scones (I blame the recipe) and a funfetti cake. The cake was going well until I added the buttercream icing before it was fully cool. Cue melted pools of butter and soggy blobs of cake. It seemed easy enough: make pistachio bars from scratch, rather than using the packaged bright green pudding. It looks lovely in the photo, especially with the sprinkling of crushed pistachios on top, but instead of the pudding being an appetising shade of green, it best resembled poured concrete (in colour, thankfully not in consistency) sandwiched between two layers of cream cheese. I started baking a couple of months ago as a form of therapymindfulness and have mostly been successful. I usually share my baked goods quite proudly with friends. This time, I waited until the cover of darkness to hand it out – it tasted fine, just looked terrible! A dessert best enjoyed with one’s eyes closed.My sourdough-discard crumpets proved disastrous. I got a bit overconfident having finally figured out how to bake a decent sourdough loaf during lockdown – I even made crumpet rings using beer cans to be mega–sustainable – but it became a squidgy, half-burnt mess. They didn’t taste bad though, all things considered.I was experimenting with vegan baking and decided to try meringues using chickpea water. Covid-19 has made me acutely conscious of food waste and I wanted to make the most of my tin of chickpeas. Sadly, I didn’t whip the aquafaba and sugar for long enough (you need to do it until your arm aches … and then some) so they disintegrated in the oven. It looked like I had microwaved a ghost. This is not my bake, but my fiance’s. I had a lockdown birthday, which was mostly fun, and Tom decided he would make his first-ever cake for the occasion. I checked in on him at one point and warned him not to overbeat the mixture – despite it looking like he might have already done so. Our oven also cooks quite hot … It was meant to be a lemon drizzle loaf and I was obviously effusively grateful, but as cakes go, this was definitely a first attempt. Dense, claggy, burnt. That’s love! I decided to make some cheese scones but they tasted really dusty. It turned out our flour was more than 10 years out of date – and had even moved house with us more than seven years previously.I named my sourdough starter after my late dad, as it produces something nice but crusty. This seemed appropriate. I’ve trawled through recipe books and am now speaking a new language of leavens, levains and autolysing. The kitchen is covered in a fine dusting of flour and my husband has put on a stone. I’ve made one passable loaf and one that was as flat as a pancake. I had one that refused to leave the warm embrace of the floured tea towel and this one, which stuck resolutely to the cooking pot. I’m now on to loaf five and if this one doesn’t work then Dad will have to go in the fridge and lie dormant until I summon up the enthusiasm to bring him back to life.Never a confident cook or baker, I have in recent years – now being a parent to a three-year-old – begun to be more adventurous and bold with my kitchen endeavours. I had been enjoying some moderate success in the muffin department. Suitably encouraged, and bolstered by a recent 3kg delivery of then-rarer-than-gold-dust flour, I set out to bake my first cake from scratch. I measured, I sweated and I watched as it baked words cannot describe the pride I felt when I brought out a perfectly baked cake. Worried that I might damage it in my excitement to put it on the cooling rack, I made the fatal error of giving it to my partner to extract ... who promptly tipped it all over the floor. This is Ruby Tandoh’s seeded loaf, or rather seeded brick. I think I let the second prove go on too long and it collapsed with a disappointed sigh when I slashed it. Definitely my fault, not Ruby’s – her walnut cob has been among my top lockdown bakes. Surprisingly, the brick tastes OK when toasted, so I’ll try again. Like yeast, I rise!I thought making a layered strawberry, raspberry and vanilla cheesecake would be a piece of cake. However, the recipe and instructions differed slightly to my usual recipe and I was torn as to which to follow. I went with the new recipe, but didn’t add gelatine, as I’ve never done this. When I tried the mixture, I could not taste any of the fruit flavours, so (without thinking) I added more fruit. I think it was this that led to my disaster of a slopped cheesecake. The flavour was delicious, but the base was so hard that I couldn’t even pull it off as summer fruit mousse. I will be following my usual recipe next time.I somehow managed to score an enormous bag of flour, so decided to satisfy a serious craving for a proper Devon cream tea.

Going from Merseyside shipping clerk to leader of the opposition is certainly a road less travelled, but Foot (himself a Plymouth Argyle fan) did just that, and in January 1935 was lucky enough to be present for one of the greatest games ever staged at Goodison: an FA Cup fourth-round replay against Sunderland the home side won 6-4 after extra time. The experience moved him so much that he wrote a poem about it – “Ode to Everton” – and sent it into the Liverpool Daily Post.

Whether it is a good poem or not really depends on whether or not you like Ivor Cutler.”Ben Wilkinson digs further: “I can happily report many modern poets have written on the beautiful (and not so beautiful) game. I’d recommend checking out Don Paterson’s ‘Nil Nil’, about the ignominious and tragicomic decline of a fictional Scottish football side poet laureate Simon Armitage’s brilliantly titled ‘Goalkeeper with a Cigarette’ Sarah Wardle’s collection Score! (2005), centred around her time as poet-in-residence at Spurs and Neil Rollinson’s ‘The Penalty’. My own debut collection, Way More Than Luck, contains a series of poems exploring the legends and myths of Liverpool FC.” Dave Kirby has also written many poems about Liverpool, and once lamented the gentrification of football in this poem called Jester’s Hats.Away from these shores, Jordi Gomez points us towards ‘Ode to Plattkó’, in which the famous Spanish poet Rafael Alberti immortalises a Barcelona goalkeeper who played on after being knocked out in the 1928 Cup final, where Alberti was watching on from the terraces.To end things on a glamorous note, Simon Brown puts forward the Nottingham poet Rory Waterman, who has wandered lonely as a cloud into the wasteland of lower-league football and emerged with the excitingly titled “Alfreton Town 0, Brackley Town 1 (89’)”:The pitch is white where the sun’s not been seenon its hill-cresting flight. The tea queue is longand shrouded in breath, as men in fat coatsgrunt at each other, though the game’s going on –but I’m on the terrace, with 64 others,where a bloke in a tank-top and built like a tankturns to the dug-outs and breaks the near-silence:‘Cheynge it up, Billeh boy – we’re fukkin’ wank!’Then he faces the game again, squinting upfieldas one of their wingers slaps a long crossout for a throw-in. ‘C’mon lads!’ he bellows,rub-rubbing his hands.So, this loss is his loss,and also his triumph. He boos at the whistle,says ‘See yer’ to others, and runs for a piss,and doesn’t drive home, cross a ground off his list,and know he was no-one. No. He lives for this.Further to last week’s discussion of songs inspired by specific games …MA Kersley pumps up the volume on Coup de Boule by Sébastien and Emmanuel Lipszyc. “It’s about the 2006 World Cup final, with the truly magnifique translated chorus: ‘Zidane hit it, Zidane beat it, headbutt!’”Andy Linehan recommends two songs: “The Real Sounds of Africa’s 13-minute track Tornados v Dynamos (3-3) – it details the game in the title and includes commentary on the goals (plus the arrival of the President of Zimbabwe to watch the game). And to my mind the best ever football record, Pam Pam Cameroon by Macka B, includes references to Maradona and Roger Milla and the refrain ‘against the Cameroon England were lucky, lucky!’”“On 21 April, it was possible that, at the Sunderland v Burton match, both sides could kick off with a mathematical chance of survival but, by full time, each could be relegated. Have there been any examples of two ‘unrelegated teams’ playing each other and both going down at full time?” posed Mark Stephenson in April 2018.Christopher Vaughan got the ball rolling with an example from back when Manchester City were a comedic shambles instead of today’s Pep-fuelled turbo-elite Premier League champions. “On the last day of the 1997-98 season, Manchester City beat Stoke City 5-2 to condemn them to the third flight. Results elsewhere, however, meant a win was not enough for the Laser Blues (as they were known at the time, to promote their kit deal with Kappa) and they joined the Potters in what was then Division Two. The away fans serenaded the Stoke faithful with: “Going down, going down, going down … so are we, so are we, so are weeee-eeee!”And Ben Lander took us to the Madejski Stadium on 28 April 2013 when two teams, who both needed to win to stay up, set about doing absolutely nothing to help their cause. “Reading and QPR started their Premier League fixture knowing mathematically they were able to survive. Both needed a win, a draw would send both down. It finished 0-0.” Whoops.“Has there been a team who has been in every position in the table over the course of a single season?” asks David Esp.“During Crystal Palace v Burnley, Ally McCoist and Jon Champion referred to Roy Hodgson’s age as the oldest-ever Premier League manager and second-oldest in football league history,” says Mark Stephenson. “Given he started managing Halmstad at 29, surely the length of his career must be close to a world record? Can anyone beat a 44-year managerial career?”Eddy from Oxfordshire asks: “Following Diego Costa’s near-heroics against Barcelona on 30 June, has any player actually achieved the magnificent hat-trick of a missed penalty, an own goal and a red card?”“The Derby County website says our record league defeat ever is 8-0 against Blackburn Rovers on 3 January 1891, and our record league win ever is 9-0 against Wolves which was on 10 January 1891,” says Rams fan. “So a plus-17 goal difference from one match to the next. Can anyone better that?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db0f1a677c90b4eb55bde37619f78401c663bc38/0_55_938_563/master/938.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c0380d10987952cceb8b4359a267c67","title":"dundee united glory years under jim mclean part one of two","story":"The best stories from the beautiful game that you may never have heard before, written by some of the world’s leading sports journalists, and ning more than 100 years of sporting history from across the footballing planet.

Assessing Arsenal’s chances of keeping Jamie Vardy quiet with a backline consisting of David Luiz, Shkodran Mustafi and Sead Kolasinac, the former England defender seemed confident enough.“They’re well equipped to deal with Vardy,” Cole told Sky before the match. “He won’t cause them any trouble.” But on a night when Leicester desperately needed their leading man to write another chapter in his remarkable story, the Premier League’s leading goalscorer was always destined to have the last laugh.It has been four years since the striker who was playing for Halifax Town in the Northern Premier League as recently as 2011 decided to turn down the opportunity to join Arsenal in the aftermath of Leicester’s fairytale title. Having gone as far as visiting the club’s London Colney training ground and meeting Arsène Wenger after the Frenchman had triggered his release clause, Vardy famously had a late change of heart and stayed put.Given the relative fortunes of both clubs since, he has no reason to regret that decision. While Arsenal have failed to reach the Champions League since the 2016-17 season when his goals guided Leicester to the quarter-finals of the competition, the 33-year-old has continued to flourish and had taken his Premier League tally to an impressive 101 in 205 appearances after the double against Crystal Palace on Saturday.“I would like to see where Leicester were today without Vardy in the last three years,” Mikel Arteta said before their encounter at the Emirates Stadium.Having missed out on the Golden Boot to Harry Kane in 2016, the showdown with Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was the perfect opportunity for Vardy to consolidate his two-goal lead over his closest challenger this season. Yet, as Cole also pointed out before kick-off, the absence of the injured James Maddison meant Leicester have lacked creativity of late and their talisman was restricted to one shot from outside the box in the first half that was easily saved by Emiliano Martínez. Arteta felt Vardy was lucky to escape a red card after his left foot caught Mustafi in the eye during one coming together and it was a decision that would prove crucial.Instead, it was left to Aubameyang to score his 52nd Premier League goal in 80 appearances after a superb assist from the rising star Bukayo Saka – a phenomenal record that even Vardy cannot match. Aubameyang’s future in north London has yet to be confirmed, as contract talks continue behind the scenes, although official pictures released by Arsenal this week of him modelling next season’s training kit sent speculation that he could be staying into overdrive.Wary of committing to another expensive contract in the region of Mesut Özil’s £350,000-a-week deal, Arteta must decide whether to cash in on a player who has spent much of the season playing out of position on the left flank but is still in the running to win the award he shared with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané last season. You can imagine another season in the Europa League will not hold much appeal for Aubameyang, either.Operating in support of Alexandre Lacazatte, the 31-year-old showed once more that his game is not only about scoring as Arsenal attempted to defend their lead in the second half, even providing willing assistance to Kieran Tierney when called upon. But while Arteta would undoubtedly acknowledge his importance to his young side, Vardy’s late equaliser and 22nd league goal of the season was yet another illustration of how much Leicester’s chances of reaching the Champions League rest on his shoulders.After Vardy provided two perfect crosses for Kelechi Iheanacho that were the closest they had come to breaking the deadlock, his golden opportunity to score at the home of the club he rejected seemed to have finally arrived in the 66th minute, only for Vardy to barely make contact with the ball with his left foot.

When his moment duly arrived, there was no way Vardy would miss again. “It was all about being patient,” he said afterwards. Bournemouth’s leaky defence must be quaking in their boots before Leicester’s visit to the south coast on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d3a5515966b58ef505b39bf2d167f8e9852f100/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8da76a7a7b5162d8101ad529ddfacd26","title":"poor nutrition in developing countries is costing firms 850bn annually report","story":"Business is paying a high price for inadequate diets of employees, research shows, with experts calling on companies to provide living wage and subsidised foodMalnutrition among workers in developing countries is costing businesses up to $850bn (£676bn) a year, according to analysis of the hidden impact of poor diet on productivity.Productivity losses due to employees underperforming because they are underweight cost companies up to $38bn (£30bn) a year across the 19 countries studied, while losses due to obesity cost up to $27bn (£21bn), researchers found. They scaled up the findings to estimate the cost to all businesses in all low- and middle-income countries.Laura Wellesley, senior research fellow at Chatham House and lead author of the report said: “We’ve known for a long time the impact of malnutrition on society and the huge costs to governments, but the impact on businesses has been overlooked.”“Poor employee nutrition is a significant, but poorly understood challenge for businesses operating in low- and middle-income countries,” said Wellesley. “Undernutrition and obesity are causing big losses across all sectors, and many businesses face a double burden of costs from both obese and undernourished workers.”The report was funded by the Power of Nutrition, a charitable foundation supported by a number of multinational companies including Bayer, Kellogg’s and Unilever. It recommends that companies implement workplace policies on nutrition, such as support for breastfeeding mothers, regular nutritional health checks and the provision of nutritious and subsidised food at work.It also urged that – in addition to tackling malnutrition via social responsibility programmes – companies pay a living wage so that employees can afford good food."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06e9f9e72590cbb27df5268a774113aa68ab2c96/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=990a680b31cb10120fb85dedc96bdcd1","title":"childfree why i dont have children freedom","story":"Every day I don’t buy diapers, I’m sticking it to the man. And I have the time to think, to be creative and to cultivate a careerLast autumn, I fell in love for the first time in at least 20 years.That enormous feeling overwhelmed me like fall in New England or a natural disaster. I knew I was in serious trouble when I found myself patiently, even blissfully, ironing his shirts. Who the hell am I right now, my besotted self thought. In a flash of recognition, I knew: I was a woman taking care of a man.Cue my dormant alarm system, long ago set to self-preservation, now rebooted with a scream and a blare. Domestic tasks, particularly those in service of a man, are a well-established signal for me to run as fast as I can the other way. Snap out of it, this is a trap! Care is a woman’s most dangerous gateway drug. Pick up the dry-cleaning once and the next thing you know, you’re knocked up and wondering where your writing career went.Just don’t get pregnant, is the most salient bit of advice my orced father ever gave me.It takes a lot of money, discipline and medical access to not have children. There’s also some hell to pay for it, even today: namely, the too-personal inquiries (our female bodies are never our own), the loss of social status (mothers are the moral future of the nation) and the steady blows to our respectability that society gleefully lands.As I’ve aged – I’ll turn 52 this year – my appreciation for the liberties I’ve chosen has only grown. Like a free agent, I’ve always revelled in my actions without restrictions, my decisions without ramifications. I could move to the other side of the country, then move back spend three months making sandwiches in a cafe in Alaska throw all my savings into a furniture store for a short year then cut and run with a backpack across the African continent for another.I loved, lived, and slept with whomever I pleased. I keep a Post-it in my wallet that says, “I can do anything I want to.”But the freedoms that come with childlessness are much more profound than the thrill of wild adventure, wild sex or wild precarity. I have the time to think, to be creative, to cultivate a career of my own curation. Now that I am biologically incapable of having children, thanks to menopause, I have a fresh perspective on the nature and possibility of reproductive choice.When speaking with younger female friends who are struggling with the children question, I rely on different arguments to reassure them that it is absolutely possible to have a satisfying and fulfilling life without children.Among them: every day I didn’t buy diapers, I was sticking it to the man. The American Dream is a corporate wet dream: the house with a two-car garage, white picket fence, and an UPPAbaby Vista stroller for $899.99.Neoliberalism offered little relief, seeing women who were liberated from the kitchen as a new and exploitable sector of the workforce. Paying women less than men – in 2019 women earn 79 cents to every male dollar – serves two nefarious purposes: it provides corporations with discounted labor, and it keeps women dependent on men.(Let me tell you ladies, nothing makes it easier to get out of a bad or even violent marriage than having your own money.)Still, domesticity is a compelling narrative, the story of a life of order, stability and security – and most of all, enduring love.I’ve fallen for it a couple of times. Birth control set me free.By gendering domestic labor – women’s work is cleaning, cooking, caring for children, spouses, and increasingly, elders – religious conservatives (and let’s be honest, society at large) ensure that male headship and female subservience continue.Once I figured out that if I didn’t dirty the dishes I didn’t have to wash them, I was liberated from unfair and unequal domestic responsibilities. It’s much harder to get out from under domestic labor when you have children, your husband earns more than you do, and daycare costs more than you would earn at a job.What’s more, women are still told that our value is in our domestic achievements, so we put our all into being good homemakers, mothers and wives. “It’s hard for me to understand when cooking became more repression than liberation,” Lyz Lenz wrote for Glamour in 2018, “more act of obligation than act of creation. This thing that had sustained me now felt like a prison. And whose fault was it? It certainly wasn’t all my husband’s.” We fool ourselves (and each other) into thinking that if we love the task, we’re not oppressed.If our labor is coded as love and kindness, those most feminine qualities, or even achievement and pleasure, men are free to pursue their own interests without being encumbered with family care. Lenz’s husband used to rate her meals, never giving her a five out of five because he didn’t want her to stop trying so hard to please him. That’s patriarchy, sisters.There’s no way I could do what my sister – the mother of two teenagers, and a homeowner with two part time jobs – does in a day. Nor would I want to.If time is money, time is also children. Mothers today can have everything – marriage, a career, a beautiful, clean home, health insurance, doting children – but only if they can afford the domestic help doing so requires.Not having children has allowed me to direct that time and attention to my work and my community. And if the world needs anything right now, it’s strong communities.I spent thousands of dollars and countless time and anxiety trying not to get pregnant during my reproductive years. Two abortions and decades of birth control later, I’m one of the lucky ones.Around the world and across the US women still struggle to control their own reproductive health. Recent attacks on abortion and birth control are as revanchist as they are destructive to women.Family planning, studies continuously show, improves the lives of women and children, from better health outcomes to higher education rates. We honor the lives of our sisters by working to preserve access and affordability of reproductive services.There are other misleading stories that young women are told about not having children. Once and for all, let’s dispel them: everyone dies alone and having children will not ensure that someone will sit by your deathbed nor can we expect our children to financially or emotionally support us (and besides, that’s a terrible expectation) women are no better at so-called domestic tasks than men, we’ve just been scapegoated into cleaning and cooking sure enough, a mother’s children are the most important thing in her life, but if you have no children, well, some other most important thing gets room to be and become.By some luck of the draw, some DNA hiccup, by the lessons of a hideous childhood and the measure of the lives of my female forebears, I knew early on that I wasn’t cut out to be a mother. Or, to put it quite another way, I intuited that I had different priorities – and options! – than my meticulous Mennonite grandmother, who raised four children, kept a one-acre garden, taught preschool at church and cleaned the house, top to bottom, (even behind the refrigerator) the very same day every week for more than six dozen years.Menopause has only added more nuance to the vital question, who the hell am I right now?I am a woman who has no regrets about not having children and who knows the clear difference between caring for others and respecting myself. It is our obligation as women to help others understand and embrace this difference.

I moved into my home in Hove last December. British Gas was the provider, but I immediately switched to Octopus having settled my final bill. I later received a letter from British Gas stating that I owed money for gas and electricity. My surname was misspelled and the debt applied to an address in Glasgow.I have never in my life been to Glasgow. British Gas blamed a computer error and told me the account had been cancelled, but more letters arrived about the same bill. I was again reassured that the account had been cancelled. Then came a red “final demand”.Customer services told me it was a mistake and I should ignore it. I next received a letter from a debt recovery firm. I phoned but my date of birth did not match its records and I was required to send a copy of my passport. By now over four months had passed.I contacted British Gas again and was assured that the issue would be resolved, but I’ve since received another letter from the debt recovery agent saying that British Gas has confirmed I owe the money and requiring evidence I don’t live in Glasgow.I have sent my council tax bill for the period in question to prove this. I’m anxious and so frustrated and cannot see a way out of this nightmare.SMW, BrightonThis is a shocking case of corporate lethargy. It sounds as though a tracing service was used to find the errant Glaswegian debtor and, because your first names were the same, and your unusual surname similar, they hit on you at the other end of the country.The saga should have ended when you first confirmed your identity the fact that British Gas only put a stop to it when I got in touch is shameful. It blamed an “internal error” for linking you with the indebted stranger and apologised for not resolving it sooner. It has since called off the debt collection agency.Luckily no markers had yet been recorded on your credit file, otherwise your creditworthiness might have been affected.

She talks about her fight to remain – and strengthening her rootsDuring lockdown, UK jazz artist Bumi Thomas has found space to spread out in her local park. “I take my guitar and howl,” she laughs. “I love it!” As the world starts to understand just how much black women feel they have to reduce themselves, it’s soothing to think of a carefree Thomas filling public space with highlife and jazz melodies.She tells me about a Peter Adjaye livestream she’s been dancing to and speaks with what she calls a “transatlantic twang”, a blend of a Hausa accent from her years living in Nigeria, the place of her parents’ birth a distinct international-school American lilt and strands of Glasgow and London. Then there is the influence of Yoruba, “a very deep and brooding language that comes from a different part of your mouth and body,” she says. “I learned it later in life singing Fela Kuti songs. And there’s a connection to the blues I grew up singing, like Miles Davis and Muddy Waters.”Last year, Thomas was preparing to bring that rich voice to bear in a performance in LA with the Moroccan visual artist Hassan Hajjaj. The next day, she woke up to a letter and felt the earth give way. Thomas was born in Glasgow in June 1983 after the Thatcher government’s British Nationality Act had come into force in January of that year it stated that children born to parents from the colonies were no longer entitled to automatic citizenship. The letter informed Thomas – who has lived in the UK solidly since she was 17 – that she had 14 days to leave the country or make herself subject for deportation or detainment.“I couldn’t believe what I was reading” she says. “I felt nauseous. I sat down everything was spinning. It was terrifying. There’s a section at the end that says: you do not have the right to work, you do not have the right to rent property, your bank account can be frozen. It’s like someone is suffocating you.” LA was off she started making calls. “I picked up the phone and heard myself telling people, ‘I just got my refusal.’”Thomas was one of thousands of people with roots in former colonies, including the Windrush generation, who were made suddenly precarious thanks to a renewed “hostile environment” policy. She had, like many others, assumed she was a British citizen with dual nationality – the 1983 change “was not well communicated to the public in the UK or in the colonies”. After all, her sister, born in the same circumstances but before 1983, was British.Community activists crowdfunded Thomas’s legal fees, created a petition that drew 25,000 signatures, and alerted the media. An immigration tribunal judge ruled in favour of withdrawing the threat of deportation, but she must wait two years before she can apply for British citizenship. Her status is still at the mercy of a isive immigration policy.During this period of statelessness, somehow, Thomas was writing songs. They ended up on Broken Silence, her gloriously joyful jazz EP, out last month. On it, she defines herself not by the language of the British state but in the power of ancestral sounds across the African continent and beyond. She describes the devotional-sounding udu drum that appears on Black Child with reverence: “A vessel used by Igbo women to fetch water from a stream, and based on the amount of water in it, it has this fantastic bass sound and you can tune it to different tones.”The hostility of the Home Office renewed an urge to root herself in her own history. In the early 70s, Thomas’s parents owned a hair salon in Glasgow called Hairlynks, the site of significant black music history that attracted artists and creatives, and saw a young Sade singing there, according to the memory archives of locals. “Before that, if you were in the Highlands, you’d have to go to London to get your hair done,” Thomas laughs. Through the shop’s sound system, the young Thomas took in the rhythms of a black artistic community through the braids and chatter.Further back, she discovered her father’s Afro-Brazilian roots dating back to the 19th century, and the musical hangover of Nigeria’s historical Portuguese occupation. On Lesso Lesso, she pays homage to this, singing in Portuguese, English and Yoruba, featuring a sample from her dad sent over WhatsApp voice notes. The loose translation of his Yoruba instructs her: be careful with your heart, go gently, gently.Gently advocating for black joy feels radical in a world often unsympathetic to global black trauma. For Thomas, this moment of mobilisation chimes with her own personal battle with a system that has uprooted her sense of home.“At times, the music feels likes protest,” she sighs. “When I sang before, it had meaning, but not the same resonance. I went to a Black Lives Matter protest a few weeks ago and someone had a boombox and played A Change Is Gonna Come. It is all … emotional.”She takes a breath. “I’ve been feeling so much. You are forced to choose to shrink or expand yourself.” For now, she chooses expansion: taking her guitar to the park, singing songs that cross borders, restricted by nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e3bcf27c738c1a9f5621920d46cadf518962d1/0_154_2848_1708/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=323b6530364202f602910467e8ef79e7","title":"taking on sir humphrey can the civil service be reformed podcast","story":"Michael Gove has set out his plans for a revolution of Britain’s permanent bureaucracy, the civil service.

Philip Hammond settled for a personalised Emma Bridgewater mug emblazoned with his name.But the current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, appears to have gone one step further in the traditional pre-budget photo opportunity by posing with a “smart mug” costing £180.A series of snaps released by the Treasury show Sunak at work, with the expensive gadget on his desk as he pores over the details of the mini-budget he will deliver to the Commons on Wednesday.The Ember travel mug, reportedly a gift from his wife, Akshata Murthy, the daughter of a billionaire businessman, retails for up to £179.95 online, with a product description boasting that it “does more than simply keep your coffee hot”.It adds: “Our smart mug allows you to set an exact drinking temperature and keeps it there for up to three hours, so your coffee is never too hot, or too cold.” The 355ml mug is apparently dishwasher safe and even includes a charging coaster.It is a far cry from the image of Osborne chomping on fast food that he tweeted in 2013 on the night before he delivered the comprehensive spending review. The picture prompted ridicule, with the then chancellor accused of a misguided attempt to project a populist image. The Sun pointed out that the cheapest Byron burger was priced at £6.75, with the lowest priced McDonald’s at 99p.Osborne saw the funny side and later tweeted: “There I am working late on my speech, and I’ve got a takeaway hamburger, but it puts you on the front page of the Sun. It’s an occupational hazard.”In 2018, Hammond was pictured slurping from an Emma Bridgewater mug with his name and “chancellor” on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b17154d82df917e93708c6e705074100ece2f620/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=730944e3cf6019db294cda7791b59b43","title":"summer statement rishi sunak plans temporary job creation scheme for under 25s","story":"Six-month placements aim to help those hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdownRishi Sunak will respond to growing fears of a surge in youth unemployment from Britain’s pandemic-scarred economy on Wednesday with a £2bn temporary job creation scheme for the under-25s.Amid evidence that the fallout from the Covid-19-enforced lockdown has hit vulnerable young workers harder than other age groups, the chancellor will use his summer statement to announce that the government will fund six-month job placements for an estimated 350,000 18 to 24-year-olds.Sunak will announce a three-point strategy to support, protect and retain jobs but Whitehall’s concern about an imminent 1980s-style increase in youth unemployment was reflected in the government’s willingness to revive an idea used by Labour during the global financial crisis, and in the rapid timetable for the “kickstart scheme” to become operational.The Treasury said companies could start making applications for the jobs subsidies within a month and the first young people would be employed in the autumn.Although the economy is starting to open up gradually after its pandemic-enforced quarantining, Sunak has decided it is too risky to wait for his autumn budget to come up with a jobs package to help the heavy concentrations of young people working in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors.Alongside the youth scheme, the chancellor will announce a £3bn programme to make homes and public buildings more environmentally friendly. According to reports, he will announce an immediate stamp duty holiday for homes at the lower end of the market, and cuts to VAT are also reportedly under consideration. The chancellor said: “Young people bear the brunt of most economic crises, but they are at particular risk this time because they work in the sectors disproportionately hit by the pandemic.“We also know that youth unemployment has a long-term impact on jobs and wages and we don’t want to see that happen to this generation. So we’ve got a bold plan to protect, support and create jobs – a Plan for Jobs.”People under 25 receive a lower national minimum wage, starting at £4.55 an hour for someone under 18, rising to £6.45 an hour for 18 to 20-year-olds and £8.20 an hour for 21 to 24-year-olds. The scheme is mainly aimed at people aged 18 and above because most 16 and 17-year-olds are in education or apprenticeships.The chancellor’s proposal received a cautious welcome from UK trade union body the TUC. Its general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Unions have been pushing hard for a jobs guarantee for young workers who lose their jobs during this crisis.“The chancellor has made a good first step. But we’ll be checking the small print to ensure every job provides proper training and a bridge to steady employment.“Employers must do the right thing. They should work with unions to avoid job displacement, create good opportunities for all young workers and guarantee they are paid at least the real living wage.“We must do all we can to avoid the misery of mass unemployment. The government should bring business and unions together in a national recovery council so working people are not made to pay the price of this crisis and ensure we build back better, right across the country.”In the first two months of the Covid-19 crisis the number of 18 to 24-year-olds claiming universal credit rose by a quarter of a million to almost 500,000, while 700,000 school leavers and university graduates will enter a depressed jobs market this summer.The Treasury said the subsidised jobs would give young people the opportunity to build their skills in the workplace, and to gain experience that will improve their chances of going on to find long-term sustainable work. Sunak is also expected to announce a £111m investment to triple the scale of traineeships in 2020-21, and an extra £32m for the National Careers Service.Kathleen Henehan, an economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “It is very welcome that the government has opted for a bold and ambitious scheme, with £2bn potentially meaning jobs for around 350,000 young people. This is exactly the kind of approach needed, learning the lessons of what worked in the financial crisis.“History also shows that it is crucial that these jobs are created quickly, with local authorities crucial in making that happen at anything like the scale the government intends. Three hundred and fifty thousand new jobs would be three times as many as were created under the Future Jobs Fund following the financial crisis, so delivery on this scale will be a huge challenge.”The chancellor rebuffed calls from Labour to leave the scheme in place for the hardest-hit industries, saying it would remain a nationwide “general subsidy” and would be scaled back next month before closing in October as previously announced.He also resisted pressure to offer extra help to the 1 million self-employed workers who miss out on all of the government’s subsidy schemes. “In terms of the design and the duration with which it lasts, the breadth of its coverage and the generosity of its support, it remains the most generous self-employment support scheme in the world,” he said.Conservative backbenchers have largely welcomed the government’s big-spending approach to tackling the Covid-19 downturn, though some traditionalists are beginning to sound the alarm.Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the veteran Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh said: “Can we hear from the chancellor and the prime minister less about high-spending lefties like President Roosevelt and more about good Conservatives like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher – less about subsidies and more about tax cuts and tax simplification?”Johnson appeared to hint last week that taxes could rise to pay for his spending plans, but he told the Yorkshire Post on Monday he has not abandoned a manifesto pledge not to raise the rates of national insurance, income tax or VAT. Other measures expected to be announced by the chancellor on Wednesday include a £3bn plan to green the economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4191ae7083717f58208cfcf20a8a3b1493cc1c9e/1109_947_3213_1928/master/3213.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5544ef013231a78a7c822f5377e346c5","title":"my online business flourished the ethical brand that boomed when the high street shut down","story":"Kaela Mills had to shut her Bexhill childrenswear shop because of the coronavirus crisis, but she soon found success thanks to her savvy decision to expand her websiteWhen the government announced its lockdown measures for the UK, Kaela Mills felt decidedly gloomy about the future of her ethical childrenswear brand, Sprout. “When everything first started, I genuinely didn’t think my business was going to make it through,” she says. “Not knowing how long the lockdown was going to last was incredibly anxiety-inducing. I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Underpinning such a boost in online sales is Mills’ savvy decision to expand her website and ersify into other online marketplaces such as Etsy. Where she would once open the shop six days a week and make daily post runs, Mills was only able to manage twice-weekly trips to her workshop at the beginning of lockdown because she was juggling work and childcare. Postage was reduced to once a week. But the extra time proved just what she needed. “When I wasn’t able to get to my workshop and sew, I was spending a lot more time doing computer work, and that has had a hugely positive impact on the business now,” she says. “I’ve managed to do a lot of stuff that I’ve been meaning to do for years but literally not had the time!”As well as bolstering her online presence, Mills used lockdown to work on another long-held goal: expanding into womenswear. Her new line of made-to-measure women’s underwear, crafted from the same organic, colour-clash fabrics that make her childrenswear so popular, immediately became Sprout’s bestselling range.As well as her efforts in keeping the business alive and thriving during lockdown, Mills also credits consumers thinking more carefully about what and how they’re buying. “People have been looking at more sustainable ways of buying and my stuff is all organic – that’s why I thought it was important to go into doing some adult designs. Sales of my reusable products, such as reusable wipes and makeup pads, have also been huge,” she says.Sustainability is not just an extra selling point for Sprout, it’s something that has earned Mills a loyal community of like-minded customers. While face-to-face interaction has been impossible, Mills has found her brand’s Facebook group to be an essential source of positivity and communication, spotlighting it as one of her favourite aspects of the business. An 800-strong online community share photos of their “Sproutlets”, and buy and sell pre-loved Sprout items. The latter is something Mills is particularly proud of, as it’s proof in action of the longevity of her clothes. “You’ll see this pair of dungarees will be traced back through three or four different children,” she says. “That’s the whole point of my business. They last and they’re not disposable.”While the online side of the business has been booming and her community has prospered through social media, Mills is looking forward to the social interaction that her shop provides when she reopens. “People really love being able to see and feel the quality of the clothes, and it’s lovely when someone wanders in off the street, discovers my brand and becomes a regular customer,” she says.Opening with reduced hours at first, Mills believes it will take time for the high street to get back to where it was and is grateful for support from Visa’s shop local campaign. “It’s a real positive for such a huge brand to be supporting small businesses, it’s a bare essential to us,” she says.Those who venture on to their local high street and into Sprout’s workspace will gain a renewed connection between maker and consumer, as Mills makes each piece right there on the shop floor, an unusual sight when so much of clothing manufacturing happens overseas and behind closed doors. “When parents come in with their children, they’ll sit and watch me sew for a while. I think it’s important for children to know where their clothes are from, to see how it all works,” she says. “It’s been really weird working in here with the blinds down and the door locked. I’m looking forward to opening.”Shop local.

Uber will buy the naming rights for the 20-strong fleet of river boats and Thames Clipper’s piers from Putney to Woolwich, in a rolling contract expected to last for at least three years.A move into fix-scheduled commuter boats is a first for Uber. Users will still pay the same price and although there are hopes for an integrated service, for now they will not be able to book an end-to-end journey with a connecting car. Thames Clippers tickets will still be available to buy elsewhere and the boats remain part of the Oyster network.Sean Collins, Thames Clippers’ co-founder and chief executive, said: “In our 22nd year of operation it is key that we continue to support London and its commuters with the ease of lockdown and return to work. The new partnership will allow us to link the two travel modes of river and road, providing Londoners and visitors with even more options to commute, visit, explore and enjoy our city by river.”Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, Jamie Heywood, said: “Many Londoners are looking for new ways to travel around the city, particularly when they start commuting back to work.”The boat service resumed on 15 June after being closed when the coronavirus outbreak took hold. It has reduced capacity and passengers must wear face masks, in line with Transport for London (TfL) guidance. Last year 4.3m passengers used the Thames Clippers service, which remains majority-owned by AEG, the owner-operators of the O2 entertainment venue.TfL has yet to renew Uber’s licence to operate private hire cars in London. Uber’s application for a new licence was rejected in November because of safety fears after some drivers were found to have faked their identity. It has been allowed to continue operating pending an appeal – which was originally due to have been heard in a magistrate’s court this week. However, because of the impact of the pandemic on TfL’s resources, the hearing has been postponed until September.TfL said it granted licences to river operators such as Thames Clippers “who comply with our high safety standards” but played no role in any partnerships with other businesses and organisations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. On the path to this goal, they’ve released their first hybrid SUV, the CR-V, which features Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) technology, enabling it to shuffle seamlessly between power sources.

The review of vaginal mesh, hormonal pregnancy tests and anti-epilepsy medicine that harmed unborn babies paints a damning picture of a medical establishment that failed to acknowledge problems even in the face of mounting safety concerns, leading to avoidable harm to patients. Instead, women routinely had symptoms attributed to psychological issues or it being “that time of life”. The report’s wide-ranging recommendations include appointing an independent patient safety commissioner, an overhaul of the healthcare products regulatory agency and the expansion of the General Medical Council register to include a list of financial interests for all doctors.Clamp for carers – Free parking for NHS staff at hospitals will end, the government has announced, casting further doubt on its priorities in handling the coronavirus crisis.

Today they publish details of more than 40 UK patients who have suffered complications ranging from brain inflammation and delirium to nerve damage and stroke – in some cases the problem was their first and main symptom. The cases reveal a rise in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Adem). One woman aged 59 died of the complication.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has pointed to the US in warning against trying to do “everything at the same time” in getting daily life back to normal. “We see that in many states in America right now, a spiralling out of control. We mess with this virus at our peril.” The Trump administration has notified the WHO it will cancel its membership from May 2021 – a decision Joe Biden says he will reverse if he wins this November’s election. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, perhaps the world’s foremost naysayer regarding the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic, has confirmed his own illness with the virus.‘Return or kill yourself’ – China is blackmailing dissenters in the US to come home and hand themselves in by using threats against family members and other means, the FBI chief says. The covert campaign is known as Operation Fox Hunt. Christopher Wray said in a speech that Beijing’s counterintelligence work poses the “greatest long-term threat to our nation’s information and intellectual property and to our economic vitality”. He said Fox Hunt began ostensibly as a campaign to bring to justice corrupt officials and business executives who had fled overseas, but had turned into a sinister programme to suppress dissent and criticism of President Xi Jinping among the Chinese diaspora.

Because those smaller exhaled particles can linger in the air, the scientists in the group had been urging WHO to update its guidance.“We wanted them to acknowledge the evidence,” said Jose Jimenez, a chemist at the University of Colorado who signed the paper.“This is definitely not an attack on the WHO. It’s a scientific debate, but we felt we needed to go public because they were refusing to hear the evidence after many conversations with them,” he told Reuters.Jimenez said historically, there has been a fierce opposition in the medical profession to the notion of aerosol transmission, and the bar for proof has been set very high. A key concern has been a fear of panic.“If people hear airborne, healthcare workers will refuse to go to the hospital,” he said. Or people will buy up all the highly protective N95 respirator masks, “and there will be none left for developing countries.”The WHO briefing came as the United States government gave formal notification of its intention to leave the organisation next year. Washington has accused the WHO of being too close to the government in Beijing and of not giving the world enough warning about the dangers of the coronavirus after it emerged in China in January.The move has almost no support from other countries and Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, said he would not follow through with the withdrawal if he is elected in November and said the US should instead push for reform of the WHO.Jeff Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations subcommittee that oversees multilateral institutions, called the move “a huge win for China and a huge blow to the American people”.The US edged closer to recording 3 million cases of Covid-19 on another day of sharp rises across southern and south-western states. Both California and Texas reported more than 10,000 new cases on Tuesday.Some reports said the US had already passed the latest milestone in what is the largest outbreak in the world. But figures from Johns Hopkins University said there were just under 2,995,000 by Tuesday evening out of global total of 11.79m infections.More than 130,000 people have died in the US and Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s leading infectious diseases expert, said it was still “knee-deep” in the pandemic.The president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has tested psoitive for Covid-19. “There’s no reason for fear. That’s life,” said Bolsonaro, a rightwing populist who has consistently rubbished the risks from the disease even as it the country has racked up 1.6 million cases and seen 66,000 of its people die.In Australia there was chaos at the border between Victoria and New South Wales as roads linking the two states were closed for the first time in 100 years in an effort to suppress an outbreak of Covid in the former’s capital, Melbourne.Motorists endured long waits as they exited Victoria at the border town of Wodonga, with police checking every driver that they had a permit to leave.There were 127 new cases of Covid-19 in Victoria on Tuesday, the state premier said on Wednesday morning, down from 191 the day before.Israel’s public health chief has resigned in protest at the government’s handling of the crisis and a big rise in coronavirus cases.The country was praised for its strict initial lockdown in March but the reopening of schools, bars and restaurants has seen the outbreak worsen and many restrictions have been reimposed.Siegal Sadetzki announced her resignation with a lengthy critique of how the government had “lost its bearings”.An opposition MP in New Zealand will step down at September’s general election after it emerged that he leaked details of Covid-19 patients in an effort to expose what he claimed was the government’s mishandling of the crisis.And in Auckland, a man with Covid-19 who was being quarantined in a hotel managed to escape and make a dash to the supermarket for supplies. He has been charged with breaking new quarantine laws."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9bb3e0d9cb5622f2258a3660b23bae2bb107ef4/0_106_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fa0378e7ebbba4d991846347cf3f6ac","title":"indonesias yadnya kasada festival in pictures","story":"During the annual Yadnya Kasada festival, the Tenggerese people climb Mount Bromo, an active volcano, and seek the blessing of the gods by presenting offerings of rice, fruit, livestock and other items.

One Tory former minister told the FT:We had one candidate who might have been acceptable to Europe but was unacceptable to Downing Street, and another candidate acceptable to Number 10 but not to the EU.Here is Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, on the plan to scale back free hospital parking for NHS staff. (See 9.34am.)Alex Flynn, chief of staff at the BMA, had a better version of the “clamp carers” line in a tweet last night.It sounds like we might be getting a U-turn of sorts today over hospital parking charges for NHS staff.The provision of free parking for National Health Service staff by NHS trusts has not ended and nothing has changed since the announcement on 25 March. However, free parking for staff has only been made possible by support from local authorities and independent providers and this support cannot continue indefinitely.We also want the NHS to deliver on the government’s commitment on free hospital parking for those in greatest need, the disabled, frequent outpatient attendees, parents who have sick children that are staying overnight in hospital and staff working nightshifts. Implementation of this commitment has been on hold whilst the NHS has been managing the Covid-19 pandemic and devoting its hospital parking capacity to staff and other facilities necessary for managing the pandemic.The question was tabled by Labour’s Rachael Maskell.Nicky Morgan, the Tory peer and former culture secretary, has been giving interviews this morning and, as the ’s Cat Neilan points out, she changed her line between interviews, suggesting there may have been a rethink.In fact, the rethink had already started last night. This is what the Department of Health and Social Care told PA Media in response to the Independent story, and the statement stresses that NHS staff will continue to get free parking at hospitals “in certain circumstances”. A DHSC spokesperson said:We want to make sure NHS staff can travel safely to work during the pandemic, which is why we requested that the NHS make parking free for staff, and that local authorities do the same with their car parks.When the pandemic begins to ease, the NHS will continue to provide free hospital car parking to key patient groups and NHS staff in certain circumstances. We will provide further updates on this in due course.This may just be a reference to staff working nightshifts getting free parking (a proposal confirmed by Argar), but the tone of the statement is slightly different from that adopted in the written answer.Ian Blackford, the SNP’S leader at Westminster, says all hospital parking charges should be abolished.Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver.Today we will be focusing mostly on what is being described as the chancellor’s “summer economic update” - a quasi budget that will set out a range of coronavirus economic recovery measures. (Although technically not a budget, which means that it won’t be accompanied by the normal set of forecasts from the OBR, in spending terms it will dwarf a routine budget.)Here are the key timings.12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs.12.30pm: Rishi Sunak delivers the summer economic update.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has urged the government to guarantee a real living wage for the lowest paid workers.Speaking on Sky News he challenged Rishi Sunak to show a genuine commitment to the Conservative’s promise to “level up” society. He said:There are millions of people in the north of England on low paid insecure contracts. And I keep hearing that, if they have symptoms, or if they get a message from the test and trace system, they can’t go off work, because they know they won’t be paid.Two million people in our country have no access to statutory sick pay. And for those who do it’s £95 a week. This virus has hit the poorest communities hardest because of the really poor nature of people’s work up and down the country. This is why I’m a bit worried about this statement today from a chancellor. I don’t hear proper measures to level up the country here. If it was really going to do that, he would say the people who’ve been out running the country for the last three months, ‘we’re going to make sure they all have a real living wage’. That is levelling up.Burnham also warned that a stamp duty holiday would not tackle inequality.He said: “I’m worried that we’re noticing another big political moment pass here from the chancellor, where we haven’t got substance behind this phrase ‘levelling up’.” The online fashion retailer Boohoo has announced it will launch an independent review of its UK supply chain after recent allegations that some factories in Leicester that sell clothes to Boohoo pay workers below the minimum wage and failed to protect them from coronavirus.Boohoo, which owns brands including PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, said the review will be led by Alison Levitt QC, and said it would initially invest £10m towards “eradicating malpractice” in its supply chain.The company said in a statement that the board was “shocked and appalled by the recent allegations” and was committed to working to rebuild the reputation of textile manufacturing in Leicester.Greenpeace activists have replaced the destinations on the road signs around parliament to read “Green Recovery”. The stunt was designed to highlight Greenpeace’s view that the government only has one option with its economic recovery package, and that much greater investment is needed to green the transport, energy, housing and waste sectors, create new green jobs and tackle the climate emergency.It comes as the government is threatened with legal action over the expected lack of green measures in the summer statement. On Tuesday, a letter threatening court action was sent to the prime minister and the chancellor by the pressure group Plan B, which successfully took the government to the appeal court this year over its green light for the expansion of Heathrow airport.Sunak will set out £3bn of green spending, focusing on improving energy efficiency in homes and public buildings, in his summer statement on Wednesday. But the letter contrasts this sum with the billions committed to airlines and carmakers in the taxpayer-funded coronavirus recovery package, and funding for fossil fuels.That report about hospital parking charges resuming for NHS staff appears to be causing unease in Tory ranks.Labour has been highly critical of the plan - a sign that it may be raised by Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions.Many of today’s papers lead on the chancellor’s jobs plan. But the I’s splash focuses on the end of free parking for NHS staff. And the  leads on the stamp duty holiday. Here are some of the other front pages:Welcome to live coverage of the UK’s coronavirus crisis and the chancellor’s summer statement. Rishi Sunak is set to put a job creation plan for under-25s at the centre of his statement, which is expected at about 12.30pm. The £2bn scheme will fund six-month job placements for an estimated 350,000 18- to 24-year-olds.Sunak is also reported to be considering a stamp duty holiday for properties under £500,000 to boost the housing market, as part of a package to tackle the economic impact of the coronavirus.Richard Partington has a preview of these and other measures to look out for in the chancellor’s statement.

Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen made a personal statement in the Dáil on Tuesday night. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMinister for Agriculture Barry Cowen has told the Dáil he is profoundly sorry for a drink-driving offence in 2016.He said his decision to drive while over the limit and on a provisional driving permit was a stupid mistake and he had apologised to road safety groups and campaigners.He said the drink driving offence on the way home from an All-Ireland football final on September 18th, 2016 was the one and only time he had driven while over the limit.“Before the match I consumed two drinks and following the game had a light meal before driving home to Offaly. On the way to drop my friend home I was stopped by gardaí and asked to participate in a breathalyser test. I did so, and both this test and a subsequent test at a local Garda station confirmed that I was over the legal alcohol limit,” he said.At the time he held a learner driver permit and the penalty was a €200 fine and a three month driving ban.“I subsequently secured and now hold a full clean driving licence,” he said.“My decision in September 2016 to drive home after consuming any alcohol was a stupid stupid mistake. It never happened before the 18th of September 2016 and it has never happened since. It was a mistake for which I am profoundly sorry,” he added.He had examined his records and the only other offence for which he had paid a fine that had not already been reported by media was for failing to display a tax disc while parked in Tullamore 14 years ago.Mr Cowen told the Dáil it was not uncommon to drive on a learner permit before reforms of the driver licensing system but it was bad practice and he should have regularised his position sooner.He said other offences including parking fines should not be conflated with the totally different issue of drink driving.AloneThe Minister who sat alone on the Government benches said in his personal statement to the House that the emergence of the issue had put an intense spotlight on him and on “more importantly, the shame of drink driving”.He said the criticism he had attracted for a serious lapse of judgment was fully deserved. “This grave error and my subsequent humiliation will hopefully serve to highlight the terrible dangers and consequences of drink driving.”Mr Cowen said he spoke earlier on Tuesday to Susan Gray of Parc road safety group and Donna Price of the Irish Road Safety Association and apologised to them. He said he had also apologised to his family, the Taoiseach, the Government, his constituents and the public.Mr Cowen referred to “some speculation about how someone my age could be driving on either a learner permit or provisional licence”.He said the fact is that before the recent reforms of the system it was “not uncommon for people of all ages and levels of experience to either be on a provisional or learner permit. However this was bad practice and I clearly should have regularised my position sooner.”He said that after a full examination of all his records “the only additional event that I have been able to identify, not reported this morning was a failure to display a tax disc while parked in Tullamore 14 years ago for which I paid a fine”.Mr Cowen said he would “now invest my full energy and full focus on the responsibilities I have been given as a TD and a Minister”.‘So disappointed’Susan Gray of Parc, said afterwards that Mr Cowen had left “so many unanswered” questions.She said he rang her on Tuesday morning and she put several questions to him. “He assured me he would answer as many as he could tonight during his statement. It just beggars belief that that man has ignored the huge elephant in the room here. Where he was driving on a learner permit for years and years, he has admitted he drove unaccompanied ... he was done for speeding, he took it to court ... we asked him did the penalty points get applied to his licence. We know that a learner driver after receiving seven penalty points is automatically disqualified,” she told RTÉ’s Prime Time.“We just can’t believe he didn’t answer any of them questions,” she added.She said she asked Mr Cowen on Tuesday morning when did he get his full licence. “He said a few years ago, he couldn’t give me the date. I told him it would be on his driving licence ... he didn’t have it on him”.She asked if he displayed N plates as a provisional permit holder. “There are so many unanswered questions that we will be issuing a statement tomorrow on what we decide is the best way forward,” she said.QuestionsEarlier an opposition attempt to force Mr Cowen to answer questions after his Dáil statement about his drink driving ban was defeated.Mr Cowen made his statement at 9pm on Tuesday.Labour and a number of Independent TDs supported Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Green Party in the 30 to 14 vote which prevented a change to the order of business.Rise TD Paul Murphy said it was not acceptable and “problematic” that Mr Cowen would give a statement without answering questions.The Dublin South-West TD said there were “numerous questions” outstanding about the offence, Mr Cowen’s licence and whether he was breaching the law repeatedly in relation to learner plates and being accompanied by a fully licensed driver.He added that it was the “first test of the Government and whether they’re going to establish a precedent” by using their majority to prevent questions to a Minster involved in controversy.Ceann Comhairle Sean O Fearghail said Mr Cowen had made a request for speaking time to make a personal statement under Standing Order 56 which did not allow for debate.Independent TD Mattie McGrath said no request had been made at the business committee about the issue and he accused Mr Murphy of “showboating and shenanigans”.‘Cute hoor’Taoiseach Micheál Martin rejected opposition suggestions that Fianna Fáil is back to “old style cute hoor kind of politics”.Labour leader Alan Kelly made the claim in the Dáil as he highlighted controversies that erupted in the party’s first week back in office.He raised the issue during Mr Martin’s first leaders’ questions in the Dáil as Taoiseach.But Mr Martin stressed that he had been focused on “policy and substance”. He said that “other stuff goes on as it always has in politics and we will deal with that too”.Mr Kelly said that Mr Martin had had the “shortest honeymoon in history” of just two hours before internal party criticism began.He told the Taoiseach: “One of your Ministers has had to apologise quite publicly for his driving ban while on a provisional licence,” in reference to controversy over Mr Cowen and the drink driving offence.Mr Kelly added that it was “in the same week your Minister for health has stood over an interview where he admitted taking illegal drugs.”And “then one of your MEPs ignored the requirement for quarantine” when he returned from Brussels to attend the Dáil sitting in the Convention Centre.The Tipperary TD asked: “Are Fianna Fail public representatives above the law and above public health advice?”He said the Government’s first week had not been a good week and “the modus operandi looks like it’s back to old style cute hoor kind of politics”.He also hit out at Sinn Féin’s leadership over the controversy about breaking social distancing rules attending two funerals in the North when other families stayed home when their own relatives and friends were buried.The practice of “exceptionalism” might be expected from Sinn Féin but many thought Fianna Fail had been “humbled” by the recession.He also criticised the first act of the Minister for Education which he said “was to bellow about a new grant to a school in her own constituency”, during the biggest education crisis to face the State.PunishmentThe country needed a stable Government during the biggest crisis to face the State and people were concerned about housing, health, rents, mortgage arrears and returning to work.Mr Martin however told Mr Kelly he rejected “your analysis of the first week in Government” and said his focus has been on “policy and substance”.He said there was an unprecedented amount of legislation they would try to get through in this Government and he had had talks with senior EU officials including the president of the European Commission and British prime minister Boris Johnson.The Taoiseach said “I haven’t wasted an hour” in dealing with policy.He said “no politicians should be above the law and no politician is above the law”.Mr Martin added that punishment “was meted out” to Mr Cowen and he would address the issue in a statement later in the Dáil on Tuesday night.He stressed the focus on education and not depriving children any longer of schooling and education. He said they would deal with travel and quarantines and they would focus on education and “engaging with the education authorities in terms of returning to school”, and on the return of health services."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4299070.1594196800!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eamon ryan missed chance to promote women says catherine martin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.

We should always be seeking to do that, to promote women.”The Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht said she congratulated all the male Ministers.“They’re all able for the job, but I think there was a missed opportunity to promote women and from our side there was also a missed opportunity to unite the party as well, that nobody who voted no or advocated no to the programme for Government was promoted to ministerial position and I think that was a missed opportunity to unite.“We are a party that respects and cherishes debate and challenge and having those voices inside and within government at the ministerial table would have been welcome.”When asked about an accusation of misogyny within the party by Cork Green Party councillor Lorna Bogue, Ms Martin said: “I think we have to be seen to do more — as a party we talk the talk in relation to promoting ersity and inclusivity, but if we’re not acting on it I think that’s regrettable and that’s something I would like to see changed.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4298750.1594160637!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1ilers saying sorry the soundtrack to government s early days","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew Taoiseach Micheál Martin. One of the advantages of Government is you get to control the agenda a lot of the time. A week and a half in office and Martin’s administration has yet to demonstrate it can do so. Photograph: Oireachtas TVOpposition leaders had their first chance to question the new Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Tuesday in the socially-distanced Leinster House, and those hoping for a clearer government-opposition split than typical in the muggy days of confidence-and-supply were disappointed.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald – first up as leader of the Opposition – ended up agreeing that she and Martin were “of one mind” on the issue of extending maternity benefits, differing only on the timing and urgency.Labour leader Alan Kelly had a go at Sinn Féin as much as Fianna Fáil.Richard Boyd-Barrett stood up for “working people”. Martin told him things were “not that simple”. Perhaps it would be unfair to call it a damp squib but it was a pretty tame affair.Nonetheless, Tuesday’s Dáil session contains two important signposts to the conduct of politics in the coming weeks and months.Firstly, Sinn Féin chose a low-key, bread and butter issue relating to the delivery of State services and payments – in this case the extension of maternity benefits – as its first question to the new Taoiseach.No high-flown rhetoric about “change”, no questioning the mandate of the Government or its legitimacy. Just small-bore stuff that affects people’s daily lives, likely to play well with the Facebook groups and social media audiences that the party targets relentlessly. Expect more of this.Martin replied that Ministers were in consultation on the issue. The Government wanted to do it, but do it in a “considered way”.Do the right thing, urged McDonald. Just do it.“It is not as simple as the deputy has outlined,” pleaded Martin.Welcome to Government.Order of businessThe second indication of future direction was when Rise TD Paul Murphy challenged the Dáil’s order of business, seeking that Fianna Fáil TD and new Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen should answer questions after his personal statement in the Dáil on Tuesday evening.Cowen was scheduled to make a statement on his 2016 ban for drink-driving, but Murphy wanted him to take questions afterwards – a practice that became routine in the last Dáil.However, that was only because the Government didn’t have a majority in the last Dáil, and was forced to submit to the will of the House on such matters.Now it does have a majority, and backed by that majority, its writ runs in the House. Pushed to a vote, Murphy lost. We will see more of this – the Government will use its power in the Dáil.It may have been a relief to the Government which is (nervously) backing the Minister, but the resumption of Dáil business comes after a pretty torrid first week for the new Taoiseach.The Opposition seems to have little enough appetite for going after Cowen, while his Government allies will – in the absence of any new, damning revelations (speeding fines and parking tickets do not qualify) – grumpily keep faith with their colleague.But combined with MEP Billy Kelleher’s admission that he violated quarantine rules to attend the election of the new Taoiseach, the frequency of apologies from Fianna Fáil politicians in recent days has been rather higher than ideal for Martin.Getting to gripsThere is lots going on in the background, Government insiders claim, with Ministers getting to grips with their departments and an intense legislative programme for the next few weeks underpinning special Covid supports and necessary for the big economic stimulus programme likely to be launched next week. There are highly-pressurised decisions on reopening required. But mostly the public have seen and heard Fianna Fáilers saying sorry.One of the advantages of Government is you get to control the agenda a lot of the time. A week and a half in office and Martin’s administration has yet to demonstrate it can do so."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4298742.1594158946!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord minister for agriculture tries to get himself out of the manure","story":"Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen has told the Dáil he is profoundly sorry for a drink-driving offence in 2016.

Photograph: PAIn an explosive debut, the new Dáil burst from the Leinster House blocks on Tuesday.The coalition’s first day in full session after Government formation brought with it the first abject apology from a Government Minister. That’s quite the start.And it came after a litany of embarrassing episodes for new Taoiseach Micheál Martin, busily concentrating on getting his administration up and running while his party colleagues busily concentrate on covering themselves in ignominy.Although his new Minister for Agriculture can’t be accused of not getting stuck in immediately. Barry Cowen is barely a wet week in his job and already he’s up to his oxters in manure. BabyBiff, brother of a former taoiseach Brian Cowen, was forced to make his inaugural statement to the Dáil in his new role all about himself.It was a deep, deep apology for a drink-driving offence committed four years ago (and saying nothing to his party leader about it) and getting a fine and a three-month ban. As it was at the lowest end of the scale, there was no requirement to go to court at the time.Full apologySo Cowen came into the chamber at 9pm and devoted his six-minute speaking slot to a full apology for his “grave error” and “lapse of judgment” and “stupid, stupid mistake”. There were no questions taken on his “misdemeanour”.While taking full responsibility for his one and only lapse into “the shame of drink-driving” and apologising all round him, he made no attempt to make excuses his action or minimise the gravity of the offence. But his carefully worded statement also referred to how reports on the original incident have now “extended to reporting various speeding and parking fines I have occurred over the years”.Many TDs would have collected similar penalties he intimated and he was clearly unhappy with these issues being “conflated” with the altogether different matter of drink-driving.“I have conducted a full examination of all records that I could obtain,” he informed the Dáil. After dredging though his motoring past he disclosed “a failure to display a tax disc while parked in Tullamore 14 years ago”.Cowen wants to get on with his job. “Now, formally, on the record of this House I sincerely want to apologise to my peers and my colleagues.”In the meantime, he has been very busy. Almost as busy as his boss who earlier told the House that he hasn’t “wasted an hour” since becoming Taoiseach.Cowen detailed all he has done since getting the new job in agriculture, before the premature onset of the manure. He has had made himself aware of the threat of Brexit, acquainted himself with the parlous state of the timber industry and already had the chats with commissioner Phil Hogan and his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Edwin Poots.You’d be worried letting Barry near a car after those conversations which would drive anyone to drink.A day when an attempt at a groundbreaking form of blended learning has entered its second week in Kildare Street. Early results are chaotic but largely inconclusive.It involves Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael running a government together for the first time, with a large handful of Greens thrown in for leavening purposes. Whatever way the experiment turns out, it’s shaping up to be very entertaining. Sorry, educational.How will they get on? Hard to credit, but Tuesday’s sitting was the first with all the bells and whistles since the general election was called back in February.It was a huge occasion for Martin, who turned up in the chamber almost 10 minutes early for his first round of Leaders’ Questions as Taoiseach. The Fianna Fáil leader had already waited 31 years so an extra few minutes to savour the moment wasn’t going to make much difference.Oh, but Micheál was anxious to get his posterior into that coveted top seat, making a swift beeline towards it as soon as he got through the doors. He swerved to take the shortest route, only to be deftly erted by ushers onto the time-honoured walkway all around the top level of the circular chamber, and from thence down the stairs which end where he sits.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, in her elevated capacity as leader of the biggest Opposition party, took up position across the floor in the place recently vacated by the new Taoiseach. She also arrived in good time for the Dáil’s daily set piece. A big day for her party too – a nice change.Social distancingCardboard political place-settings were placed at intervals around the benches, setting out precisely where the TDs had to sit to comply with the extremely strict social distancing rules. There were very real fears that Mary Lou and Pearse Doherty might – through no fault of their own – thoroughly orchestrate a regulation-busting Sinn Féin crowd scene in their section, but they didn’t because this was Dublin and not west Belfast.The names on the place-settings changed since the curtailed sessions of previous weeks, when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs were given separate numbered spots. Now that the 33rd Dáil is under way, those two parties names have been replaced with the generic “Government” tag.Not a day assembled as a coalition in the old chamber and already the big two have lost their identities.On the other side of the floor, it was a case of high hopes and earplugs with Mary Lou finally earning first dibs on questioning a Taoiseach during Leaders’ questions. This is the most high-profile event of the Dáil day (except when a politician has to come in and make a grovelling apology for a lapse in standards).Then we had Cowen hauling himself in from the doghouse to beg forgiveness.Under normal circumstances, with BabyBiff’s tribulations added to the litany of Government howlers marking the start of Martin’s government, a scorching debut might have been expected from the steely Sinn Féin leader. But it was a subdued start from Mary Lou, who stuck to the issue of extended maternity leave and pay for new mothers who are facing particular difficulties are a result of the Covid-19 crisis.She expressed her concerns during two polite exchanges with the Taoiseach, who was equally concerned and polite.Micheál adopted a markedly different tone throughout his first Leaders’ Question, as if emphasising he was listening to the opposition during his time supporting the Fine Gael government and is going to be far more responsive than Leo Varadkar.Bout of hostilitiesAt the end of the first bout of hostilities between the Fine Gael and Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou’s response reflected her soft approach to this particular episode.“In that case, we are of one mind,” she told Micheál.That won’t happen too often. But then, following the embarrassing events for Sinn Féin in Belfast, it was probably wiser not to go drawing attention to the provisional route about licences and the like.Labour’s Alan Kelly took up the slack. He had no qualms reintroducing both the Government and Sinn Féin to recent embarrassments.When the sting of the last few weeks wear off for the main opposition, the Sinn Féin leader and the Labour leader will make a formidable team. They’ll be trying to outdo each other in knocking spots off Micheál.The Taoiseach will have to on stay on his toes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4298678.1594157160!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach criticises sinn f%C3%A9in s over focus on border poll","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he would take a ‘pragmatic’ approach and seek to promote ‘practical’ co-operation between North and South. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTaoiseach Micheál Martin is to travel to Northern Ireland on Thursday to meet First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, as the new Government sets out to “rejuvenate” North-South relations, officials said.Mr Martin told The  he would take a “pragmatic” approach and seek to promote “practical” co-operation between North and South and would not be pushing the British government for a Border poll.He said there were “two different philosophies and two approaches at work – one is just have a Border poll and get a majority, but mine is much more rooted in the Good Friday Agreement ... a consensus approach”.Earlier, answering his first series of questions as Taoiseach in the Dáil, he told Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald: “I do not believe that precipitating or organising a referendum immediately is the way to go. That was the Sinn Féin position since Brexit happened, although it has come back a bit from that. ‘Consensus approach’“The over-focus on the Border poll was too isive and too partisan and ran counter to what Sinn Féin wanted to achieve. That is my view. I favour a different approach. For example, I favour a stronger North-South dimension now.”He said Ms McDonald wanted to adopt “a more territorial, majoritarian approach whereas I prefer to develop a more consensus approach”.In exchanges which made clear the ide between Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin on the issue, Ms McDonald said Brexit and coronavirus had “reshaped how people think and talk about reunification”. “Both of these crises have shown very dramatically the danger and jeopardy of the Border on our island. No longer is Irish unity discussed only in aspirational terms, it is now increasingly regarded as a common sense approach and essential to the prosperity of all of our people. “I say that because growing our green economy requires an all-Ireland approach. Protecting and building public health services and protecting public health itself requires an all-Ireland approach, as does strengthening our agricultural sector and defending rural Ireland. All of these things must be all-Ireland in nature,” she said.Ms McDonald was critical that the new “Shared Island” unit which has been set up in the Department of the Taoiseach will not be tasked with promoting constitutional change.“Will he establish an Oireachtas joint committee on Irish unity?” she asked. “Will he convene an all-island representative Citizens’ Assembly, or such an appropriate forum, to discuss and plan for constitutional change? Will he initiate the process for a referendum and get clarity on what the thresholds for triggering such a referendum might be?”Reconciliation Mr Martin said the Sinn Féin leader “has adopted a certain partisan approach to this issue”. “The agenda for the future on this island is how we engineer and develop an accommodation where we can all live in peace, harmony and reconciliation on the island and not to, at the outset, try to dictate to one tradition or one group what the solution is going to be, which seems to be the agenda the deputy is pursuing,” he said.Mr Martin has already spoken to Ms Foster and Ms O’Neill by phone, and officials have been working on setting up the meeting with the Stormont administration since he became Taoiseach more than a week ago. He told The  that he expected to discuss shared priorities on combatting the virus, including the potential use of the HSE’s coronavirus tracing app, some joint infrastructure projects, Brexit and other issues. He will also meet the leaders of the North’s other parties. Officials will also seek to arrange an autumn meeting of the North-South ministerial council, one of the bodies set up under the Belfast Agreement, the first since 2016.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"PM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Speculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294866.1593715662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the abrupt end to brexit talks is not only surprising but perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

The pandemic has been a torrid time for millions, who have faced huge financial shocks. “Having thousands of pounds tied up on what was once a dream, has turned into a nightmare. It’s left people in distress and some will have seen their mental health impacted. It is time for regulators and politicians to take action.”Jet2 and Jet2holidays were rated among the best firms with 87 per cent of customers with cancelled bookings saying they had received refunds. Travel has effectively been on hold since March when the Foreign Office issued a warning against all but essential overseas travel, followed by the 14-day quarantine for all UK arrivals introduced on June 8.Last week, the Government announced that 59 countries would be exempt from the quarantine from July 10.  Follow all the latest updates below. There are significant levels of consumer concern about the infection risk of flying, research suggests. A survey for the International Air Transport Association (Iata) in major airline markets, including the UK, Germany, France and the US, found three out of five respondents had avoided air travel and one-third would avoid flying in future to avoid catching the virus.All respondents had travelled by plane in the past 12 months.Some 65 per cent of consumers were concerned about ‘sitting next to someone who might be infected’,  two in five were concerned about ‘using toilets’, with 37 per cent fearful of ‘breathing the air on the plane’.The major concerns at airports were ‘being in a crowded bustrain to the aircraft’, ‘queuing at check-insecurityborder control or boarding’  and ‘using airport toilets’. The survey of 4,700 consumers in 11 countries was carried out in June. The poppies, daisies and cornflowers emerge annually alongside the lentil crop on the Umbrian plain of Castelluccio.

Certainly no-one I spoke to yesterday about the crippling effects of being put on the British red list was laughing.Jorge Beldade, Director of Operations at Minor Hotels in the Algarve, responsible for Europe’s first Anantara, told me: “Because of the disproportionately bad publicity this has brought us, due to a few, controlled, clusters far away in Lisbon, we have had an enormous amount of cancellations.” The hotel, whose occupancy is normally around 45 per cent British, is currently seeing three per cent of bookings from that market, and has been forced to postpone its re-opening from July 1 to July 20.At family-friendly Martinhal, with hotels in Cascais and the western Algarve, it is a similar story, although both properties are now open. “Cancellations have increased,” owner Chitra Stern explained, “and new enquiries have decreased. We are looking at an occupancy fluctuating between 10 per cent and 20 per cent right now with a huge drop in our strong British market. But the ones who have decided to come feel comfortable in their private pool villas and the outdoor activities, from surfing to hiking, that Portugal excels in.”Read the full story.Australia\u0027s second-largest city returning to lockdown with a stay-at-home order in effect for the next six weeks following a spike in coronavirus cases. Five million residents were ordered back into lockdown beginning midnight Wednesday into Thursday as soaring community transmission of the coronavirus brings more than 100 new cases daily.The border between Victoria and New South Wales, the country\u0027s two most populous states, was closed on Tuesday for the first time in 100 years as authorities attempt to contain an outbreak of the virus in Melbourne.Read our latest advice on when you can travel to Australia.New York City moved into the third phase of its easing of lockdown measures on Tuesday. Nail and tanning salons, tattoo parlours, spas and massages, dog runs and many other outdoor activities are allowed to resume under the third stage of the four-phase plan to reduce restrictions. The National Gallery reopens today, making it London\u0027s first major art museum to reopen its doors after closing in late March. Visitors will be asked to wear masks and social distancing and advance booking are mandatory. The gallery expects around a quarter of the usual number of visitors - or 3,000 to 4,000 people per day.Opening hours have been reduced from eight to five,  although on Friday they will be extended to 10 hours.We had two primary objectives, said the gallery\u0027s chief operating officer Paul Gray.

unsafe working conditions.The online fashion retailer has committed £10m towards “eradicating malpractice” among its suppliers after an investigation by The Sunday Times found that workers in a Leicester-based factory were making clothes destined for Boohoo for as little as £3.50 pounds an hour.The report also claimed that few measures had been put in place to prevent the potential spread of coronavirus among workers.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBoohoo, which owns brands including PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, said the review will be led by Alison Levitt QC.In a statement released on Wednesday, management said the board was “shocked and appalled by the recent allegations”, adding that it was “committed to doing everything in our power to rebuild the reputation of the textile manufacturing industry in Leicester”.Asos and Next remove Boohoo amid claims of exploitation by supplier“We take extremely seriously all allegations of malpractice, poor working conditions, and underpayment of workers,” the statement read.“The group will not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance with its code of conduct or any mistreatment of workers, and will not

The Met Office has predicted the hottest day of the year A dog jumps into the water as families relax at a Lido in LondonEarlier this year, Boohoo said it had begun a review of its garment-makers, including “a full audit of all of our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities”.But former MP Mary Creagh, who investigated the UK’s fast-fashion garment industry as chairwoman of the Commons’ environmental audit committee, said monitoring the sector was difficult.“When you think there are 10,000 workers, there are hundreds of factories and the tendency is when one factory is shut down it just springs up again in a sort of phoenix factory approach,” she told the BBC.“They are shut down by authorities on Friday and they start up in a different building with a different name on Monday morning and this is the problem. It is a really difficult issue to tackle, the problem is the system not just the enforcement.”Over the weekend, health secretary Matt Hancock said he was “very worried about the employment practices in some factories” in the city.“There are clearly some problems that have been under the radar in Leicester that need action,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year. However, Covid-19 has also further exacerbated existing geopolitical issues within South America, and this may well have caused an interesting spike in bitcoin trading activity.This trend is only further likely to continue, with many Latin American countries such as Venezuela, now adopting cryptocurrency to help alleviate the issues of hyperinflation.Venezuela actually saw a slight drop in bitcoin trading, however its already high volumes means it is now second only to Russia in terms of trading volume.The country\u0027s economy has been in free-fall for several years, made worse by crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UK and US.Bitcoin overtakes gold to become the best performing asset of 2020Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate hit 10 million per cent in 2019, prompting many people to turn to cryptocurrencies as a more stable medium of exchange.Since 1 June, 2020, an estimated 20,000 shops and businesses in the country now accept payments via bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.One-quarter of adults living with a long-term health condition have admitted they are afraid to leave the house as Covid-19 restrictions are loosened.Research polling 1,000 UK adults with a long-term health condition found one-fifth had not left their home since the lockdown was first introduced in mid-March, except for emergencies.More than half felt anxious about restrictions easing and 40 per cent were concerned about the cleanliness of other people.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe poll was commissioned by We Are Undefeatable, a campaign to help people in England who live with a long-term health condition to be as active as they can.It also emerged two-thirds of people living with a health issue said getting outdoors for physical activity is crucial for their mental health.Jack Thorne condemns of the term ‘underlying health condition’Dr Zoe Williams, practising NHS GP and resident doctor on This Morning, said: “It’s no surprise that people living with health conditions have concerns and feel anxious about how safe it is for them to get back to normal life.“This is to be expected, as we have been told that people with certain health conditions must stay at home and this is especially true for those in the shielding group.”A further poll of 2,000 adults found 50 per cent of the wider adult population had suffered with anxiety during the lockdown — compared to 55 per cent of those with underlying health conditions.Yet, they were twice as likely to feel happy about lockdown lifting than those with a health condition.It was also found that one-quarter of people living with a health condition did not intend to return to communal sport and leisure centres until there is a vaccine or Covid-19 is no longer a threat in the UK.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s as if the health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnother wrote: “Cycling through London tonight made me cry.

But none more so than the Tories. This is on them.”One man who passed through Soho told the Daily Mirror: “Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.”Police were present in the area, though it seems no attempts were made to disperse the crowds, which filled a number of streets closed off to cars.Large groups were also seen congregating in Notting Hill on Saturday night.The latest figures show the R rate range has risen above 1 in London – meaning cases of the virus could be growing again.In the capital, the range is thought to be between 0.8 and 1.1. Across the UK, the government says the estimated R number is between 0.7-0.9.On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned that “this virus is a long way from gone.Although ‘Super Saturday’ appears to have passed without any major incidents, there have been reports of disorder across the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Disturbance in Brentwood High street assisted other units. 4 people arrested. 2 of my team have arrested and are currently on the way to custody.”Earlier on Saturday, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said feedback from branches suggested up to half of pubs did not reopen on Saturday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Rishi Sunak is coming under intense pressure to extend furlough and self-employed support schemes in Wednesday’s emergency mini-budget, in the hope of staving off a threatened wave of job losses as the UK emerges from coronavirus.The chancellor’s hotly anticipated Covid-19 recovery plan will feature a £2bn “kickstart” fund to subsidise hundreds of thousands of work placements for the 16-24 year-old age group whose job prospects have been hit hardest by the pandemic, in what the Treasury described as “the biggest package of support for youth employment in decades”.But unions said it was no more than a “good first step” towards halting mass youth unemployment. And critics said it fell short of Boris Johnson’s promise of “the chance of an apprenticeship or in-work placement” for every young person, with participants potentially earning as little as £161 a week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the government had failed to “rise to the scale of the unemployment crisis” and should stem unnecessary job losses by tailoring the withdrawal of support to the needs of sectors which face long delays before returning to pre-crisis activity.Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in Bristol“However, the government are yet to rise to the scale of the unemployment crisis. The urgent priority right now is to prevent additional unnecessary unemployment in the first place by abandoning the government’s one-size-fits-all approach to the removal of the job retention and self-employed schemes. In addition, older people who become unemployed, and those living in particularly hard-hit areas, will also need tailored support.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThe Resolution Foundation think tank has said that £3-5bn should be spent on extending furlough payments beyond the planned end-date of 31 October for sectors which will return to normal most slowly, such as hospitality, retail and entertainment, as part of a £200bn stimulus package to shore up the post-Covid economy.And the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said Mr Sunak must do “whatever it takes” in the package due to be unveiled to the House of Commons at lunchtime on Wednesday to support jobs in order to avoid “permanent long-term damage to the economy”.Prematurely ending the furlough scheme – under which the state pays 80 per cent of monthly wages, up to a maximum of £2,500 – risks permanently higher unemployment and weaker productivity, with a potential loss of £50bn a year to GDP, said the think tank.The £60bn job retention scheme is currently due to be wound down from the start of August, with employers in all sectors having to pay a progressively larger share of furloughed staff’s wages until it ends in November.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailNiesr’s deputy director Garry Young said it would make “economic sense” for Sunak to announce it will continue until GDP returns to 2019 levels, warning: “Premature withdrawal of the measures could mean that the long-term adverse impact on the public finances ends up being worse than the cost of continued short-term support.”And the Scottish National Party said the furlough scheme should continue as long as each of the four UK nations requires it.Michael Kill of the Night-Time Industries Association said nightclubs and entertainment venues need continued bounce-back grants and furlough payments in full until the end of 2020 to avoid being “crippled” by Covid-19.“These businesses account for an annual revenue of over £66bn per year and 8 per cent of UK employment, so it would be incomprehensible if the furlough scheme ends too quickly for staff in our venues,” he warned. “Thousands will be plunged into unemployment.”Meanwhile, MPs supporting the pressure group ExcludedUK have written to Mr Sunak urging him to provide help for groups like freelancers, the newly self-employed, small company directors and those who started new jobs after mid-March, who have so far been denied support in the form of furloughs, grants or loans.Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone, who on Tuesday launched an all-party parliamentary group to back the estimated 3 million excluded from help, urged Mr Sunak to meet with them, saying: “It is simply unacceptable that many iniduals are ineligible for every kind of support, even universal credit, for entirely arbitrary reasons. The chancellor must stop burying his head in the sand.”The party’s acting leader Ed Davey said it was a “gross injustice” that many self-employed people were not covered.The Kickstart scheme will allow employers to offer young people at risk of long-term unemployment a six-month work placement, with the government funding 100 per cent of the national minimum wage for the first 25 hours a week – the equivalent of £161 for 18-20 year-olds and £205 for under-25s.The chancellor is also expected to announce a £111m investment to triple traineeships in 2020-21, an extra £32m for the national careers service and £17m of extra funding for sector-based work academy placements in 2020-21. “Young people bear the brunt of most economic crises, but they are at particular risk this time because they work in the sectors disproportionately hit by the pandemic,” said Mr Sunak.“We also know that youth unemployment has a long-term impact on jobs and wages and we don’t want to see that happen to this generation.”TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The chancellor has made a good first step. But we’ll be checking the small print to ensure every job provides proper training and a bridge to steady employment.  “Employers must do the right thing. They should work with unions to avoid job displacement, create good opportunities for all young workers and guarantee they are paid at least the real living wage.”  And CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn described the proposed scheme as “a much-needed down-payment in young people’s futures”.“Business and government must now work to deliver the kickstart scheme simply and at speed,” said Dame Carolyn. “There can be no time lost in preparing young people who are entering one of the toughest jobs markets we’ve seen in decades.”But Liberal Democrat leadership contender Layla Moran warned the scheme would prove “too little too late for many of the corona class of 2020”.“Boris Johnson pledged a month ago that every young person would be offered an apprenticeship,” said Ms Moran. “This announcement appears to fall far short of that promise.“Eighteen-year olds could be left being paid just £161 a week under this scheme, which in some parts of the country would barely cover rent and transport costs. We risk losing a generation who will never recover their earnings.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This shows a staggering lack of self-awareness.”The chancellor is expected to announce a jobs scheme for young people which will see the government cover the cost of 25 hours a week at the minimum wage – if employers offer a six-month work placement to those aged between 16 and 24 on universal credit.It would take 18-year-olds – who currently earn £6.45 an hour on the minimum wage – more than a week’s work to make £180 under the Treasury’s new scheme.Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner chimed in on the row, tweeting: “What on earth does a £180 quid coffee mug actually do apart from hopefully keeping your coffee hot?”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A circus performer from the Association of Circus Proprietors in Whitehall, London.

I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He wrote on Twitter: “The EU wants an agreement # and we are doing everything to succeed # but not at any price.#It came ahead of last night’s meal with chief Brexit negotiator David Frost.Michel Barnier was served fish at his first Brexit dinner in No last night # as our negotiator warned him the EUs demands are a load of pollocks.The Frenchman tucked into a fillet of halibut as he and David Frost picked the bones out of access to our waters.Barnier was served fish at his first Brexit dinner in No last night # as our negotiator warned him the EUs demands are a load of pollocks.The Frenchman tucked into a fillet of halibut as he and David Frost picked the bones out of access to our waters.Over a three-course meal the pair also enjoyed a grilled asparagus starter and summer fruits terrine for pudding.It came just after Mr Barnier revealed the bloc is ready to accept British plans that will give our boats a far greater share of catches.The decision to serve him fish is the latest in a line of food faux pas during the talks.In October  then Brexit Secretary David Davis ruffled feathers when he served the EUs chief negotiator a heavy beef Wellington lunch.A year later the Frenchman caused consternation by giving Mr Davis successor Dominic Raab scallops just as French and UK fishermen clashed in the Channel.Angela Merkel will not help the UK secure a trade deal, a comment piece in German newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine has claimed.The articles author Katrin Pribyl wrote: “Berlin as the EUs Achilles heel “It is a misperception that carries risks and has so far mostly disappointed Brexit optimists.“Neither the often cited German automaker jumped to the side of the British, nor did Chancellor Angela Merkel go against the  remaining EU countries.“In London, hopes are based not only on Merkels call to act pragmatically in negotiations, but also on the belief that the German government is determined to prevent an economically disorderly exit due to the export-oriented German economy.”Negotiations are due to continue this morning, with fishing expected to be one of the key points discussed.Documents released yesterday revealed Michel Barnier has indicated Brussels is willing to compromise.The EU chief negotiator told a House of Lords committee that there will be no trade agreement without a “balanced” agreement on fisheries.He said: “Is this balanced agreement the British position as it is  Certainly not.“Is it the European position as it is today  Clearly not. We have two entirely contradictory positions.“If we both dig our heels in on those positions, there will be no discussion or agreement on fisheries and therefore no agreement on trade. That is not what we want.”Lord Norman Lamont has said he is sure the EU will offer Britain a trade deal because the British have insisted there will be no further extension of the transition period.Speaking to Brexit Watch, Lord Lamont said: #Until recently, I thought the negotiations had gone quite badly.#By the word badly, I mean, the likelihood of an agreement was not high.#Personally, I would prefer an agreement to no deal.#But recently Ive detected, perhaps because the British have insisted there will be no extension of the transition period, theres a slight increase in the willingness of the EU to try to reach a deal.#I think the EU is keener now, it has been convinced that Britain is not going to ask for an extension to the extension.#It is anxious to reach a deal itself.#A political polling expert has said support for an independent Scotland is #not just a blip#.Mark Dfley said there is a pattern emerging supporting Scottish independence.He said that while support for Scottish independence rose after the Brexit vote, it did not last.However, he said that the results now were #much more signicant# and had been steadily growing for six to eight months.Mr Dfley said: #It seems thatthere was a choice to be in an independent Scotland that was within the EU, that would be preferable to being part of the UK but out of the EU.#Previous no voters, who voted to stay in the UK but also wanted to stay within the EU, are moving more to yes.#Of course it does go the other way # people who voted for an independent Scotland who also voted for Brexit, some would rather now be in the UK outside of Europe.

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem. But staying open “evenit puts lives at risk” is a cavalier and dangerous attitude.If you own a factory, it is your job to make sure your workers are safe.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many could be thrown on the “scrapheap” and those trying to build a new career will find it tougher than ever to get a foothold on the jobs ­ladder.The impact of unemployment will blight their future, as the knock-on effects — including hopelessness and alienation — will last a letime.The Government has a simple choice this week: Either invest now to ensure youngsters have the training and skills needed to meet the challenges ahead, or we will all pick up the pieces later.That means laying the ground for real apprenticeships and work ­experience, with proper jobs at the end of them. There should be more opportunity to continue learning, developing the knowledge and skills required to land a job or, better still, become a future entrepreneur.We should seize the opportunity to create new jobs in the regions by regenerating the North and the Midlands, including tackling climate change, housing and construction, and the added social care challenges of supporting an ageing population.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Chancellor should also work with business and the trade unions to recruit , employers willing to assist, by offering them incentives and subsidies, including help with National Insurance and pension contributions.Additionally, existing underspends and the Apprenticeship Levy, together with potential benefit payments, should be topped up to create a £billion fund to meet the challenge of a record ­million under-s predicted to be out of work by Christmas. This is not just a matter of hard-headed public policy.It is about the lives of every inidual and their chances of building a future for themselves, developing a family of their own and contributing to their community. It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple. The least educated and the most vulnerable will be the ones to lose out most.Thinking these things through ­carefully, being able to act decisively and learning from the past, while not living in it, is surely common sense.And by God, we need a great deal more of that right now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

or show no symptoms at all.It means that young people are actually at higher risk of spreading the virus to more vulnerable people, potentially without even realising.Some young people may also have underlying health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic asthma and hypertension, which put them in the at-risk group.But there have been a number of cases in which young people have ended up in hospital or even dying from Covid without having any health issues.Last month, a -day-old baby with no known underlying conditions became Britains youngest coronavirus victim.  The most recent figures from the Office for National Statisticstoday showed that deaths overall in the UK are below normal - and coronavirus fatalities have fallen to the lowest level since before lockdown.But experts warn that while these figures are great news, it doesnt mean the pandemic is over.New positive cases of Covid- had been decreasing as a result of lockdown but this has levelled off in the past few weeks with infections stalling.Deaths tend to lag behind infections as it can take up to two weeks for symptoms to show, experts say.Also, people might not get tested immediately which could lead to a more severe illness and result in hospital care, or ultimately death.Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor at George Washington University School of Medicine, told \" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"CNN: It takes about a week after someone becomes infected until they get sick enough to be hospitalised, and then often about a week after that until you start seeing deaths.Boris Johnson said the country had to meet five key tests before lockdown could be eased.These included making sure the rate of infection was decreasing to manageable levels.One of the ways this is tracked is by measuring the R rate - which refers to the average number of people that one infected person can pass the virus on to. If its above one, it will spread exponentially, infecting more and more people.With theR rate below the crucial value of one across the country, the Prime Minister was able to announce that the restrictions could ease further and on July  pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers were allowed to reopen.But some regions, such as the north east, are only just teetering under one, so officials are monitoring the situation carefully.There have also been localised outbreaks such as in Leicester, so the city has been forced back into lockdown to prevent the spread.The Government has warned that it wont hesitate to put other areas under tougher measures - forcing the economy to shutdown again -cases rise.While face masks arent guaranteed to stop someone from catching the virus, they can be helpful in preventing infected people from spreading it.They can stop viral particles from sneezes, coughs and even talking from being released.Currently, Brits have to wear a face mask or covering when using public transport or face being fined.Experts have also advised people to wear one when in places where its harder to socially distance, such as supermarkets.Its not compulsory but some experts are calling on the Government to make face coverings mandatory.Homemade masks wont offer the same level of protection as medical-grade ones, but it hasnt stopped DIY tutorials popping up online.One of the simplest ones involves using two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape - and you can even tape down some wire to stfen the mask,you have any.Finish by punching holes in each end and threading elastic through to fit around your ears.If you dont have elastic bands you could also use a hair tie.The president of the Royal Society Venki Ramakrishnan said other countries have managed to implement the use of face masks into their daily lives so there was no reason why the UK should not have implemented a more stringent policy.Meanwhile, new research by the Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemicsgroup said masks could reduce the risk of transmission and can also provide benefits to those who wear them.However, they need to be worn properly - intermittently putting them on and off increases the number of times you touch your face.For the general public, more effective methods of protecting yourself from infection include regularly washing your hands, not touching your face, disinfecting surfaces, and social distancing.Brits have been advised not to purchase surgical coverings due to a shortage or personal protective equipment for NHS workers.The Government has released guides on how to make coverings at home from old t-shirts.If you already have a mask then there is no harm in wearing it, but make sure your mask is sanitised and that your hands are clean when taking it off and putting it on. And wash your hands again after taking it off.Most people who catch coronavirus only show symptoms about five days after being infected - but it can take up to  days in some cases.One study, published in the Lancet, found that during the initial five days - where people reported feeling fine - is when the highest amount of viral shedding happens.This is when infectious particles from the virus spread from one person to another.Experts still dont know how many people are asymptomatic, which is why it is important to self-isolate for  daysyou have knowingly been exposed to the virus.Its also vital to quarantine evenyou dont have the key symptoms of a persistent cough or a fever.The Government recently added a loss of taste or smell to the list of signs that could suggest a mild form of Covid-.Less common symptoms may include myalgia , nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, soyou feel unwell always contact NHS .With widespread job losses, economic recession and being confined to our homes at the forefront of our mind, its easy to see why this theory crops up.But allowing everyone to become infected with coronavirus - to gain whats known as herd immunity - could have serious negative impacts.A team of scientists at Imperial College London modelled what this would look like in the UK and predicted that it could lead to a quarter of a million deaths that would completely overwhelm the NHS for months.It would also prevent people from accessing healthcare, emergency services and even prescriptions for normal medical reasons, while doctors and nurses are off sick.People could begin dying from minor conditions such as asthma attacks, heart attacks, pregnancy complications, everyday accidents, bacterial infections and more.Experts from \" href\"https:www.kcl.ac.uk blog-the-ten-most-dangerous-coronavirus-myths-debunked-\" target\"_blank\" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"Kings College London say that instead of this scenario, governments are aiming to eventually achieve widespread immunity with vaccination - when one becomes available. This way a large part of the population will become immunised in a controlled manner, drastically minimising the devastating potential of the virus.While flu cases decline over the summer, experts dont yet knowthis is what will happen with Covid-.The warmer weather can help as people can spend more time outdoors, where its easier to socially distance.Thats why doctors are concerned about a second wave this winter.But as its a brand new virus, humans havent developed a level of immunity yet, so evenit is seasonal, prevalence may continue to increase as it infects more of the population.Coronavirus spreads via droplets from coughs and sneezes, but you dont necessarily have to be close to the infected person to catch it.It can easily live on a range of surfaces for several days.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.In fact, the US Centres for Disease Control and Preventiondiscovered that Covid- survived on surfaces for  days - after infected passengers disembarked from a cruise ship.So disinfecting surfaces and washing your hands regularly is so vital to stop the spread.An alcohol-based disinfectant is enough to kill the virus on surfaces.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We used that for several months before I connected with Leo Trottier, who is a cognitive scientist.He was looking for beta testers of a new device and that is the board we are currently using with Bunny.In another video posted to TikTok, Devine acknowledged that its dficult to say for sureBunny actually knows what she is communicating.I am not a scientist but I recognize that large amounts of data need to be collected before we can make a judgment as to whether or not Bunny actually understands what shes saying, she said.Im also aware that I inevitably skew the data in favor of saying that Bunny is consciously communicating with me.Either way, she said, its a fun and exciting experiment to try out with the beloved family pup.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Chancellor posed for photos alongside a £ bluetooth mug tonight, as he pretended to put the finishing touches on tomorrow’s ‘mini budget’. In the speech, he’s expected to announce a ‘kickstart’ scheme to boost jobs for young people. Under the scheme, employers offer a six-month work placement for young people - and the government pays  hours a week of the minimum wage for each one.

The country stands on the brink of a devastating recession that would bring with it unemployment, poverty and despair. If we are to avoid that fate, the Chancellor must come up with an ambitious rescue package that works for the whole country. The promise of support to help young people find work is a welcome step. So too is the extra investment in the green economy. But there is an urgent need for action for those who stand to lose their jobs as the furlough scheme is wound down. Many of these jobs could be savedthe Chancellor kept the Job Retention Scheme for the sectors worst affected by Covid-, such as aviation, retail and hospitality. He should also use this opportunity to raise wages for our heroic key workers. And there must be more to help our high streets as they emerge from the lockdown. The Government was too slow to respond to the medical crisis. It must not make the same mistake with the economic emergency. If Mr Sunak fails to rise to the challenge, the price will be another generation blighted by unemployment and deprivation. Ban fur cruelty  There are not many industries more abhorrent than the fur trade. Fur farming has been banned in the UK since  but almost £million worth of pelts are still imported each year.

But is he really in a position to do that  The speech at .pm today - dubbed a aposmini Budgetapos - isnapost an official aposfiscal eventapos. Itaposs not a Budget or a spring or autumn statement, where the chancellor would usually make sweeping changes to tax and spending measures. But the statement is expected to include a number of boosts for the economy, in a bid to prevent hundreds of thousands of job losses as the governmentaposs furlough scheme comes to an end. Hereaposs whataposs rumoured or confirmed to be in the chancelloraposs aposmini-budgetapos    Government-funded minimum wage jobs for young people The package includes £billion to subsidise thousands of six-month work placements for  to -year-olds who are now facing long-term unemployment. Under the “kick-start” scheme,  to -year-olds on Universal Credit will be eligible for six-month placements with the state covering % of the minimum wage for  hours a week. Bosses, who can top up wages, get a £, admin fee. The Resolution Foundation said the scheme could help up to , young into work – but must be delivered quickly. Paul Johnson of the IFS think tank said: “There are risks of course that you will take on a  year old, and  and  year olds who you might otherwise have taken on might suffer “You might be creating jobs that are’t really jobs, pushing other people out of work. “But I think as a response to what looks like a big increase of youth unemployment this is the sort of scheme you would have expected to be put in place.”   A bonus for companies who employ trainees More than £ million is to be invested in traineeships for - year olds in response to the coronavirus crisis. Businesses offering new traineeships in England will receive a £, bonus per trainee under the £ million scheme.  A aposGreen Homes schemeapos that could help you pay for upgrades Home owners will get £billion of vouchers to insulate homes as part of Chancellor Rishi Sunak ’s plans to create more than , green jobs. Hundreds of thousands of households will get grants of up to £, to make their homes more environmentally friendly. Vouchers worth up to £, will be available to some of the poorest families. The Green Homes Grant scheme — which will provide extra work for plumbers, builders and tradesmen and help the Covid-hit economy recover — will be announced in Wednesdayaposs mini budget. Homeowners will be able to spend the cash on loft, wall and floor insulation, eco-friendly boilers, heat pumps, double or triple-glazed ­windows, low-energy lighting and energy-efficient doors. The scheme will go live in September and, according to Treasury estimates, will save families up to £ a year on energy bills.  Green jobs in construction, engineering and design Some £bn will be spent on aposgreening upapos public buildings including schools, hospitals and social housing. And thereaposll be a £million pilot scheme to retrofit social housing with heat pumps, insulation and double glazing, to make them more environmentally friendly. Homes are currently responsible for around a fth of the UK’s total CO emissions. Rumoured policies A massive cut in stamp duty Most house buyers will be exempted from paying stamp duty for six months, it has been reported. The property tax threshold could be increased to as high as £, in a bid to exempt most homebuyers from paying any stamp duty and kickstart the economy. Currently the tax is charged on property purchases worth more than £, . Such a cut will save a family upgrading to a £, home a whopping £, in Stamp Duty, and take many homes out of the tax altogether temporarily.

Health officials have warned aposlocal lockdownsapos will be required going forward as the country learns to adapt to outbreaks of Covid- on a more regional level. One lockdown is ongoing in Leicester after a sharp increase in positive tests. The number of cases being found in Leicester was the highest in the country per ,, going from  to  cases in seven days to June . This was when Leicester went into lockdown with an infection rate three times higher than the next highest local area. But in good news today Health Secretary Matt Hancock, asked directly about Leicester, said the seven-day infection rate in the city has fallen to  per , people. He said the development underlined the importance of the dficult but vital decision to impose a lockdown. The Merseyside borough of Knowsley saw the sharpest increase in cases, from six to  per , in the seven days to June . Six areas have seen the infection rate per , increase over the week to June , according to the statistics. AREAS WHERE CORONAVIRUS RATES ARE STILL GOING UPMerthyr Tydfil has increased from . cases per , to . Knowsley has increased from . cases per , to . Bolton has increased from . cases per , to . Sheffield has increased from . cases per , to . Doncaster has increased from . cases per , to . Blackpool has increased from . cases per , to .The huge rise at Merthyr Tydfil, which takes it beyond Leicester, has been attributed to a cluster of  positive cases at Kepakaposs St Merryn meat plant.  Public Health Wales has said the surge in cases stems from increased testing with most of the positive cases uncovered on the same day. Factory floors are coming into sharp focus as having the potential for rapid cluster outbreaks with garment factories in Leicester also linked to a sharp increase in cases. On July  Bolton’s director of public health, Dr Helen Lowey, said: “The current situation in Bolton is very dferent to that in Leicester.The number of cases being confirmed in Bolton has been in decline over the past two weeks. “We will continue to closely review the data for Bolton and advise any measures that become necessary. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth - a Leicester MP - asked what would trigger the lting of the lockdown in the city. He said: What is the exit strategy for Leicester  How does an area that has gone into a local lockdown escape from a local lockdown  Mr Ashworth said in Germany, lockdowns were lted when cases got down to  per , people. Mr Hancock said  days of data were needed and the next steps would be announced on July .He would not give a specic figure for lting the lockdown because both the level and the rate of change matters. If the level were lower but it was going up, that could be a worse situation than a higher level that is under control and falling, he added. The statistics do show some good news with areas that had previously been a concern showing a fall in cases per ,, indicating it is likely the key aposRapos rate in the area is below one. AREAS WHERE CORONAVIRUS RATES HAVE SHARPLY FALLENBradford where cases have decreased from . per , to . Gwynedd where cases have gone down from . per , to . Wrexham where cases have plunged from . per , to . In Barnsley cases have dropped from . per , to .The drop in Wrexham is supporting the belief held by Public Health Wales that an outbreak at a meat factory in the area has not widely spread into the community.

Adam Gray, , York, North Yorks., had begun suffering from abdominal pains on hisfrom honeymoon in South Africa with pregnant we Christine and went to see a doctor. Days later he was given the devastating news he had a rare form of cancer, dubbed a silent killer due to the lack of early symptoms. Adam said his perfect le had been turned upside down in the space of  hours in July . The family are now raising funds to get specialist treatment in Germany which could further prolong his le, as well as fund crucial research in search of a cure.Adam, originally from York, North Yorks., told the Daily Record: We were about to welcome our first daughter into the world. I just got a new job in London and I felt great.Then it felt like my world just came crashing down out of nowhere. The lawyer - who would cycle nine miles to work every day and played football on weekends - admitted he never once thought he could get so ill.  Doctors had nearly sent the fitness mad dad home but following some tests and an ultrasound they discovered the cancer had spread through his pancreas, liver, lungs and lymph nodes. Pancreatic cancers are incredibly hard to identy during the early stages, with Adamaposs endocrine tumours spreading aggressively for at least two years. By the time he felt anything was wrong, it was already too late. The London-based lawyer said: The first year prospects were not good.  Adam spent  and a half months on chemotherapy where he underwent  cycles but the tumours kept growing - and ballooned to over cm by cm. He couldnapost sleep for days and weeks due to the chemotherapy and was left in excruciating pain as he took on the aggressive cancer. But he said witnessing the birth of his daughter was the happiest moment of his le.  He said: I was on chemo at that point and I was feeling awful. Just in pain all the time and being sick. But my daughter Amelie was born and it was the best day of my le. Adam and his we and newborn have been shielding since lockdown and keeping spirits up by enjoying each day together.

Del Roberts, , said his cross-breed mongrel Dutch was ripped to shreds before he could be freed with the help of two soldiers from a nearby barracks. The injured dog then fled and ran a mile home alone, despite the horric injuries. Mental health nurse Mr Roberts was walking his dog at around am on Saturday on a literally deserted field in Bootle, Merseyside, when the incident took place.He told the Liverpool Echo the two hunting dogs then appeared without collars or leads along with a man who warned him they play a bit heavy.When I got to the very far end of the field, out from behind a hedge came two lurchers and a guy with them. Mr Roberts said Dutch and the two Lurchers snfed each other for no more than  seconds, but as his dog turned away the Lurchers switched and became aggressive. He said: One of them bit his neck and then the other came over and the pair of them just ripped him to shreds.  My dog was screaming. I have never ever heard a noise like it, it was between a howl and a bark. Mr Roberts said the Lurchers did not have collars, and due to the rain it was extremely dficult to pull them off his terried dog. They were finally able to free Dutch, described as a happy, friendly dog, when the two soldiers from the nearby Territorial Army barracks joined the struggle.

Married Sarah Dowson persuaded the then--year-old that during their sex trysts he had made her pregnant. She was only caught out when police spent £, investigating her fraud and unearthed  baby scans she had bought on the internet. She had had sex with the teenager in woodland and fields after falling for him while celebrating his birthday. Jailing the -year-old mother, a judge told her: This was a mendacious course perpetrated against a young man  years your junior, who did not want to continue to have a sexual relationship with you. Your conduct was deliberate and vengeful, designed to cause trouble for your victim. At Reading Crown Court, Dowson admitted three counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud. Her husband Thomas Dowson admitted one count of perverting the course of justice. He received a suspended sentence. The court heard that when the teenager told Dowson that he wanted to end their affair, she told him she had become pregnant. She started bombarding his mother with requests for child maintenance payments, after brandishing the baby scan photos. When the teenageraposs family went to the police to complain about harassment, Dowson lodged a malicious allegation that the teen had raped her. She then further lied about him showing up at her home and sending her malicious messages, lies which were backed up by her husband, who believed the rape claim. Judge Morris heard that the lies by Dowson started to unravel when police found the results of a DNA test, which she had hidden from the teenager and his family and which proved it was her husband who was the father all along. The teenager had to wrongly tell his parents he had fathered a child, leading to a three-and-a-half year period where his family looked after the baby boy ashe were their own, the court heard. Prosecutor Simon Jones told the court that Dowson started sending sexual messages to the teenager. She had sex with him in a wooded area after they went out to celebrate his th birthday, the judge was told.  A few weeks after this, Mrs Dowson contacted [the teen] to say she was pregnant and it was his baby. [The teen] was not happy about that and he made no secret of the fact that he wanted Mrs Dowson to have a termination, said Mr Jones. However, the prosecutor said police had discovered messages between Dowson and her husband which suggested she had not been pregnant at all and had actually been having a heavy period. Despite that, Dowson sent her victim several thousand messages over  days, at a rate of four messages per day, until she threatened suicidehe did not impregnate her, at which point he relented and they had sex four or five more times, the prosecution said. Dowson became pregnant and gave birth to a baby on November , but she was supported through her full-term by the mother of the teenager, who thought it was her grandchild. The teenaposs mum had received fake scan images from Dowson which the prosecution said had been purchased from a retailer on eBay, which allowed purchasers to add customised details such as the date of the scan, the motheraposs name and details which would be consistent with how far along the person would be. It later emerged Dowson had sent a doctored image, a DNA test result she had changed to make it say the teen was the father of her child, to the child maintenance service to try and fraudulently obtain payments from him. Police had called Dowson into Basingstoke police station for a voluntary interview in respect of the harassment claim on February  , the judge heard. Mr Jones said: The next morning, she emailed Hampshire Constabulary and alleged [the teen] raped her two years ago. Following the allegation, the teen was arrested and kept in police custody for  and a half hours for questioning. He was further interviewed under caution four times when Dowson later alleged he had been harassing her.

During the chat Harry, who is president of the QCT, said thereaposs no way the Commonwealth of  nations could progress without first coming to terms with its past and human rights legacy. He said: Certainly, when you look across the Commonwealth there is no way that we can move forward unless we acknowledge the past. And I think so many people have done such an amazing, incredible job of acknowledging the past and trying to right those wrongs. But I think we all acknowledge, on here, that there is so much more still to do.  Itaposs not going to be easy and in some cases itaposs not going to be comfortable but it needs to be done because guess what  Everybody benefits. Meghan continued: We have to, in this moment in time, say aposweaposre going to have to be a little uncomfortable right nowapos because itaposs only in pushing through that discomfort that we get to the other side of this and find the place, as youaposre pointing out, where a high tide raises all ships. Mr Neilaposs barbed comments sparked a debate with some coming to the princeaposs defence. One chimed: Are they allowed to have opinions ! Another said: Thereaposs nothing controversial in the princeaposs comments here. He and Meghan are using their public profile and connection to the British State to raise awareness and prod for change. But others agreed with Mr Neilaposs assessment and went on to accuse Harry of undermining the interests of the UK. The discussion about the Commonwealthaposs colonial history and hand in the slave trade is a subject close to Harry and Meghan. It is all the more topical given the wave of mass discontent sweeping the global about racial inequality following the death of George Lloyd at the hands of US cops. Meghan also spoke about how they had to make the time and “found it a huge honour” to speak to global leaders. Last month Harry warned the world about the issue of unconscious bias which leads to people unknowingly practising racist behaviour.

Hormone pregnancy tests linked to miscarriages and disabilities in babies should have been axed  years sooner, a review has concluded. A  report found a possible link with spina bida but the tests, including the brand Primodos, were not fully withdrawn until . It is still not known how many women used them – but the Association For Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests estimates it was around . million. In addition to spina bida, the tests are linked with limb defects, congenital heart defects and developmental and learning problems. Jo Moreno was  when she told her GP she thought she was pregnant and was given Primodos. When she had baby Nicola, her daughter had the liver of a man who had drunk rum for  years. Nicola died in  after suffering organ failure shortly after her first birthday. Jo said: The last time I nursed her I knew how ill she was and the nurse prized her from my hands as she was screaming ‘Mummy’. I could still hear her screaming that in my nightmares for decades. Jo, , from Devon, said: We orced because we couldn’t cope. He blamed me and the doctors blamed me. I felt a failure as a woman. The Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review found opportunities were missed in axing them, meaning women were exposed unnecessarily to a potential risk. Baroness Julia Cumberlege, who led the review, concluded: It is our view that from , hormone pregnancy tests should no longer have been available. We are of the view their use should have been stopped in  due to the suggestion of increased risk. Marie Lyon, chair of the Association For Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests, said: I am overwhelmed that after a -year battle, Baroness Cumberlege and her team concluded the first substantive scientic report on Primodos in  was sufficient to justy withdrawal of Primodos and other HPTs from the market. In the s and early s, the NHS provided pregnancy tests – but only for women with a pressing medical need for a diagnosis. HPTs were used from  and contained synthetic versions of the hormones progesterone and estrogen.  Combinations of them are used daily by millions of women for contraception, as the pill. But campaigners said Primodos tablets were  times as strong as the pill. Charlotte Fensome, whose brother Steven has severe epilepsy, said: Every victim of Primodos is a personal tragedy. My mother was given Primodos and my brother was born with severe brain damage. It affects the whole family every day. A Bayer spokesman said: Bayer sympathises with people who struggle day to day as a result of physical disabilities.

And as scientists rush to develop one in record time to defeat the virus, surely we all wish it will arrive sooner rather than later. But that is far from the case. A YouGov poll for the Center for Countering Digital Hate, found almost a third of Brits might refuse to take a vaccine against Covid-. Of,  respondents, % said they would definitely not get vaccinated, while % said they would “probably not”. Another % said they weren’t certain. The survey has alarmed scientists, who knowa large numbers aren’t vaccinated, the virus will continue to spread. But it also shows how our modern world can facilitate the spread of lies and misinformation. So called anti-vaxxers, a small but vocal group who don’t believe in vaccinations of any kind, have long tried to push their views into the mainstream, often using social media networks to spread fear. Last year  scare stories about childhood vaccines were blamed for the UK registering more than  cases of measles, just three years after the World Health Organisation declared the country measles-free. And now anti-vaxxers appear to have taken advantage of heightened anxieties during the pandemic to disseminate fake news and conspiracy theories. And with people increasingly reliant on social media as sources of information, many  claims about Covid- took hold. According the CCDH, since the start of the pandemic .million more people in the US and UK have followed anti-vaccine pages and channels on social media. One video, entitled Plandemic, which claims the Covid- crisis was a Government set-up, has been viewed millions of times. Another post, claiming vaccines contain the same toxic chemicals as the substances used for lethal injections, warned: “The same chemical that is used to stop the heart of inmates on DEATH ROW is also in these vaccines.”  And in April the Government was forced to deny claims circulating widely online that the first volunteer in a human trial of a UK coronavirus vaccine had died. The stories about Elisa Granato were shared by several websites purporting to be news outfits. She updated her Twitter profile to explain she was “% alive”.Other posts doing the rounds claimed the vaccine would inject you with an electronic chip, allegations that billionaires like Bill Gates were making us ill for profit. Other pseudoscientic studies claim vaccines will put children in grave danger. The terrying result is that more and more people are turning against the very thing in they should put their hopes in. During protests in major cities against lockdown, many held placards decrying a vaccine, and even high-profile “influencers” and celebs have expressed concerns.In a Facebook live session, tennis player Novak Djokovic said: “I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel.”Singer MIA tweeted “If I have to choose the vaccine or chip I’m gonna choose death.” The experts say anti-vaxxers are playing with people’s lives. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director of the World Health Organisation, said: “At WHO, we’re not just battling the virus we’re also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response.” Mike Tildesley, an expert in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases and one of the Government’s SAGE group, believes lies propagated by anti-vaxxers could jeopardise the UK’s chance of eradicating coronavirus. He said: “A coronavirus vaccine can be used to achieve herd immunity. At least %will need to be immune in order for it to be achieved. “Therefore it is crucial as many as possible get vaccinated once a viable, safe vaccine is available.” So why are people giving more credence to anti-vaxxer posts  Dr Charles Kriel, a special advisor to the DCMS select committee on fake news says: “In a social media environment people tend to believe their friends and family more than institutional sources for information. “We’ve spent the last  years in the West critiquing our own institutions to the point where we’ve brought trust down, and social media makes this worse.” He also pointed to “malicious actors who are trying to amply these messages, because they add to the destabilisation of society. “We know that Putin and the Kremlin’s online operations to increase ision throughout society have increased considerably during the coronavirus. “Discouraging people from vaccinations, getting people to distrust their institutions and governments weakens us, which only strengthens them.” Gianfranco Polizzi, researcher at the LSE’s Department of Media and Communications, agrees, saying we must combat the anti-vax movement.

She told BBC Radio aposs World At One programme: The main thing that was going through our heads was we had to make sure everyone was safe, that we contacted everyone of our customers.

The detective who spearheaded the biggest manhunt in UK criminal history had just come face to face with the traffic officer in hospital shortly after the shootings. In more than  years of service, Neil, now , had worked on many murder inquiries. But nothing prepared him for the sight of PC Rathband in hospital, his face swollen, peppered with gunshot wounds suffered at point-blank range in his patrol car. Moat was still on the loose and had just threatened police, saying: “I’ve just downed one of your officers. I’m not going to stop.” Neil, head of Northumbria Police CID, found himself at the centre of the most ­challenging investigation of his le, recalling: “It was like being hit with a tsunami.” But he knew David, and it is the memory of those devastating injuries – and his colleague’s bravery – which stays with him. “I went with the Chief Constable to visit David in hospital,” he said in an interview to mark the th anniversary of the manhunt. “He was in a terrible state. Sitting up in a chair at the side of his bed, his face was severely swollen and peppered with gunshot. “He was rational, sensible, brave. He asked us to catch Raoul Moat. It was a tearful, moving experience, one I shall never forget.” Neil led daily press conferences giving the latest on the search in the early days of -hour news, facing probing questions live in front of millions of viewers. Neil and I have known each since our school days. We were born and brought up in Beacon Lough, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. In later years, we went on holidays together with friends. So it was bizarre to be in the packed press conferences with Neil, a detective chief superintendent, watching him face the world’s media, and asking him questions in briefings.His experiences feature in ITV’s Manhunt: The Raoul Moat Story. Memories of the most stressful eight days of his le came flooding back during filming. It all began in the early hours of July , , with the cold-blooded murder of Chris Brown, . The karate instructor was seeing Moat’s former girlfriend Sam Stobbart, , who he also shot and wounded.  Moat, , had just been freed from prison for assaulting a child and Sam had ended their relationship – saying she was going out with a police officer in an effort to get Moat out of her le. But he was intent on bloody revenge and made for her home, sitting beneath a window, listening to her talking to Chris. “Moat was there for more than an hour,” recalls Neil. “He was texting his accomplice Karl Ness parked up nearby. Knowing Moat as she did, Sam expected a fight. “Chris actually came out of the house with a metal bar in his hand, not for one moment expecting Moat to be right outside. It was a cowardly attack, Moat shooting him twice in the back as he walked out of the house. “He shot him a third time from close range in the back of the head after he fell.” Moat had added small weights to the shotgun cartridges to cause maximum injury.After the murder of Chris, described by Neil as the tragedy’s “forgotten victim”, Moat calmly walked up to the window where Sam was phoning police, shot her in the stomach, then ran. Ness was parked nearby but, on hearing the shots, drove off, leaving Moat.  Moat later met up with Ness and another accomplice Qhuram Awan. All three travelled around the area in Awan’s black Lexus. Chris, who was not a police officer, had been caught up in Moat’s insane jealousy. Before shooting PC Rathband, Moat used a pay-as-you-go phone to call the police and say that he was “hunting for officers now”. “He parked on a slip road out of sight of PC Rathband,” said Neil. “He sneaked up and shot David twice in the face, jumped back in the Lexus and took off into Northumberland, leaving David in agony, saying ‘I’ve been shot’ as he cried out for help on the radio. A short while later Moat again called the police callously boasting of his actions.” An unprecedented police operation followed, as Moat had the “means, capability and obvious intention” of killing officers. Neil had the task of finding him. “At that stage, the threat was against police, not the public” he said. Firearms officers from across the UK were called, with experts, psychologists and even TV survival expert Ray Mears. When Awan and Ness were caught on Tuesday July , Moat ran off near Rothbury, Northumberland – a county with nearly , sq miles of wilderness.  “The operation’s scale was huge,” Neil recalled. “Then Home Secretary Theresa May wanted updates. People underestimated the vast search area. I’m sure some thought ‘he is only hiding in some bushes, why can’t they find him ’ Moat made signicant efforts to hide.“Psychological advice was important. We had to be ready to confront him and were thinking ahead, deploying negotiators. Their advice was that unless he was specially trained in living without resources in the wild, the strain would play on him and he would come out. That is exactly what happened. He lasted until the Friday.” At one stage, two bounty hunters from Sunderland were arrested. An armed operation was also carried out after helicopters picked up infrared of a body in a field. It was a sleeping drunk.  “We had  alleged sightings that week,” said Neil, a dad-of-two now retired after  years’ service. “There were reports from people who believed they had walked past Moat in Rothbury. Whether that’s true I don’t know – what we know now is we were right to stick with that search area.” I spoke with Neil at the end of those long days to offer support. “It was really hard,” he says. “I had my we worried about me being on telly with a gunman on the loose. She said ‘whathe comes after you ’ We had reports claiming he was seen in Newcastle, Berwick and even Spain. “Some people told us their sheds had been broken into and ‘they were sure it was Moat’. The pressures of the day-to-day press conference built so much. The public and media started to doubtMoat was in Rothbury, as our searching was proving fruitless. We had to hold our nerve.” Two factors underpinned the operation, which involved hundreds of officers, army personnel and search experts. There were no confirmed sightings of Moat and covert intelligence suggested he had not left the area after Awan and Ness – later jailed for a minimum of  years and  years respectively – were arrested in a swoop by armed officers. “Pressure from the media really built up,” said Neil. “But despite wanting to, I could not explain our covert intelligence.” It ended with a call on the evening of July . A colleague said: ‘‘‘Boss, we’ve got him’. My first question was, ‘is it definitely him ’” said Neil. “They replied, ‘yes – he’s in a standoff with armed officers’. My second was, ‘where is he ’ My relief was huge when they said ‘Rothbury’.” A resident – who later got a £, reward – calmly called to say: “The man you are looking for is at the bottom of the road.” Armed police moved in. “The people of Rothbury were incredibly supportive,” added Neil. Memorably, footballer Paul Gascoigne turned up with a cooked chicken and fishing rod, to try and persuade Moat to hand himself in – but was asked to leave by officers. A Taser was used to try and avert Moat’s suicide and its inventor, Peter Boatman, later took his le after it emerged the firm supplied them to police while they were still being tested.

A study of over s found those taking them were % less likely to die from any cause and suggests more Brits should take them. The once a day pills also slashed the risk of succumbing to a heart attack or stroke by a fth. US researchers looked at data on over , US veterans between  and  who were at least  and had not previously had a heart attack or stroke. They identied more than , who began taking statins during this time and found a signicant link with reduced deaths. The benefits even applied to iniduals in their s and those with dementia. It adds to evidence that thousands of deaths could be prevented every yearmore elderly people were prescribed them. Lead author Dr Ariela Orkaby, of Brigham and Womens Hospital, Boston, said: “Based on these data, age is not a reason to not prescribe statins. “Statins are commonly studied and prescribed for middle-aged adults but understudied in people over age . “One of the most remarkable things about our results is we found the benefit of statins held true regardless of whether a person was older or younger or had a condition such as dementia.”  The drugs are taken by more than six million Britons but only around a third of . million over s. They lower levels of ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol - preventing blood clots which can lead to heart attacks or strokes. It is known they protect against heart attacks, strokes and death in the middle-aged. But in  major clinical trials, only % of participants have been  or older.

The Dogs Trust said people should be aware of the risks of buying dogs via online adverts. The charity said demand for puppies has spiked during lockdown and it has rescued dozens of smuggled pups worth tens of thousands of pounds that were destined to be sold on to unsuspecting UK buyers. In the latest pup-smuggling bust, six young dogs were found covered in sticky oil in the back of a van at Dover port. The charity has also saved  heavily pregnant mothers, who have given birth to  puppies worth around an additional £, to cruel smugglers. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. They had been illegally imported from Romania - underage and after a journey that would have taken more than  hours - despite the coronavirus lockdown restrictions in the UK preventing non-essential travel, the charity said. Paula Boyden, the Dogs Trustaposs veterinary director, said: It is absolutely heartbreaking that we continue to see dogs being illegally imported into the country, often in terrible conditions to make huge profits for cruel puppy smugglers. We might be in the midst of a pandemic, but these devious sellers will still use every trick in the book to scam unsuspecting dog lovers.  Sadly, itaposs all too easy to be dogfished and it can be very dficult to knowyou are buying a puppy that has been smuggled. The three Maltese, two Havanese and one bichon frise pups, aged around  weeks old, were found in an appalling condition and suffering from diarrhoea. All had to be shaved to get rid of the oil and are now in the Dogs Trustaposs care and will be rehomed responsibly when they are fit and able.Ms Boyden added: We would advise you to always see a puppy with and interacting with their mum and go and see it more than once. Ask lots of questions, and ask to see vital paperwork, such as a puppy contract. If you have any doubts or it feels too good to be true, as hard as it may be, walk away and report the seller.

Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said the worst of the weather will be seen in Wales before the weekend with mm plus in some of the more exposed spots.Temperatures once again held back because of the cloud and outbreaks of rain, he continued. National Resources Wales has placed two flood alerts in place, as a result. BBC meteorologist Tomascz Schafernaker agreed Britain is going to be left particularly soggy with outbreaks of rain to hang around for  hours or so. However, he said the weekendaposs looking pretty good with lots of warm sunshine on the way - and some forecasters predict the UK could see seven days of heat next week.  Netweather weather charts show temperatures hitting C between next Sunday and July  but the forecaster has also indicated C is possible. In the meantime, Mr Schafernaker said a ribbon of cloud stretching all the way from Denmark across the UK, out in the Atlantic will bring waves of rain rippling along today. The elongated weather fronts currently cloaking Britain saw temperatures plummet in Scotland overnight, with highs of just C in the north while some of the glens were expected to drop to freezing.  However, Mr McGivern said a south westerly breeze is bringing increasingly humid air meaning much of the country will feel muggy with average temperatures of C. He said rainfall will be on and off rather than persistent but there will be some heavier outbreaks at times, particularly in southern England and South Wales. A cloudy picture, a grey and gloomy picture, he added.

Jack Gershman, , and his -year-old dad Dr Ari Gershman were on a trip off-roading in their brand new Jeep Rubicon on Friday when the gunman struck. Police say he had already pulled the trigger on two people in a separate attack when he killed Dr Gershman in Tahoe National Forest near Downieville, Calornia. After witnessing his dad being killed the traumatised teenager hiked for an hour through a Sierra Nevada forest to get a signal on his mobile phone so he could raise the alarm - he had just one per cent left on his battery. It took around five hours for the authorities to track down Jack and when he was found he was covered in bug bites because he was only wearing shorts and t-shirt. Jack told his rescuers that he was able to get water from a stream he came across while walking in the forest. The dad and son had left home at .am and at around .pm they pulled up to ask for directions from the gunman, who was driving an all-terrain vehicle .Marlo Meyers-Barer, Ariaposs cousin, told the San Francisco Chronicle that the killer started shooting out of nowhere.He said: Ari stepped on the gas to get out of harms way, but one of the shots ripped through the seat and hit him. He was able to get the Jeep stopped so Jack was able to run into the forest to hide.  Mario said his cousin collapsed and died at the scene. Just before the shooting, Dr Gershmanaposs we, Paige had sent a text to her husband to let him know that she received promising test results after being diagnosed six weeks ago with Hodgkinaposs Lymphoma. Paige said she had been tracking their progress on the trip using her phone but because her husband is a doctor she thought it was odd he didnapost respond. According to Mario, Jack called  before calling his mother, around .pm and told her: Dadaposs been shot and I think heaposs dead and Iaposm running away, uphill and I donapost know where I am.  He went on to tell her mum it had taken him an hour to climb to find signal for his phone which had one per cent battery power. Mario and Paige drove four hours to Downieville, and on the way they received messages Jack had tried to send earlier in the day when he had no signal. Mario said: He said he was sorry and to tell his brother and sister he loved them. And he loved his mom. It was gut-wrenching. Deputies at a sherfaposs office broke the news to Mario and Paige that her husband had been found dead and Jack was still missing.  However rescuers contacted network provider ATT to help track Jackaposs phone and despite it being out of battery power the satellites picked up signals near to where he was. A group of around  people were searching for Jack and when they were within half a mile of the location given to them by ATT, they started shouting his name until they heard a reply. During the search Jackaposs family spent  hours listening to a radio in the basement of the Sierra County Sherfaposs Office before rescuers found him. Police spotted the suspected gunman shortly after Jack was found and chased him down on Saturday, the sherfaposs office said.  The suspect is believed to have shot two other people during a separate attack in the same area on Friday. The Sierra County District Attorney’s Office said no charges had been filed as of Tuesday. According to the Chronicle, the suspect shot a person who found him rummaging through their belongings and after fleeing in an ATV he pulled the trigger on a woman who was walking her dog.The sherfaposs office said in a Facebook post that the two victims were rushed to hospital with non-le threatening injuries."},{"url":null,"title":"man jokingly shares neighbours petty","story":"NewsMan jokingly shares neighbours petty lawn mowing act and sparks fierce debateA man shared a photo of how his neighbour mowed the lawn at the front of their attached homes - and the image has ided opinion over whether it was the right thing to doShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  JUL NewsHe called it top class grass banter\", url\"News, views and top stories .

The user who uploaded the photo hilariously added: Decided Iaposm going to leave it, when their grass grows back Iaposll mow mine. I will like this game. One reply labelled it   for pettiness and plenty of people came back with their own suggestions of how to take revenge. Never cut that piece of grass, ever. Let it become a jungle, one comment read. A second said: You need to knock and seeyou can borrow his lawn mower.  Another added: Put a string line from wall square of house which will show he has cut part of yours. Then note through door saying please do the cut my grass again. But some people argued they would have done the same, as one replied: Not sure why you expect them to do it  I get itaposs just a bit, but itaposs still yours.

She vanished thirteen years and no body has ever been found in the massive global search for her. British police have always investigated Maddieaposs disappearance as a missing persons case.

Images of Edouard from space show it gathering pace and growing as it northeasrward. According to the National Hurricane Centre, the cyclone is forecast to continue moving rapidly before it is expected to be absorbed into a larger front over the North Atlantic today. NASA said the cyclone was officially born on July  and is the fth tropical storm of the Atlantic Ocean this hurricane season. National Hurricane Center forecaster Jack Beven noted, “The cyclone is located in a region of strong southwesterly vertical wind shear, is heading for colder water, and is approaching a frontal system.  This combination should lead to extratropical transition between  to  hours, and it is possible that Edouard could strengthen a little as transition occurs.  After transition, the extratropical low should persist for another  hours or so before the circulation dissipates.” While Edouard will considerably be less powerful by the time it hits Britain, forecasters are warning of plenty of unsettled weather to come.Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said the worst of the weather will be seen in Wales before the weekend with mm plus in some of the more exposed spots.Temperatures once again held back because of the cloud and outbreaks of rain, he continued. National Resources Wales has placed two flood alerts in place, as a result. BBC meteorologist Tomascz Schafernaker agreed Britain is going to be left particularly soggy with outbreaks of rain to hang around for  hours or so. However, he said the weekendaposs looking pretty good with lots of warm sunshine on the way - and some forecasters predict the UK could see seven days of heat next week.

The newborns died three hours apart despite the efforts of doctors to save them at Samarkand region children’s hospital. Initially reported as a “two-headed baby”, the twins lived only nine days and died from “respiratory distress and heart failure”. They shared two lungs and a single stomach. The twins’ tragic condition was identied in a scan at  weeks - but the mother was prevented from undergoing an abortion because of strong pressure within her deeply religious family. The woman, who already has three healthy children, was ordered by her father-in-law to go ahead with the birth, they said. A report said: “It is hard to imagine what she was thinking all these months.” After seeing the tragic twins, the man - who identied himself as the head of a devout Muslim family - decided the child should be given away into state care. “I made a mistake,” he said. The twins’ father was quoted as saying: I treated herwell, I did not beat her. “I did not offend her so why were such children born  It comes after the worldaposs oldest conjoined wins - Ronnie and Donnie Gaylon - died aged  on July .

whose son Sam, two, spent time in the neonatal unit after he was born # has said she wants to continue helping the facility.She said: #The collection went really well and there were a lot more people than I expected.#It all started the previous week when someone who works in the neonatal unit put a post in one of the mums# groups on Facebook appealing for people to donate items, as they were getting really short.#They have not been getting donations, and even when they have it is hard to manage because things have to be left outside and then sorted, which means a lot of extra work for the nurses who don#t really have the time.#We have experience of being in the neonatal unit with Sam and it just made me feel awful, so I decided I wanted to do something. We collected all the items, sorted them and then arranged for them to be picked up.#She added: #Having a baby in the neonatal unit is horrible and it can be a really scary time.#Any new baby arriving is a scary time for families and them having to be in the unit is even worse.#But one thing I always remember is the people who work there are exceptional. They do an absolutely amazing job.#If it#s needed, I would be happy to do another collection. It would be good to do it in another part of the city to give more people the opportunity to donate.#Katie, who is also mum to -week-old Ruby, who was born during lockdown, was helped by her mum Michelle Wade and partner Ross Ingram.And she explained her desire to do her bit for families unable to get support from family and friends due to coronavirus.She said: #I had Ruby during lockdown and it was really hard because we were not able to get the usual support from friends and family you would normally get.#Having a new baby is very dficult at the best of times but even more so now, asa dad has to go out to pick something up he isn#t allowed back in.#Hopefully now people will be able to see more of friends and family and get that support they need.#Kirsty Cox, chairwoman of Friends of Neonatal, said: #We are incredibly grateful to Katie for organising a drop off point for the collecting.#She collect a huge amount of items. They have been kept in our store just now and will be delivered to the unit when safe to do so.#We also received lots of items by post and handed in so it been overwhelming the response she had.#Katie really did a fantastic job giving up her timeto do this.#These items will help tremendously to the unit, parents and babies there who need them at such a dficult time.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

There is no set timescale for this to take place, but it can take up to two years to complete.No work will be able to begin to go ahead until acquisition of the land is completed.When approved, it was hoped the scheme would be finished by autumn , however the timescales for all projects have been pushed back due to pandemic restrictions.It was originally budgeted at £. million in November , and is planned to fit in with other traffic-reducing measures such as the AWPR, Diamond Bridge and Haudagain bypass.It will also help deliver phase two of the city centre masterplan, a -year regeneration programme that was adopted by the city council in .Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden encouraged anyone with opinions on the scheme to voice them.He said: #I encourage everyone that has something to say about it to get involved. Now is the chance to air their views.#It is really the time at the moment for everyone to engage with the process.#An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “Roads engineers are in the process of refining the design and we plan to share our proposals through a public engagement exercise.“The public engagement was originally intended to happen towards the end of July but unfortunately, due to staff resourcing issues arising as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, it is now likely to be some time in August.#This date however is dependent on staff being available as workloads for coronavirus hopefully decrease.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

So many of our brilliant leaders are still running meetings online, helping Scouts catch up with their friends and continue to earn their awards.At a time when our children#s lives are so badly disrupted, these sessions are providing a sense of normality and continuity that#s so important for their well-being.

But seeing how our wee community comes together in times of need is always inspiring. Everything from businesses volunteers adapting to supply frontline workers with much-needed supplies, to people volunteering to collect shopping and essentials for people shielding.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it. This old ruin is one of them for me.It is such places I look forward to visiting as the lockdown eases."},{"url":null,"title":"farewell-alfred-alf-tesoro","story":"He died suddenly of a presumed heart attack at the age of , as he ed to his home in Eskside West after buying his daily newspaper on June .Due to current Covid- restrictions, a private service was conducted on Monday, June , at Inveresk Cemetery by Father Basil Clark, from Our Lady of Loretto Church on Newbigging, Musselburgh.The funeral cortegravege travelled along North High Street, passing his former cafe premises for the last time, to applause from members of the local community who lined the street to pay their respects.His niece Anita Cullinan said: ldquoOur family were truly touched by all who turned up to witness Alfrsquos last journey through Musselburgh ndash people who perhaps personally knew Alf or who had grown up during the years the shop was open.ldquoWersquod like to thank them for turning out and for the deeply respectful applause as the cortegravege passed by.Alf was born in the house above the shop on  North High Street on July , , the middle child of Edoardo Tesoro and Zelinda Costa Tesoro, whose other two children were Eolanda and Bert.Edoardo started the cafe known as A.Tesoro in , and his brother Emilio also started a Tesoro cafe across the bridge in Musselburgh around the same time.

This means that, under current rules, only members of the same household or extended household group are permitted to stay away from home together.The previous five mile travel distance limit for leisure has been lted, though the public are still being encouraged to stay within their local area where possible.Self-contained self-catering holiday accommodation across Scotland has also begun to reopen for bookings, including a iety of businesses such as caravan parks and camping sites.

This means that a maximum of two householdscould book a trip away together in England.Bear in mind thatthis combined household tots up to more than six people, you would have to avoid gathering outside, as the rule on a maximum of six people meeting outside still stands.The government has advised holidaymakers to ldquotake particular care to maintain excellent hygiene - washing hands and surfaces - and avoid using shared facilities like bathrooms wherever possible.In Northern Ireland, people who do not live together are allowed to meet indoors in groups of up to six, with distancing measures in place.Similarly to the rest of the UK, support bubbles including one single parent or single adult household have been permitted to mingle with one another.However, while self-catering and non self-catering accommodation is open in Northern Ireland, overnight stays with another household - outside of support bubbles - are not currently permitted.As of  July, people in Wales are permitted to travel more than five miles from their home, and the Welsh government has said residents can start booking holidays in self-contained accommodation from  July.From the same date, Wales has also given the go-ahead for two households to form an \"extended household\" in which physical distancing will not be required.

But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

It also shows that, in the general population in England, support for independence is at %, which is interesting because thatrsquos broadly where support for Scottish independence was in Scotland  years ago. In other words, this could be the beginning of a new trend in England, who knows.In other ways, the poll is only confirming what we know already: the highest support for nationalism and independence in England comes from voters who lean to the right whereas in Scotland, it generally comes from the left. But that doesnrsquot mean wersquore dealing with completely dferent beasts here. Far from it: there are striking similarities between the instincts of some English Tories and Scottish nationalists and they help explain two things: why the parties behave as they do, and why there is a large group of voters they struggle to reach.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeIn the case of the Conservative Party, English Tories ndash like Scottish nationalists ndash have always possessed a strong sense of national identity, sometimes romantic, sometimes bellicose. At party conferences, Tories are unselfconscious about bellowing out Land of Hope and Glory in the way that Scottish nationalists are unselfconscious about Flower of Scotland. The leaders of the Tory party have also always known the power of English iconography ndash Stanley Baldwin used to talk about ldquothe tinkle of the hammer on the anvil and the call of the corncrake on a dewy morning ndash just as SNP leaders know the power, for some, of tartan and bagpipes.Politically, Tory leaders ndash again, like leaders of the SNP ndash have also always been aware of the usefulness of national identity . Disraeli said he had ldquoalways considered that the Tory party was the national party of England and a few years later leading Tories set up the Patriotic Association with a weekly paper called ldquoEngland. Some  years later, Boris Johnson tapped into exactly the same English patriotism to fuel support for the campaign to leave the European Union just as the SNP taps into Scottish patriotism to fuel support for leaving the UK.The leadership of both the Tories and the SNP are also aware of the trick, because it works for some people, of using national identity to denigrate their opponents as un-English, un-Scottish, un-patriotic or un-something . Disraeli said Liberalismrsquos aim was to ldquoeffect the disintegration of the Empire of England whereas the leadership of the SNP frequently accuse their opponents of failing to stand up for Scotland or doing it down. Itrsquos all the same kind of stuff really, whether itrsquos English or Scottish or British: nationalism as a stirrer of intense passions and a political recruiter.But it only goes so far, because not everyone is stirred by nationalistic sentiments: some hearts soar but some hearts sink, and that poses a problem for politicians of a nationalistic bent. Strident types of English, or Scottish, nationalism have always been unattractive to many liberals and voters who occupy the crucial centre ground ndash the kind that the SNP in particular needs to recruit. More recently, some of the more liberal Tory leaders have also struggled in  for example, Alex Salmond showed no shame or embarrassment in his patriotism and nationalism, while for David Cameron it was all a bit squirmy and awkward.Whatrsquos happening is that all of this creates issues for centrist politicians who oppose nationalism, like Cameron in  or Keir Starmer in , particularly when, in all its forms, nationalism appears to be on the rise. However, it also poses problems for English Tories and Scottish nationalists who seek to exploit it ndash and it may explain why support for Brexit and Scottish independence both hover around % but not much higher.Take Nicola Sturgeon for example. She knows that sounding stridently nationalistic will attract some Scots to her cause but she also knows that sounding too nationalistic could turn off the centrists she needs to win over. Keir Starmer has a similar problem for Labour, only in a dferent direction. He knows that sounding more obviously patriotic could win back some of the support from English nationalists whorsquove gone over to the Tories, particularly in the north of England, but he also knows thathe goes too far, he risks losing support from centrists, particularly in London and, crucially, Scotland.To make matters worse in Scotland, therersquos another problem here, which is that English nationalism may also be fuelling Scottish nationalism or at least support for the SNP. The most recent poll at the weekend confirms support for independence at around % and support for the SNP high enough to win them another election, and much of this has been fuelled by Brexit which in turn has been fuelled by English nationalism.:Support for Scottish independence surges in new poll as SNP look set for landslide victory at Holyrood electionsThe question is how resilient the centre will be in the face of all of this. Clearly, some of the centre ground in Scotland is being eaten away by the SNP, and in a UK context itrsquos left Labour in particular with a dilemma. On English nationalism, one of the solutions that the partyrsquos election review considers is tacking to the centre on economic policy while talking up the partyrsquos patriotic credentials the push and pull of nationalism and unionism is also the reason Labour has been talking about the idea of ldquoradical federalism.But will it be enough  The fear for centrists must be that as English nationalism closes in on one side and Scottish nationalism closes in on the other, like the walls of the trash compactor in Star Wars, the centre will get squished. In a constitutionally eccentric country like the UK, itrsquos also unclear what the centrists can do. One option is to sound more nationalistic, but that may hasten the crushing. The other is to continue to call for another way. But as the walls close in, they may not be heard over the noise.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

The inquisitorial question, ldquoAre you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party, has gone down in history as a chilling expression and reminder of the dangers of right-wing political panics.Today, we find the so-called left, in the form of Rebecca Long Bailey, being sacked, McCarthy style, by Labour leader Keir Starmer, for daring to retweet a newspaper interview with the actor Maxine Peake that had in it a crass and inaccurate reference to Israeli security forces training US police to use the kneeling tactics which killed George Floyd.The irony, of course, is that this sacking does not come with rants about communist atheism, a defence of Christian mortality, ideas of treachery or the lack of loyalty to the nation. It is not a right-wing sacking but an all too familiar ldquoprogressive sacking.It is unlikely that Starmer thinks Long Bailey is actually anti-Semitic and many have suggested this is an opportunistic move on the Labour leaderrsquos behalf to clear out some of the Corbyn supporters in his shadow cabinet. The problem being, of course, that in so doing he is simply applying the modern McCarthyite approach that has been developed by the ldquoleft when dealing with those with whom they disagree.McCarthy and his ilk hated the liberal and left-wing progressives that they saw as dominating the entertainment industry, the luvvies who transgressed from American patriotism and Christian morality. Today, this too has changed, and it is often the cultural elite, the left-luvvies, who are the most ldquoright-thinking, censorious and keen to demand that people be ldquocancelled.Just ask Lawrence Fox, the actor who has been blacklisted for questioning the idea of ldquowhite privilege. Fox fears he may never get another acting job he may well be right.Until relatively recently it was only the most small-minded of bigots who thought it acceptable to sack people because of their ldquoimmoral opinions.

There will never be another When We Were Kings, but a quick glance at Netflix shows some are at least aiming to hit that weight, be it in boxing or basketball .In The Boxer, it seemed at times as though the filmmakers were trying to make a virtue out of how ordinary Fraser was, a risky gambit. If she was so unremarkable, so nice woman next door, why bother spending an hour getting to know her She had certainly had her battles to fight, as a woman, and a gay woman, in a male-dominated sport and society. She touched on those, and her faith, but never lingered for long.Maybe there was no more to it. If there was we did not hear much about it.

The glimpse behind the scenes at the bouts were intermittently engaging. ldquoMay the best girl win, said one referee, showing there is some ways to go in making the world of boxing ldquowoke.The hour came alive, though, when we saw Fraser fighting, and when it emerged she and Kirsty were having a baby. This was more like it ndash a great story, boxer felled by love for a baby, and the scenes at home with the three of them were wonderful, telling us in a glance here and a gesture there how much this had changed everything.With the clock running down it seemed asthe tale was going to stop there. There was one last attempt at injecting drama when Fraser injured her knee , but Davie was working hard trying to line up a world title fight.Then came the ultimate below the belt blow: Covid- arrived, and the world, sporting and otherwise, was shut down. It was less a big bang ending than a slow fizzle, but Fraser promised she would keep going. ldquoI was made to be a world champion. Thatrsquos who I am, she said.

But we are concerned that all the optimistic talk may end up being just thatit is not backed up by specic actions. Yes, Scotland can build a positive legacy out of lockdown, but we need to focus on the practicalities of that, not just the aspiration.CAS doesnrsquot claim to have all the answers here. But with our unique perspective of  years of helping people deal with their problems, we feel we understand the issues that need to be addressed, and we are keen to contribute to making the re-boot happen.So over the summer we will use our weekly column here to set out in detail how we believe public policy needs to be re-focused. We will look at the role of social security how we can help people stay in their homes how debt holds iniduals back and hampers wider economic recovery and how telecommunications can be used to keep people connected both socially and to services. Today I will start by looking at the issue of employment and workers rights.Since the start of lockdown the proportion of advice the Scottish Citizens Advice network has given about employment has swelled to three times what is typical. Itrsquos been our biggest area of growth during the pandemic. And in particular, in the first three weeks of June, one in five pieces of employment advice we gave was about redundancy.So, while the Job Retention Schemewas a bold and necessary measure, both governments need to think now about how to protect existing jobs as the economy recovers.We would like the UK Government to consider greater flexibility in the timescales for winding down the furlough scheme, taking into consideration the needs of dferent sectors, and the dferent pace to the easing of lockdown in Scotland and other parts of the UK. Wersquod also like to see ongoing protection for workers who need to shield because they are more vulnerable to Covid-. For the medium term we would urge more investment in new jobs, particularly in sectors that can have wider social benefit.Scotlandrsquos transition to net zero can be supported by investment in energy efficiency improvements for homes, which reduces fuel bills for iniduals while boosting employment.We also welcome the Enterprise  Skills Strategic Board in Scotlandrsquos focus on employment for young people, older low-skilled, low-waged workers and women. Since long before Covid-, we have been concerned by the prevalence of low-paid and insecure work, which makes it hard for people to budget and to balance caring responsibilities.Many of these workers have been among the hardest hit by the financial impact of the pandemic ndash unable to access the furlough scheme or statutory sick pay. Others have found themselves out on the frontline, providing key services like care and food retail whilst better paid workers have been able to continue their work safely from home.Scotland cannot plan a recovery on the basis of training everyone on a low wage into so-called ldquohigh-quality jobs, because recent months have highlighted how critical many of those low-paid jobs are. Instead, the value of those jobs needs to be recognised in a new deal for those in traditionally low-paid sectors. A new deal based on higher wages, better terms and conditions and greater flexibility around caring responsibilities. This would involve prioritising the Scottish Governmentrsquos Fair Work agenda, with the care sector being an obvious place to start.These are not radical or new ideas, but without these kinds of changes many workers will continue to rely on benefits to top up low pay. And the social security system as it was pre-lockdown was not fit for purpose and is another area that must be reformedwe are to have any chance of building that fairer country we all want to see.And we will outline our ideas for those reforms here in coming weeks.Mhoraig Green is Social Justice spokesperson at Citizens Advice Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"kate-forbes-joins-forces-welsh-northern-irish-counterparts-plea-powers","story":"Scotlandrsquos Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has previously called on the Chancellor to draw up pound billion spending plans to revive the UK economy ndash and has alsopleaded for greater borrowing powers to ensure officials in Edinburgh can better equip the country to reboot as the lockdown is eased.MsForbes initial request was ldquokicked into the long grass but she has now been handed the support of her Welsh counterpart Rebecca Evans andNorthern Irelandrsquos Finance Minister Conor Murphy.The joint plea is calling for flexibility to be able to switch funding for capital infrastructure projects to be used for day-to-day spending ndash as well as removing limits on devolved governmentsrsquo borrowing powers.MsForbesis calling on the Chancellor to ldquoease these rigid fiscal rules to help Scotland ldquoproperly address themonumentalchallenges facing the economy.:Kate Forbes draws up poundbn proposals to re-start UK economy and avoid austerityShe added:ldquoThe powers we are seeking will enable the Scottish Government to respond to Covid- more effectively and reboot our economy.ldquoThey are relatively limited powers but would ease some of the immense pressures on our budget and give us more tools to kickstart our recovery.ldquoAt the moment, any extra money spent bolstering services and supporting the economy recovery must be taken from other areas.

So, action to keep youth unemployment down is crucial to avoiding lasting damage to careers that are just getting started.ldquoIt is very welcome that the Government has opted for a bold and ambitious scheme, with pound billion potentially meaning jobs for around , young people.

But he also conceded that it was a failure in the game that a player had not felt able to do so.But Mr Nicolson said: \"I dont have any sense at all that it is a far more welcoming place. By definition,it was a far more welcoming place, people would feel free to come out.\"His commentary came in a discussion with Paul Cleal, an adviser to several relevant organisations including the Premier League who told him that mens football was \"not welcoming enough\".He believed football was more concerned about behaviour of people in the stadia and social media, which he said was \"a shame\".A spokesman for the FA the governing body of football in England said: \"Coming out, irrespective of gender, is an inidual and personal decision. Having a support network and allies, whether thatrsquos teammates, friends or family, can be crucial in this process and we will always offer the full support of The FA to anybody that chooses to come out.\"We continue to work with our partners across the game, such as Stonewall, LGBT fan groups, campaign groups and the leagues, to help create a safe and comfortable environment for any player to come outthey wish to do so.

But that first group is much larger.He added: ldquoWhat is quite interesting is thatwe bookend this, immediately after the EU referendum, the weekend after, there were two or three polls that suggested support for independence had gone up. But that didnrsquot last, it was almost a knee-jerk reaction to what had happened in the Brexit vote.ldquoBut we are now starting to see a pattern emerging from enough polls to suggest this is not just a blip. That something a little more signicant ndash both in the number of polls and the level of support and in terms of theof time ndash this has been noticeable for a good six to eight months now.ldquoIt is a really fascinating time in Scottish politics at the moment.

In fact, in a way, I was pleased, as we had had a massive focus on education. So for the public to have picked up an affinity with children and young people showed there was something there cutting through.ldquoIrsquod much rather have had that set of outcomes, than some of the other possibilities that could have come from that."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-raised-restore-fife-zoo-blaze-owners-share-devastating-pictures-aftermath","story":"Owners of Fe Zoo have shared devastating images of the damage caused by the fire on Sunday, July , which is said to have started in the soft play area of the premises.A charred image of science and environmentalist Sir David Attenborough was the first thing found by bosses after firefighters controlled the flames.:Fire crews battle blaze at Fe ZooThe zoo, near Collessie and Cupar, reopened on June  after closing in March due to the coronavirus lockdown.But it was forced to evacuate tourists and subsequently close its doors for several days after the fire.This first thing we came across after the blaze.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

this time to do battle in the Glamaig Stableford competition.Only two played in the competition won by Sandi Beatson # that#s three-in-a-row for her.The boys to come out to play and play they most certainly did in earnest competition for the RNLI Shield.There was a very good turnout on the Saturday of this weekend competition with the weather conditions certainly predicted to favour that particular day#s cohort.Covid  restrictions meant that instead of the normal random #draw# for partners players arranged their own #friendship groups# and appropriate tee times on the required booking sheet.Battle commenced # and what a scrap it turned out to be.Five players reduced their handicaps but there could only be one winner, and that was Robert Macaskill.Off the first tee at am his golf was very steady with  bfs required to navigate the outward nine but a miserly  hits required to conclude his great round.His #touch# round the greens was apparently sensitive in the extreme with a chip-in for par on , #up and down# from Billy the Bunker on , a chip-in birdie on  and several other good chances.All in all just a very good, tidy performance. points then for loop one and  points for loop two and that strong finish was to be the decisive factor as his margin of victory was only decided by virtue of the #better inward half# in a photo-finish with good friend and Vice-Captain Ally Young who was to submit his tremendous score in very inclement playing conditions some  hours later!Ally#s two nines, off his  handicap were  and  with a birdie thrown into each loop for good measure and a stableford points conversion for his halves of  and  points respectively.Incidentally, the putter must have been behaving because it holed a  foot putt on the fourth hole and a  footer on the th for #birds#.NB it was the tool and not the workman.Ally also had the consolation of reducing his handicap by two shots # the biggest reduction among the prizewinners # because of the status of his exact handicap which, like all players is calculated to the decimal point.We had enough jargon last week so we#ll let that slip by unnoticed shall we No question his was the better performance in the respective conditions but it#s Robert who will receive the trophy-and quite properly regain the bragging rights in the house of Macaskill.Two points behind the leaders a trio of players each ed very respectable totals of points.Andrew Long made contact with the ball  times on his outward half with the highlight being a good birdie on the dficult th hole and required but  strokes coming home with a remarkable run of ten straight pars from holes  to .John Maclean played steadily, albeit with early drama in his round # a nasty triple-bogey seven on the second hole.Chapfallen  No chance as composure regained he recorded  for his first lap of the circuit followed by  blows next time round.Ross Cumming#s two nines were  and  off his #mark# so in the company of his #old fella# that day he showed who was #the man#.Ross too suffered an early dig in the ribs with a triple bogey on the second hole but also did well to recover and tickle a touch off the handicap on completion of his round.No midweek competition for the gents this time round but the ‘Trouts’ came out to play in a pop-up Seniors Mixed Stableford competition later that week.With outdoor catering billed as an #attraction# for the silver sharpshooters the beau monde of the area swarmed like locusts to the feast.The format for the day was successful as almost  of the area#s finest ladies and gentlemen golfers paraded their skills on a course displaying promising signs of extremely rude health # apart from the reepach humple on the second fairway # and it was to be an overseas raider who was tohome victorious.Ally #Doc# Mackenzie, now domiciled in Plockton was to be #the man# with an extremely comfortable victory following a rich harvest of points in the forgiving Stableford format.His winning total of  points was four clear of Chris Mackinnon in second place.Alaisdair # a #friend# said his father couldn#t spell # rather limped out in  strokes but a fine  off his  mark coming home garnered a whopping  points to add to the earlier  and his unassailable total.Nothing much of interest in the  but an evil nine and an excellent wee two showed the extremes to which our man travelled on his homeward journey.Rumour has it that #our hero# offered to buy free drinks for everyone # in the sure and certain knowledge that with the lockdown still to be relaxed his money was safe!I also have it on good authority that his often misunderstood droll countenance momentarily offered a fleeting smile of satisfaction in victory before swtly and almost immediately reverting to type.Chris Mackinnon started brightly with only three dozen shots required to pilot his ball round the opening nine holes but  coming home with an horrendous triple bogey  on the final hole may have left a wee bit of a bitter taste in the mouth afterwards.Third place went to Dave Webster who ed a very impressive total of  points off his  handicap mark but a few more performances like that and he could be back playing with the big boys again.The size of the field offers a wee bit more scope for reflection and Donalda Johnston found form and Peter Mackenzie, kin to the winner smoothed in one further point behind Dave Webster.Honourable mention too for George Neill who might have #thought he was Archie# having recorded two birdies in his opening seven holes but sadly thereafter the ba# burst.And finally to the mystery of the #Captain#s eagle#.It#s been dficult trying to untangle the whole story occurring as it did in an unofficial, non-counting charity game but a source, when catechised offered the following description -#a Phil Mickelson-type shot landed like a dislodged swan#s feather on the green with precisely the correct velocity to carry it to the hole with not a millimetre to spare#!What preceded the shot that elicited that magniloquent delineation is still to be ascertained. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

This is entirely within the Education Minister#s remit, and to not consider alternatives as a matter of urgency is both negligent and unfair.Mr Lyttle, her Alliance colleague and education committee chairman, said Mr Weir#s refusal was surprising and unacceptable, and should be reversed.This year#s post-primary transfer tests have been delayed by two weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic.The parents of two children in Northern Ireland have won High Court permission to challenge decisions to delay the tests.Their lawyers argued last month that the decision to delay by a matter of weeks amid so much disruption to their education is unlawful.Meanwhile, a number of Catholic grammars and an integrated school have said they will not use transfer test results to admit pupils in .Belfast Related ContentEditor#s ViewpointEditor#s ViewpointOpinionEducation Minister Peter Weir was wrong to snub worried parentsApart from the NHS, education has been the public service hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. It has caused severe disruption at pivotal periods of thousands of children#s lives, forced parents to attempt to home school and to work from home in order to look after their offspring.Most ReadNoah Donohoe dad: The son I never metFor sale!

A Ulster University graduate, Shawn said that he is now planning to treat his family with his windfall.Read MoreEditor#s Viewpoint:Opinion £m winner Shawn not the only beneficiary from lotteryHe purchased some scratchcards at the end of a sht which led him to buying his winning card.It all started when I bought a couple of £ scratchcards on the Friday night, explained Shawn. I won £ on those so, as I was leaving work around .pm on Saturday evening, I bought a couple of £ scratchcards with my winnings.It was only when Shawn arrived home and was preparing to get ready for a socially distanced garden party with friends that he remembered he had the scratchcards in his jacket.He said he could not believe it when he discovered the numbers on one of the cards matched, and he had won the top prize of £m.At first I thought it must be a fake card and I checked every inch of it to make sure it was real, continued Shawn.I ran through the details with a lovely lady on the end of the phone before she said the magic words… #Congratulations, you#ve won a million pounds#, he recalled.I really couldn#t believe what I was hearing. I was still trying to process what was happening while my mum was already making plans for a new asphalt driveway at the front of the house, which they#ve been working on. Then she phoned my brother Paul in England and I texted my brother Gavin in Australia - both of whom naturally thought we were joking, he laughed.Shawn, however, was soon brought back down to earth after he received a phone call from the store assistant who had earlier sold him the winning scratchcard.The call came through and immediately I thought this was it - I#d been the victim of an elaborate prank, said Shawn. But it turned out there was just a problem with the fridge in the shop so I had to go round and fix it, knowing that I#d literally just won a million.Despite his new millionaire status, Shawn says that he will continue to work at McNicholl#s Eurospar. As well as a new driveway and shed for his mum, and treating the rest of his family, he wants to buy a Range Rover and go on a holiday abroad.Shawn said customers have been popping into the store to congratulate him since news of his win broke locally.It#s crazy, because it#s only been a matter of weeks since I was chatting to customers about Robert Fullerton from Castledawson who won £, on a scratchcard in May, he added.We were just saying how amazing it would be to win that sort of money. Now here I am, just two months later, having won a million quid. It just goes to show that anyone can win it at any time. I just feel lucky and blessed that on this occasion, it was my turn.

Just some of the hair mishaps stylists will have to tackle after over  days of closure. On Monday, normally a day of rest for the hair and beauty industry, the latest easing of restrictions meant demand for a post-lockdown top-to-toe transformation was sky high. And judging by the volume of phone calls and messages from clients scrambling to get an appointment, salons are set for a busy few weeks.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBen Magowan has his hair cut at Shankeys on Belfast’s Lisburn RoadStephen Hamilton FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBen Magowan has his hair cut at Shankeys on Belfast’s Lisburn RoadAs well as hairdressers and barbers, beauty salons and tattoo parlours were also back in business. Belfast#s Lisburn Road was a hive of activity as men seeking urgent restyles queued up outside the numerous barber shops dotted across both sides of the thoroughfare. Despite cups of coffee and glossy magazines being out, and facemasks, hand sanitiser and Perspex screens in, salons have been booked out weeks in advance.At Andrew Watson Hairdressing, Una Calvert from east Belfast was sitting comfortably in front of the mirror for her first cut and colour since January. You have no idea how long I#ve waited for this day. I have been tempted to put all sorts of things in my hair but I#ve stayed away from home dye, she said. Apart from trimming my fringe, I leave it all to the experts. Once I heard when salons could reopen I was straight on the phone to Andrew and I#m so delighted to be here on the first day back.As a long-time client Una said she had absolutely no qualms about coming back in. Andrew is an excellent hairdresser and always reliable, so I had every confidence that everything would be in place.At this stage I just want to leave with a nice hairstyle. PPE-clad Andrew was equally excited to be back despite facing the prospect of an -hour working week to tackle the backlog.At first it felt like the first day at school with some nervousness but soon it was as though we#d never been away, he laughed.

Six couples are bringing legal action against the Government over rules which mean humanist marriage ceremonies in England and Wales are not legally valid. As the landmark challenge kicked off in a remote Skype hearing yesterday, the couples argued they are being unlawfully discriminated against due to their beliefs and do not want a civil marriage with humanist #bells on#. They include Carrickfergus couple Jenny McCalmont and Finbar Graham, both .They plan to marry on July  in a humanist ceremony at a beach in Devon where they first holidayed together and where Jenny#s parents live. Humanist weddings, involving a non-religious ceremony, are legal in Northern Ireland and Scotland but are still not considered official in either England or Wales.Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, lead counsel for the claimants, said they were listening to the hearing eagerly from around the country. She said that all the couples wish, or would have wished for those who are already married, to have legally binding humanist marriages in England. But they have been prevented from marrying in the way that they wish and in accordance with their beliefs as a result of the operation of English law. It#s a matter of profound concern to all  claimants, and for some of the claimants it#s been extremely distressing and has caused very particular personal and family dficulties, Ms Gallagher said. She pointed out the importance of a wedding day for the six couples, and made reference to the Law Commission#s scoping paper Getting Married. She read a section which said: A couple#s wedding day is one of profound emotional, cultural, social and legal signicance. It is often presented as the best or most important day of one#s le, and as a result is generally seen as requiring a special level of celebration and expenditure, both by the couple and by family and friends. Court papers say the claimants want to have an explicitly humanist form of marriage, adding: They do not want a civil marriage with humanist #bells on#. The document goes on: Legal recognition validityis also important to the claimants because it signies that the state recognises that their deeply held beliefs, and the cause of humanism, are legitimate and worthy of recognition and respect on an equal footing with religious people. Marriage, for the claimants, is a profoundly humanist event reflecting a right to marry and the universal human values of love, fidelity, trust, sharing and co-operation. They believe that this is the one le they will ever have. In that context, the decision to marry, for humanists, takes on an even more profound signicance. The challenge, which is being heard by Mrs Justice Eady, is being opposed by the Government. The couples are being supported in their action by Humanists UK, which has been campaigning on the issue for some years. Humanists UK president Alice Roberts said: A humanist marriage is something so incredibly special - a ceremony where the couple decides on the meanings, beliefs and values they feel important - rather than having to shoehorn themselves into some other template that society is forcing on them. It represents that freedom of belief that is a fundamental human right. I find it so extraordinary that while humanist marriages are legally recognised in Scotland and Northern Ireland, they#re not in England and Wales. This is about human rights. As humanist ceremonies are not recognised in law in England and Wales, couples with humanist beliefs must also have a civil ceremony. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: We want to give couples more choice in how they celebrate their commitment to each other. That is why we asked the Law Commission to review marriage and make recommendations for a simple, fair and consistent system for all. The hearing is expected to last two days.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe dad: The son I never metFor sale!

Molly Elliott died on June . Molly, who lived in the Top of the Hill area of the city, was -years-old. Her sudden death has left her family and many friends heartbroken. Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing. Addressing the congregation at Mollys funeral last week, her aunt, Lynn, asked for prayers for all those without hope. googletag.cmd.push “Help all the young people here today, help them Father to talk, to listen, to hear and to seek the help they need. “This is not the answer,you could all just look to your left, to your right, front and back, you will see mums and dads praying this is not coming to their door. “Please, please let our beautul Molly be the last,” she said. Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.

This week I want to highlight the plight of many small businesses across the city and tell you what you can do to help them survive. For the past  weeks many businesses have shut their doors and either furloughed staff or made them redundant. Now, however, is the time to get the economy on this Island back up and running. We cant as a society afford to stay shut any longer. There isnt the option to stay closed and until a vaccine is found. googletag.cmd.push This is just fancul thinking and would bankrupt any economy that attempted this strategy. We must learn to live with the virus within our society and shield the most vulnerable from it. The rest of us must take responsibility for our own protection and follow the guidelines set out by government. Both the British and Irish governments in fairness have risen to the challenge and supported businesses and workers for the last four months. The continuation of this support indefinitely isnt economically sustainable. The cost of the support to date has been largely borrowed by governments and will need to be repaid at some stage by raising taxes. googletag.cmd.push There is no such thing as free money from any government in the world. If you get something from government, it will most certainly will be got back by a tax.  So, lets all accept that we have suppressed the virus and now is the time to re-open our economy and get back to work as best we can in the circumstances. Now let us not forget that many of our local businesses watched in dismay as their income streams totally dried up in March. Over the last three months many have had virtually no income, but bills have still mounted up. Some got reduced rates and rents, however bills unpaid since March are waiting for them now as they open. Landlords will be looking rent again and creditors will be looking paid. The Inland Revenue who has been quiet for a while will be back looking for taxes due for last year and on account for . As these small firms re-open their doors and staff come off government furlough schemes the next few months will either make or break them. They really need our support folks so please support themyou can. Very few businesses havent been affected by this crisis and as the economy begins, the bills may come at them quicker than their customers. There could be a bloodbath in terms of bankruptciesphysical re-opening is ahead of consumer confidence. Many local businesses are opening tentatively not knowingcustomers willin the pre-Covid numbers. For some businesses consumer confidence is their biggest issue. Many customers might shun these businesses for fear of catching the virus. The fear factor is still pretty high amongst some consumer groups, but I hope this is confined just to people that fall into the highest risk of infection . For other businesses like restaurants hairdressers etc. the problem will be the new guidelines and how they effect the delivery of the service and capacity of the business. A good example of this can be seen in the recent price hikes announced by hairdressers in Dublin before they re-opened. With capacity reduced signicantly due to social distancing and the additional costs linked to cleaning hygiene etc. many had to increase prices by as much as %. I dont expect increases of this scale in Derry but I have a lot of sympathy for a business that is forced to increase their prices due to reduced capacity. Its not price gauging and has more to do with the current restrictions and capacity reduction. People shouldnt jump to social media with tales of being robbed or fleeced. Its really a case of pricing to survive for many businesses. These next few weeks will be make or break for many companies re-opening after the lockdown so I believe its our civic duty to do as much as we can to support them. What can we do  The simplest answer is get out there and spendyou can afford it. Put the keyboard down and stop buying online unless you really have to. Book a meal and get out there and enjoy a might out. By doing this you are not only supporting your local restaurant but you’re also helping to preserve jobs. Get up the town and spend a few pound, would be my advice. What we all do over the next few months can make a huge dference and could help save hundreds of jobs in the city. If we dont engage with our local businesses, they will be forced to lay people off. Go out and buy a bed for the spare room. Get that much needed haircut. Take the boyfriend out for that steak dinner. We really have to support local shops, service providers and manufacturers now more than ever. And remember, we can do all of this and stay safewe follow the rules, wear a mask and keep the proper distance. Taking holidays in Ireland or a Staycation will also help. And folks this is not me crying wolf. Huge jobs losses are already occurring across these Islands as we come out of this crisis. Intu Properties, which owns or part-owns  huge shopping centres across the UK and Spain, including the Trafford centre in Manchester, has filed for bankruptcy already last week. It will not the last business casualty of the Covid- crisis. So do your bit folks. Get back out there and spend what you can afford locally, and help keeps jobs in Derry.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.

It was revealed recently that just over % of all vehicles using the Pennyburn dump in Derry are from the Republic. Concern had been raised that local ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. googletag.cmd.push The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors. There were  southern-registered cars which used the Strahans Road dump in Strabane, out of a total of , visitors. googletag.cmd.push The two other councils dumps that reopened on May  - Strathfoyle and Claudy - had no vehicles from the Republic visit them during the period from May  to May . Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed yesterday at a special meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a working group be set up to look at the issue of vehicles from the Republic using the local recycling centres. This was backed by all other parties on the council apart from Sinn Fein. In a report prepared for yesterdays meeting, it was stated that additional staff would be neededthe council was to monitor vehicles using the recycling centres. The report stated: More recently Members asked that officers consider the implications of a policy that restricts access to recycling sites to those that reside within the Council area only. This would place an additional resource burden on the service in that staff will have to check the residency details of all those entering sites right across the district. Several of the sites operate with a single member of staff, who needs to supervise the disposal of materials and assist those using the site, therefore additional staff would be required at these facilities to ensure compliance.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked.

The council’s Head of Planning had written to the Department’s Chief Planner at the beginning of lockdown to highlight elements of the legislation that may have needed to be amended to protect applicants’ rights during and after the Covid- lockdown. Cllr Kathleen McGurk said the development, which came to light in the recent meeting of the council’s Planning Committee, was disappointing. “It is very disappointing that the detailed advice provided to the Department of Infrastructure was not acted upon by Minister Mallon,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “Planning is an essentialof the economy andit is vital that planning services continueto operate and provide the necessary decisions so that the economy can be supported, particularly in the current climate. “However, there are elements of planning legislation which have very rigid time limitations which could be very clearly affected by the current Pandemic. “Several issues could impact upon applicants including expiration dates of planning permission already granted where works cannot commence due to restrictions during lockdown. “Post lockdown, the inability to engage contractors with backlogs and material shortages could cause similar problems. “I would have expected the Minister to have looked at these issues and amended legislation to ensure applicants are not adversely affected by deadlines.” googletag.cmd.push The council’s Planning Committee has expressed its frustration at the failure to take on board their advice and has agreed to write to the Minister asking her to reconsider.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk said the development, which came to light in the recent meeting of the council’s Planning Committee, was disappointing. “It is very disappointing that the detailed advice provided to the Department of Infrastructure was not acted upon by Minister Mallon,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “Planning is an essentialof the economy andit is vital that planning services continueto operate and provide the necessary decisions so that the economy can be supported, particularly in the current climate. “However, there are elements of planning legislation which have very rigid time limitations which could be very clearly affected by the current Pandemic. “Several issues could impact upon applicants including expiration dates of planning permission already granted where works cannot commence due to restrictions during lockdown. “Post lockdown, the inability to engage contractors with backlogs and material shortages could cause similar problems. “I would have expected the Minister to have looked at these issues and amended legislation to ensure applicants are not adversely affected by deadlines.” googletag.cmd.push The council’s Planning Committee has expressed its frustration at the failure to take on board their advice and has agreed to write to the Minister asking her to reconsider.

Anyone interested in taking part is asked to email mastermind.hth@hattrick to request an application form.

held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Championship draws made  ","story":"THE draws for the  Down Football and Hurling

over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with.

In this his third series, Joe s with another fascinating set of programmes celebrating the mighty achievements of the past that have transformed our daily living and reveals the cutting-edge technology that is shaping the future of our infrastructure.With the help of the experts in their respective fields, Joe reveals the stories behind some of Northern Irelandrsquos well-known landmarks and also sheds light on how civil engineering is in operation quite literally beneath our feet!Get ready to go salt mining, quarry blasting, castle roofing, engine restoring, road surfacing and flood preventing to name a few of the activities that Joe gets involved with in this series.In the opening episode which airs next Monday night at pm, Joe visits Delamont which nestles on the shores of the internationally acclaimed waterway.The country park is home to the largest monolith or standing stone in the UK and Ireland, with the signicant landmark standing  metres tall and weighing in at almost  tonnes.Ancient civilisations throughout the world marked important occasions and cosmic events by erecting megaliths, often in circles or other formations, but sometimes as free-standing monoliths. There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone. Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.Anyone unable to tune in next Monday night can watch the programme on www.itv utvprogrammes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"MP calls for Ancient East tour region to include Down  ","story":"MARKETING a large swathe of East Down on an all-island basis would help produce a signicant boost for local tourism, according to South Down MP Chris Hazzard.He has asked Stormont tourism minister Diane Dodds to work with tourism agencies on either side of the border to extend Irelandrsquos Ancient East Tourism region to include a large part of Down District.Mr Hazzard was responding to the publication of the tourism ministerrsquos lsquoeconomic recovery strategyrsquo and believes that such a move would help the South Down tourism industry recover from Covid- and help mitigate ldquothe looming Brexit shock.Mr Hazzard argues that itrsquos ldquoludicrous that Failte Irelandrsquos lsquoAncient Eastrsquo tourism region stops in Louth, excluding the historically signicant north-east region of the island.He said that a large part of East Down was the playground for Cuacute Chulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhaill ldquowith the landscape forever marked by St Patrickrsquos legacy, surrounded by shoreline that welcomed Vikings, Planters and the Normans.The MP said that in Downpatrick, there are the graves of the patron saint and Viking King Magnus.He continued: ldquoWe have the impressive Downpatrick and Co Down Railway Museum, the only working heritage railway in the North which stretches out to the historic Inch Abbey.ldquoUnder the shadow of Down Cathedral, we have the only St Patrickrsquos visitor exhibition in the world, with the nearby Down County Museum located in the historic buildings of the th century gaol where United Irish leader, Thomas Russell, was executed in .Mr Hazzard said the northern side of Downpatrick was surrounded by the Mound of Down, Finnebrogue Wood and the stunning Quoile Nature Reserve, with Delamont Country Park completing the short journey to the shores of Strangford Lough where the Vikings first landed.ldquoTo the east lies Struell Wells and St Patrickrsquos first church at Saul, a unique site known widely as the cradle of christianity in Ireland, the MP continued, insisting it is ldquosimply unacceptable that this rich heritage would be a victim of partitionism of the very worst kind.Mr Hazzard said local tourism providers had been hit hard by the Covid- pandemic, with many very worried about the impact of Brexit and ldquoneedless bureaucratic hurdles.He continued: ldquoUndoubtedly, they need to be supported in the years ahead and I have have written to the tourism minister asking her to look seriously at this opportunity.ldquoNow is the time to extend the lsquoAncient Eastrsquo region and also the Wild Atlantic Way coastal route into the north to encompass all that is worth seeing on the island of Ireland.He added: ldquoQuite simply, it is the best way to successfully mitigate the impact of Covid- and Brexit on the local tourism industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"New president appointed at Downpatrick Lions Club  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK Lions Club has appointed Raymond Crea as its new president.Mr Crea succeeds Mr John Dennis, who presented him with his chain of office during a socially-distanced handover.Reflecting on his year in office, John said that while it was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, it was nevertheless rewarding, thanking his fellow club members and wider public for their enthusiasm and support.Mr Crea said he was delighted to take over an important role at the helm of the organisation.He said he looked forward to finding new ways to raise funds in what he described as ldquochallenging times for numerous charities that Downpatrick Lions support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul  climbs world’s toughest peaks  ","story":"FOR most of us sleeping on a narrow bed suspended hundreds of metres high off El Capitan, Calorniarsquos famous vertical rock wall in Yosemite Valley, would be utterly fear-inducing.Not so for mountain guide and expert rock climber Paul Swail, who first discovered his love of mountains growing up in Newcastle at the foot of the Mournes.For the  year-old, itrsquos the best nightrsquos sleep ever.ldquoYou get the most amazing nightrsquos sleep in one of those, said Paul, referring to a piece of equipment called a portaledge where rock climbers sleep and eat in during a long climb.ldquoWe spent six days climbing one of the El Cap routes and we didnrsquot want to get out of our beds in the morning.ldquoYes, we were knackered but itrsquos the comfiest thing you will ever sleep on. With all the fresh air and seeing the stars at night, when you wake up, all you can see is the ground hundreds of metres below you, itrsquos just amazing.Paul now lives in Chamonix at the foot of Mont Blanc in the French Alps with his English we, Ellie, and toddler son Luca. Luca was only weeks old when his parents climbed Slieve Donard on a trip home with him safely tucked inside a sling on his fatherrsquos chest.Hersquos enjoying his time lsquorestingrsquo from his day job of guiding people on challenging climbs of the Alpsrsquo highest peaks of Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn and the Eiger to spend time with his son.Depending on the mountain, he guides either one or two people up the peaks and safely down again.Paul explained: ldquoThe people who hire me are time poor but money rich. They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

The former linen warehouse on the Ormeau Road is one of Northern Ireland’s best-known cultural landmarks yet faces demolition to make way for a high-density apartment complexBelfast City Council has long had a contradictory attitude to the city’s built heritage.It boasts that Belfast’s streetscape is “a veritable storybook to rival any city in the UK or Ireland” while simultaneously allowing the removal of numerous pages through its support for developer-led regeneration.The problem with this approach is that it inevitably leads to the type of clash between heritage and commerce now faced by the council in relation to former Ulster Televisionheadquarters at Havelock House.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...An exterior picture of Havelock House, UTV, in , six years after the first broadcast from the studio there in Halloween The former linen warehouse on Belfast’s Ormeau Road is one of Northern Ireland’s best-known cultural landmarks yet faces demolition to make way for a high-density apartment complex. The proposal from Olympian Homes is highly likely to succeed because the failings of our planning system have allowed the developer and the council to maintain the legal fiction that the building has no heritage value.This position isn’t even remotely credible, given Havelock House’s integral role in the birth of Northern Ireland’s television industry, its indelible association with legendary local series such as Teatime with Tommy, Romper Room, Good Evening Ulster and Kelly and its status as the last surviving small station from the pioneering days of UK television.Features such as the original UTV studio, designed by local architect Brian Hewitt, are literally the nation’s last built record of the earliest days of television in regions such as Northern Ireland.The Queen meets UTV broadcasters including Paul Clarke during her visit to Havelock House as they launch their new HD station there in . Pic Colm Lenaghan PacemakerBut, despite its clear historical importance, nobody seems willing to protect a building which occupies a prime development site.There are two forms of protection available: full listed status, which can only be granted by the Department for Communities , and heritage asset status, which could be granted by Belfast City Council.The DfC has decided that Havelock House does not meet the criteria for a listing survey, the first step in the listing process. It reached this decision on the basis of a brief inspection of the building by officials in . Studio  inside Havelock House in the s with guests including Frank Carson, Gloria Hunnord and Rev David BurkeThe rationale behind its decision was never fully recorded. The fragments available suggest that the officials were not familiar with television architecture, leading them to make several inadvertent but decisive misinterpretations. The DfC has been aware of this issue for  months yet has remains unwilling to review its decision.Eventhere were a review, it is unlikely the DfC’s decision will change because its listing criteria are dominated by aesthetic considerations. This is exemplied by the protected status of the BBC’s Broadcasting House, which is an attractive building devoid of internal historical fabric. Dr Ken Grfin, a television historian and archivist whose doctoral thesis was on the history of Ulster TelevisionBy contrast, the DfC seems relaxed about the possible loss of Havelock House, a less attractive building with unique historical architecture.The absence of listed building status isn’t necessarily an issue because local authorities can designate heritage assets, buildings which don’t meet the national listing criteria but should still be protected on cultural and historical grounds.This author has been unable to find any instance where Belfast City Council has used this power. It’s also unlikely to do so in the future because its current draft development plan indicates that only listed buildings qualy as heritage assets, which defeats the purpose of that designation.The authorities’ inaction has not just left Havelock House exposed to demolition but it has reduced the public’s ability to scrutinise Olympian Homes’ demolition proposal. Without protection, the developers and Belfast’s planners have been able to maintain the fiction that Havelock House is a building devoid of historical value. This has allowed Olympian to submit a heritage statement which does not consider the historical or cultural impact of the building’s demolition. This is entirely legitimate as such statements are not required to disclose a development’s impact on unprotected structures.It has also allowed the developers to avoid the type of public consultation normally triggered by planning applications which entail the demolition of historically signicant buildings. Due to Havelock House’s unlisted status, Olympian could conduct a minimalistic consultation. It is impossible to assess the nature of Olympian’s consultation because the developer seems to have omitted its consultation report from its planning application. But it seems to have been poorly advertised – this author only became aware of the proposal by accident while, despite the development’s size, only a handful of objections have been received by the council to date.The developer’s decision to name its development ‘Havelock House’ in spite of the intended demolition of the eponymous building also seems to have sown confusion. My personal experience is that many people assume that the historic television station would be retained as part of the development.The affair of Havelock House might seem extraordinary but the sad fact is that such scenarios are not uncommon in our planning system.This has had a corrosive impact on public faith in the planning system: last month, a survey by Queen’s University found that % of people believe that Northern Ireland’s planning system does not serve the public interest.Barring a miracle, events on Belfast’s Ormeau Road are likely to only reinforce this view.• Dr Ken Grfin is a television historian and archivist whose doctoral thesis was on the history of Ulster Television.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh

who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

station president said the leboat was pushed by the crew along the seafront, which at the time wasnrsquot even one way.ldquoWe were as keen as mustard, pleased to be doing our bit for the community, but we had rudimentary equipment back then, he said.ldquoSome of our protective equipment was made by the local community.Crew member Karl Lawrence, with  yearsrsquo experience with the RNLI, said: ldquoThe best part of le-boating is working well as a team.ldquoWe maintain this team spirit by regularly exercising and training both ashore and afloat.ldquoSince opening our new station at the south end of the Esplanade we have installed a training room which is ideal for providing training in a warm, well-lit and stable room, prior to practicing on often rough seas in the leboats.ldquoMy favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again for service, we gather on our balcony drinking tea or coffee, watching the sun rise and exchanging with each other our plans for the day ahead, before most other people have woken up.Celebrating the success of the station, current leboat operations manager, Jason Dunlop said ldquoI am incredibly proud to celebrate the stationrsquos -year anniversary.ldquoIt is testament to the community of Penarth who have supported the leboats by providing volunteers, funds, and ongoing support.ldquoThis community effort over the past  years has saved  lives, we have rescued or aided  people and our leboats have launched on service  times.ldquoHundreds of volunteers have supported the RNLI and the station in this time.ldquoI would like to express my thanks to them all and their families.He added: ldquoIt makes no dferencethe role people have played is to crew the boats, to assist launch on shore, provide community safety advice, run our shops or fundraise, everyone plays a vital role in saving lives.ldquoThe RNLI is funded by donations and receives no government funding, soyou are a fundraiser, a member of our shop team, a local business who supports us or a member of the community who has donated or raised funds you have help us to save lives.ldquoWe are all one leboat crew and we are part of the community of Penarth.ldquoThe RNLI is built of the vision that ldquowith courage, nothing is impossible.ldquoI believe that the community of Penarth is a living example of this vision.ldquoAs we say in the RNLI, ldquofair winds and following seas.Leboat spokesman, Andy Berry has asked members the community to send stories and short video messages to awb.safety@gmail where they can be shared online.He said: ldquoMaybe yoursquove been directly involved in a rescue, or perhaps wersquove helped your friends and family  Or maybe you just have a nice story too share about our work or want to wish us well.ldquoWe would love to hear from you.The RNLI, like many charities is facing a funding crisis through the covid- crisis.Penarth RNLI has set up a JustGiving page to help raise monies to mark the th anniversary, with a target of pound.The Penarth Nationwide branch has

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acfcbbaebbbdbdbea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_faecacdfaebf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.
