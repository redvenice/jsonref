In 2015, she reportedly told the journalist Piers Morgan that she had not always sought showbusiness success.‘As a kid, I wanted to be either the president or a news broadcaster like you,’ she told him.          The actress married Prince Harry after meeting him in London in 2016. She has now become the Duchess of Sussex          Meghan Markle is expected to become a British citizen but she has harboured dreams of becoming President of the USMeghan is still a U.S. citizen because the process to become a fully-fledged Briton is expected to take three years. She is expected to retain her U.S. citizenship, as dual citizenship is permitted. Presidential candidates must be U.S. citizens.Meghan has cultivated a warm friendship with former U.S. president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, while chat show host Oprah Winfrey, who is one of the most influential women in America, was given a prime seat at St George’s Chapel Windsor, opposite the Royal Family.A royal historian says Meghan would find it difficult to enter U.S. politics while still married to Harry. ‘It is a pretty strong rule that members of the Royal Family keep out of politics,’ he says.Share this article    The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, leaving Windsor Castle after their weddingBut Harry could, of course, give up official royal duties. His mother, Princess Diana, was said to have considered moving to America.And the claim appears to have caused consternation at Kensington Palace yesterday, with the Duchess giving her official spokesman permission to take the unusual step of issuing a public denial.‘This conversation you describe with an associate is fictitious,’ the spokesman insisted.I am, though, not the only one to hear rumours that Meghan still holds political ambitions.Former Times editor Sir Simon Jenkins says: ‘Her friends and associates affirm that she is a political animal.‘Such is her fame, she could perfectly well follow a route taken by a certain Ronald Reagan. She might lead for the Democrats against a Republican Ivanka Trump. All I can say is, why not?’Meghan’s best friend is Jessica Mulroney, whose father-in-law, Brian, was prime minister of Canada for nine years.Meghan has strong political views and attacked Donald Trump in 2016 for being ‘isive’ and ‘misogynistic’. She might have to reach an accommodation with her new chum George Clooney, who is said to hold political ambitions of his own. Perhaps he could be her running mate."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/01/4C898F2700000578-5759713-Auctioning_under_the_name_ClaireOliver87_the_listing_included_th-a-28_1527035182950.jpg","title":"Official royal wedding gift bag sells 21 400 eBay","story":"    Included in the listing was a bottle of Windsor Castle spring water, a fridge magnet, an over-sized chocolate coin, a tin of shortbread biscuits, a spectator badge, a spectator wristband, a parking sticker, the order of service, a postcard, a map and day briefing, entry card letter and finally the tote bag itself          Auctioning under the name ClaireOliver87, the listing included the entire contents of the gift bag as well as the paperwork received on and prior to the dayThe guests arrived at 9am to see 600 VIPs including the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles as well as the Clooneys, the Beckhams, Elton John and Oprah Winfrey turn up for the A-list wedding of the decade. And as 120,000 well-wishers fought for space outside the castle these privileged 1,200 were able to get great views of the newlyweds as they kissed outside the chapel and paraded past in the royal Ascot Landau carriage. But within hours of the event finishing dozens of their free hessian gift bags were being auctioned off to the highest bidder.Many of the sellers had clearly planned to do it in advance because they photographed the items outside St George\u0027s Chapel to ensure they looked genuine on eBay.           Bids for items have now reached more than £1,000 even though they were handed out for free by Meghan and Harry  Guests invited by Meghan and Harry to see them marry are already cashing in by selling their gift bags on eBay for £400 or more          Guests arriving in the grounds of Windsor Castle passed tables where bags were handed out to each guest but some have taken advantage of this generosity          The canvas bags had the happy couple\u0027s initials on the side and are being sold on the promise buyers will be getting a piece of royal wedding historySo why WERE the Beckhams and Clooneys (not to mention Chloe...Why did George and Charlotte suddenly go missing?

So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s dateMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerSnake found battling giant centipede in VietnamKendrick Lamar stops white fan from rapping because she said n-wordHorrific moment Chinese boy is mauled by pit bull outside pet shopAnthony Hopkins stars in classic \u0027Remains of The Day\u0027 trailerHorrific moment three friends film themselves drowning in a pondCat clings onto the roof of a van driving at 60mphChelsea Flower Show garden highlights dangers of invasive plantsPolice share update on investigation into Ebby Steppach\u0027s deathGwyneth Paltrow says Brad Pitt confronted Weinstein on her behalfPrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/03/4C6D6BBD00000578-5760259-image-m-50_1527041809494.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles sister says Doria Ragland looked like hockey player penalty box","story":"Meghan Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Grant fired off a series of barbs at Doria Ragland.

However, players will be allowed to stay in the locker rooms The NFL has announced a new national anthem policy that requires all team personnel on the field to stand during The Star-Spangled Banner while allowing players the choice to remain in the locker room.\u0027This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,\u0027 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. \u0027Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.\u0027 Beginning in 2009, the NFL required that all players be on the field during the national anthem.Under the new rules, teams will be fined for any personnel on the field that fails to show what the league determines to be appropriate respect for the anthem. The teams are then free to fine their own personnel, including players, for protesting during the anthem. So while some teams could have a policy requiring everyone on the field to stand, other franchises could choose to pay the league fines while allowing its players to demonstrate during The Star-Spangled Banner. The decision would put inidual teams at the forefront of the ongoing controversy surrounding the peaceful demonstrations, which  are aimed at raising awareness about inequality and police brutality against minorities.            The controversial issue exploded two years ago after then-San Francisco 49ers QB Colin Kaepernick (center) refused to stand to protest inequality and police brutality          Currently, NFL regulations say that players \u0027should\u0027 stand for The Star-Spangled Banner\u0027It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic,\u0027 Goodell said. \u0027This is not and was never the case.\u0027 Initially, the NFL Players Association did not seem receptive to the policy changes. \u0027Maybe this new rule proposal that is being voted on is a compromise between the NFL office and club CEOs on various sides of the issue, but certainly not with player leadership,\u0027 wrote NFLPA spokesman George Atallah. \u0027We weren\u0027t there or part of the discussions.\u0027NFL is \u0027considering 15-yard penalties for teams who kneel...I\u0027ll pay the fine! Jets chairman says he WON\u0027T penalize...Share this articleThe NFLPA released an official statement Wednesday afternoon. \u0027The NFL chose to not consult the union in the development of this new policy,\u0027 read the statement. \u0027NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about.\u0027The vote by NFL club CEOs today contradicts the statements made to our player leadership by Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Chairman of the NFL’s Management Council John Mara about the principles, values and patriotism of our League.\u0027Our union will review the new policy and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement.\u0027According to an ESPN report, the idea had the support of \u0027at least 24 owners.\u0027 One objector, New York Jets chairman Christopher Johnson, told Newsday that he would pay the league\u0027s fine, but not fine any of his players that choose to protest during the anthem.          Prior to a game in September, the Dallas Cowboys took a knee before rising as a team to stand for the national anthem. Since then, owner Jerry Jones has vocally opposed the protests          Both Eric Reid (right) and Colin Kaepernick (center) have sued the NFL owners for collusion, accusing the league of retaliating against them for their peaceful demonstrations Kaepernick has not played since 2016 and filed a collusion case against NFL owners alleging a concerted effort was made to keep him out of football. Former teammate Eric Reid, a safety with the 49ers and unrestricted free agent, is following suit.Reid, who joined Kaepernick in kneeling to bring attention to social injustice, visited only one team - the Cincinnati Bengals - and was asked if he would continue to kneel during the anthem by team ownership.Kaepernick had a visit scheduled with the Seattle Seahawks - the only team to host Kaepernick in 2017 - but it was postponed because management wanted greater clarity on Kaepernick\u0027s intentions during pregame.NFL games remain among the most watched programming on television, but ratings took another significant dip during the 2017 regular season amidst the controversial protests.The average audience was 14.9 million viewers per game, down 9.7 percent from 16.5 million viewers in the 2016 regular season, according to Nielsen. The 2016 viewership was down eight percent from the previous year.          President Donald Trump congratulated NASCAR on its attitude toward the anthem However, NBC\u0027s Sunday Night Football remained the season\u0027s ratings king for the seventh straight year, according to Nielsen. That beats the previous record set by Fox\u0027s \u0027American Idol\u0027 between 2005-06 and 2010-11.  The Sunday Night football games averaged 18.2 million TV viewers in 2017, a 29 percent margin over the runner-up: CBS\u0027s \u0027Thursday Night Football\u0027 On Monday, when welcoming stock car driver Martin Truex Jr. and his team to the White House, Trump again raised the topic of anthem protests. \u0027One thing I love about NASCAR is they do indeed stand for the playing of the National Anthem. They do indeed,\u0027 Trump said.\u0027Somebody said maybe you shouldn\u0027t say that, it\u0027ll be controversial and I said that\u0027s okay, NASCAR\u0027s not going to mind it at all. Right fellas? They don\u0027t mind it at all,\u0027 Trump added.Despite the President\u0027s enthusiasm for NASCAR and its attitude towards the national anthem, the sport\u0027s ratings have plummeted around 28 percent over the last two years, according to Forbes.           NFL commissioner Roger Goodell believes the league\u0027s new policy will put the focus back on the game and alleviate the controversy over the player protests The policy adopted today was approved in concert with the NFL\u0027s ongoing commitment to local communities and our country - one that is extraordinary in its scope, resources, and alignment with our players. We are dedicated to continuing our collaboration with players to advance the goals of justice and fairness in all corners of our society.The efforts by many of our players sparked awareness and action around issues of social justice that must be addressed. The platform that we have created together is certainly unique in professional sports and quite likely in American business. We are honored to work with our players to drive progress.It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic. This is not and was never the case.This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem. Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.We believe today\u0027s decision will keep our focus on the game and the extraordinary athletes who play it - and on our fans who enjoy it.POLICY STATEMENTThe 32 member clubs of the National Football League have reaffirmed their strong commitment to work alongside our players to strengthen our communities and advance social justice. The unique platform that we have created is unprecedented in its scope, and will provide extraordinary resources in support of programs to promote positive social change in our communities.The membership also strongly believes that:All team and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.The Game Operations Manual will be revised to remove the requirement that all players be on the field for the Anthem.Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room or in a similar location off the field until after the Anthem has been performed.A club will be fined by the League if its personnel are on the field and do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.Each club may develop its own work rules, consistent with the above principles, regarding its personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.The Commissioner will impose appropriate discipline on league personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.        (source: NFL.com)                                                     NFL owners expected to approve new national anthem policyDetroit Lions president Rod Wood: NFL must get anthem issue \u0027resolved\u0027Roger Goodell\u0027s statement on national anthem policy - NFL.comJets chairman Christopher Johnson says he’ll pay anthem-related league fines for his players | Newsday"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/19/248129A400000578-5763309-image-a-41_1527100381226.jpg","title":"Tesco ban non recyclable packaging brand products","story":"PVC wrapping on supermarket foods, polystyrene pizza bases and yoghurt pots are to be pulled from shelves in a new attack on \u0027plastic poison\u0027.

We are challenging all supermarkets to reduce their single-use plastic footprints in the shortest time possible, and in the meantime they should pull out all the stops to remove unnecessary and non-recyclable plastic packaging by 2019. \u0027Now we know what it\u0027s doing to our oceans, it simply has to go.\u0027 Details of the Tesco plan were revealed by Chief Product Officer, Jason Tarry, who was speaking to hundreds of suppliers at an event organised by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IDG) yesterday. As well as replacing plastic, Tesco is campaigning for the UK to adopt a so-called \u0027closed loop system\u0027 on packaging where everything that is used is collected and recycled, The Grocer reported.It said this will require the Government and local councils to set up a uniform recycling system across UK, replacing the current regime where there are \u0027extreme\u0027 differences in the materials that are collected between towns.Mr Tarry said: \u0027We are committed to reducing the total amount of packaging used across our business. Ideally we would like to move to a closed loop system.\u0027We will work with our suppliers to redesign and reduce all packaging materials and after consultation with our leading suppliers earlier this year we will remove all packaging that is hard to recycle from our business by 2019.\u0027To complete the journey to a closed loop approach, we stand ready to work with government to reform the current approach to recycling in the UK.\u0027Tesco steps up war on plastic with packaging ban"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/23/4C917A5600000578-5763679-image-a-1_1527115692167.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment kitten sees reflection mirror time","story":"    This is the hilarious moment a cat saw its reflection in the mirror for the first time in its life          Oscar the cat could not understand why there was another cat staring back at himFilmed at the home of the owner\u0027s friends in London, this video shows Oscar - a Russian Blue - seemingly determined to work out what\u0027s going on as he looks in the mirror for the first time.At one point, confused Oscar even tries to take a look behind the mirror to work out what\u0027s going on.But Oscar settles into his stride and beings to interact playfully with his reflection.Just like David Attenborough?

Best for Britain was launched last April ahead of the snap general election. It was fronted by Gina Miller (pictured), who took the Government to court over Brexit\u0027Those MPs who are seeking to dilute or delay Brexit must now admit that their meaningful vote is really just their plan to stop Brexit – as this document sets out unambiguously.\u0027Richard Tice, of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, said: \u0027George Soros, the billionaire who does not live in the UK, will stop at nothing with his elitist friends to stop Brexit, deceitfully masking their plans as a people\u0027s vote. \u0027Shamefully, they want to deny the poorest in our society from benefiting the most from Brexit.\u0027Best for Britain was launched last April ahead of the snap general election. It was fronted by Gina Miller, who took the Government to court over Brexit, but she quit earlier this year after becoming uncomfortable with the group\u0027s tactics.It emerged in February that Best for Britain had accepted a £400,000 donation from Mr Soros, the Hungarian-born financier who bet against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 – earning him one billion dollars.           Pictured: Best for Britain boss Gina Miller pictured in central London in May last year He then promised £100,000 more, matching a crowdfunding push, and later gave another £300,000.Board members include Lord Malloch-Brown, who was a foreign minister under Gordon Brown, and chief executive Eloise Todd, who worked in Brussels for Bono\u0027s charity ONE.When the campaign was founded, its backers claimed they respected the result of the EU referendum. But it has been putting up billboards around the country calling for a second vote and the document says its strategic goals include: \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 and \u0027win a people\u0027s vote to stay and lead in Europe\u0027.It sets out a three-pronged strategy to persuade \u0027soft\u0027 Leave voters to change their minds, mobilise hardline Remainers into action, and shift the Labour Party into an anti-Brexit stance.Best for Britain says it will \u0027attach our case to the big non-Brexit issues that have emotional resonance – we need to break out from the Brexit bubble\u0027. Using social media, it wants \u0027reach out to where people are engaged – physically but mostly digitally\u0027. It also pledges to \u0027cut through by being bold and embracing the disruptive\u0027.          Former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson (pictured) said a document reveals how far some Remainers would go to overturn the result of the referendum of June 2016In the next few weeks Best for Britain will start arguing the Brexit referendum was not a rejection of the EU: \u0027This was a vote against London as much as Brussels.\u0027Over the summer, its message will focus on how Brexit is \u0027putting the UK\u0027s unity and security at risk\u0027. In October – when it is expected that the outline of the Prime Minister\u0027s deal with Brussels will be known – the document reveals that the group has already decided to argue: \u0027Now we can finally see the real facts, this is not what we voted for.\u0027Best for Britain activists are instructed to \u0027survey local issues and concerns and link these to impact of Brexit\u0027.They started with grassroots events for constituency Labour parties earlier this month, with plans to start work on \u0027mobilising the unions\u0027 in the next fortnight.In July, the group is planning to lobby the policy conference of Unite, the country\u0027s largest trade union. In August, it is organising a \u0027Labour Against Brexit\u0027 speaking tour that will see senior figures make the case for remaining in the EU.          In September it will have a presence at both the TUC and Labour Party annual conferences.When MPs return to Parliament after party conference season, it is planning to bring hundreds of activists to London to confront them.

A new count has found the puffin population on some islands has halvedIt described the initial results as ‘alarming’ and said if the trend is replicated in the coming years, puffins could have ‘completely died out’ on the Farne Islands in 50 to 100 years.The last count five years ago recorded almost 40,000 breeding pairs of the birds.The Beast from the East brought freezing temperatures and blizzards off the North East coast at the end of February.          A lone puffin on Skellig Michael in Ireland. The species has been  devastated by severe weather in England which has wiped out almost half of some colonies           Severe weather including the Beast from the East has been blamed for the puffin population crisis on Northumberland’s Farne IslandsGwen Potter, a countryside manager for the National Trust in Northumberland, said: ‘We’ve had a very harsh winter and increased frequency of stormy seas means it’s harder for puffins to forage.’ Puffins, who spend winter out at sea, have been four weeks later than usual returning to the islands this year, which the trust believes is due to the weather.Miss Potter said the severe weather is due to climate change. This affects the puffin’s main food source, sand eels, which move further north to find colder seas. Rangers, who live on the islands from March to December, say they have noticed some puffins are ‘skinny’, which could affect egg production and numbers of pufflings. They have also found dead puffins and seals wrapped in plastic. Tom Hendry, a National Trust ranger, said it will have a ‘much clearer picture’ of the puffin population when the count is complete in June.The National Trust wants to increase the frequency of puffin counts to annually from once every five years ‘to help discover the true picture and track numbers against likely causes of population change’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/00/4C9211A200000578-0-image-m-44_1527119585274.jpg","title":"Parliament set debate sweeping reforms House Lords","story":"Parliament is to debate sweeping reforms of the House of Lords next month amid rising concern that peers have overstepped the mark in their opposition to BrexitHe added: ‘The Government is delivering on the decision made by the country in the referendum to leave the EU and will not accept attempts to stop this.‘Some of the amendments do not respect the purpose of the Bill, which is to give certainty to leave the EU by transferring EU law into UK law.

But figures last week showed the NHS had lost 1,300 GPs since 2015 because more are leaving than are being recruited. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard of the Royal College of GPs said: \u0027The pressures GPs and our teams are working under are unsustainable. Our workload has escalated in volume and complexity in recent years but investment in our profession is less than a decade ago.\u0027Patient, 61, wakes up from operation to find surgeon has...\u0027Cowardly\u0027 traffic warden is slammed for slapping a FUNERAL...Share this articleIn surgeries which impose restrictions, patients can still make an emergency or same-day appointment, but only if they are seriously ill. They are usually assessed over the phone in a \u0027triage\u0027 process by a doctor or sometimes a receptionist who will assess the severity of their condition.Dr Richard Vautrey, head of the British Medical Association\u0027s GP committee said: \u0027This is further evidence of the pressures practices are under, with growing demands for appointments not being matched with an ability to provide them due to the continuing recruitment and retention crisis in general practice. Over recent years the number of consultations has been steadily rising while the GP workforce has been declining.\u0027Surgeries are now left in the position where telephone triage is the only method by which staff are able to handle this demand in a safe manner. But this can result in increased stress for many GPs as they try to manage so many patients each day.\u0027          In the survey of 769 GPs, 16.5 per cent said they had been forced to temporarily cancel routine appointments in the previous 12 monthsIn Workington, Cumbria, GP Dr Jennifer Lyall said her own practice had been forced to resort to a telephone triage system at one point.\u0027This was due to lack of GPs,\u0027 she explained. \u0027We had only two permanent GPs for a 7,000-patient practice.\u0027 Dr Peter Lewis, who had to take similar measures in Leeds, said: \u0027The reason was a combination of a failure to recruit partners and it was school holidays, so the partners here were already committed to holidays abroad,\u0027 he said. What\u0027s more there was \u0027no chance\u0027 of getting locum coverage during the holidays.Dr Martin Tant, from Alford, Lincolnshire, said his surgery stopped allowing patients to make routine appointments because they were fully booked for a month.\u0027We ran out of appointments,\u0027 he said.The shortage of doctors is also driving up waiting times and a Mail-commissioned survey in April found that half of patients could not get an appointment within a week.Some said they had to wait between three or four weeks and several said they had gone privately instead."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/00/065F52DC000003E8-0-image-m-34_1527118407439.jpg","title":"Lord Speaker Norman Fowler better value MPs","story":"    Norman Fowler: \u0027The process of reduction is now under way – and I should emphasise that this is being done without the benefit of Government legislation, but rather by peers themselves. The size of the House is now falling and will continue to fall\u0027Yesterday’s Daily Mail reported a poll which it said suggested that the House of Lords was outdated, outsized and out of touch with the British public. Let me set out five short reasons why I do not believe the House of Lords should be discarded in this way.First, the Daily Mail poll suggests that seven in ten voters believe there should be fewer peers than the current 780. I totally agree. That is why I set up a special committee under Terry Burns to propose how we could reduce it.They suggested an overall cap of 600 members, not to be exceeded, and limited terms of service for new peers. In a debate last December, the Lords itself endorsed that report. The process of reduction is now under way – and I should emphasise that this is being done without the benefit of Government legislation, but rather by peers themselves. The size of the House is now falling and will continue to fall.Second, it is ludicrously unjust to characterise peers as ‘dinosaurs in ermine’. We may have an older membership than the House of Commons but with age comes experience and we have acknowledged experts in virtually every area and a far greater level of expertise than any other senate I know of in the world.Parliament set to debate sweeping reforms of the House of...The dotty grandees are gone... peers are just bland blobs...Share this articleIn defence we have distinguished military leaders like Alan West, the former First Sea Lord, Richard Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff and Jock Stirrup from the RAF, who was also Chief of the Defence Staff. Or if we take health, we have figures like Robert Winston and Ara Darzi.In the law, we have former Lord Chief Justices like Igor Judge and John Thomas. Among the historians and broadcasters, we have Peter Hennessy, Joan Bakewell and Melvyn Bragg. For obvious reasons, the depth of knowledge here vastly exceeds anything available in the younger House of Commons.  \u0027With age comes experience and we have acknowledged experts in virtually every area. We have distinguished military leaders like Alan West, the former First Sea Lord, Richard Dannatt (left), the former Chief of the General Staff and Jock Stirrup from the RAF, who was also Chief of the Defence Staff. Or if we take health, we have figures like Robert Winston (right) and Ara Darzi\u0027Third, there has been criticism of the House for pressing amendments on the Brexit Bill, but this ignores the fact that the final decision on all these amendments rests with the Commons – the elected chamber. Our only power is to ask the Commons to consider again. It would be odd if this Bill – of profound importance – was the only Bill which escaped such scrutiny.It should be added that of the 201 amendments which were made to the Bill in the House of Lords, 178 of them were proposed by the Government, again underlining the importance of the Second Chamber in improving legislation.Fourth, the vast majority of peers are hardworking and honest. I in no way defend anyone who has been shown to abuse the allowances system. I will refer any substantive complaint to the Commissioner for Standards for independent investigation.As for the £305 allowance itself, you might remember that the many peers who live outside London require either a hotel room or lodgings for the night, and have to meet this expense and any secretarial expenses out of this flat allowance. Everyone who claims has to sign a declaration that they have undertaken genuine parliamentary work.Fifth, on the question of cost, the overall cost of the Lords is approximately £100million a year, compared with the Commons which is over £200million a year.Moreover, the annual cost of each member based on the average allowances claimed is £22,000 a year, less than a third of an MP’s salary, let alone their additional expenses.The Lords cannot simply be written off as enemies of the referendum or enemies of Brexit – there are many views in the House on those subjects as there are on a range of issues. I was in the House of Commons for over 30 years and I cannot recall ever hearing calls for its abolition on the grounds that members held views which were considered out of step.We are a strong enough parliamentary democracy to permit differences of view, honestly held – particularly with the safeguard that the final decision rests with elected MPs."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/01/4C920C9000000578-0-image-m-13_1527120175960.jpg","title":"Loophole allows Ofsted outstanding schools avoid inspections 10 years","story":"    Some outstanding schools have escaped Ofsted inspections for the past 10 years           The loophole has allowed 1,620 schools to avoid inspection for more than six yearsThe aim is to let high-flying schools concentrate on teaching without having to worry about inspections.But the NAO’s audit of Ofsted found that 1,620 schools had not been inspected for six years or more, including 296 which have gone without for more than a decade and a small number for up to 13 years.Now Ofsted itself wants an end to the exemption because it lets schools avoid inspection forever if they stay below the radar after an ‘outstanding’ rating.British family car that drives itself but won\u0027t cost the...Share this articleDirector of corporate strategy Luke Tryl said some schools may now have slipped to ‘middling’, adding: ‘We don’t think the exemption is sustainable. It is one of the biggest factors undermining confidence in the reliability of our judgements.’Ofsted is unable to close the loophole by itself and is lobbying for a change in the relevant law so inspectors would visit outstanding primaries every six years and secondaries every five to seven years.The NAO findings also raise the prospect of some ‘outstanding’ schools failing Ofsted’s new ‘British Values’ criteria.Under rules introduced after the ‘Trojan Horse’ Islamic extremism scare, all schools must teach gender equality, tolerance of gay people and respect for democracy.The report also found Ofsted was missing inspection targets amid high staff turnover and falling budgets – the watchdog spent 52 per cent less in real terms in 2017-18 than it did in 1999-2000.Ofsted says that at the turn of the millennium, a team of 16 to 17 inspectors would go into secondary schools for a whole week every six or seven years. Now a ‘good’ school gets two inspectors for one day every four years.

We are challenging all supermarkets to reduce their single-use plastic footprints in the shortest time possible, and in the meantime they should pull out all the stops to remove unnecessary and non-recyclable plastic packaging by 2019. \u0027Now we know what it\u0027s doing to our oceans, it simply has to go.\u0027 Details of the Tesco plan were revealed by Chief Product Officer, Jason Tarry, who was speaking to hundreds of suppliers at an event organised by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IDG) yesterday. As well as replacing plastic, Tesco is campaigning for the UK to adopt a so-called \u0027closed loop system\u0027 on packaging where everything that is used is collected and recycled, The Grocer reported.It said this will require the Government and local councils to set up a uniform recycling system across UK, replacing the current regime where there are \u0027extreme\u0027 differences in the materials that are collected between towns.Mr Tarry said: \u0027We are committed to reducing the total amount of packaging used across our business. Ideally we would like to move to a closed loop system.\u0027We will work with our suppliers to redesign and reduce all packaging materials and after consultation with our leading suppliers earlier this year we will remove all packaging that is hard to recycle from our business by 2019.\u0027To complete the journey to a closed loop approach, we stand ready to work with government to reform the current approach to recycling in the UK.\u0027Tesco steps up war on plastic with packaging ban"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/23/4C917A5600000578-5763679-image-a-1_1527115692167.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment kitten sees reflection mirror time","story":"    This is the hilarious moment a cat saw its reflection in the mirror for the first time in its life          Oscar the cat could not understand why there was another cat staring back at himFilmed at the home of the owner\u0027s friends in London, this video shows Oscar - a Russian Blue - seemingly determined to work out what\u0027s going on as he looks in the mirror for the first time.At one point, confused Oscar even tries to take a look behind the mirror to work out what\u0027s going on.But Oscar settles into his stride and beings to interact playfully with his reflection.Just like David Attenborough?

It was fronted by Gina Miller (pictured), who took the Government to court over Brexit\u0027Those MPs who are seeking to dilute or delay Brexit must now admit that their meaningful vote is really just their plan to stop Brexit – as this document sets out unambiguously.\u0027Richard Tice, of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, said: \u0027George Soros, the billionaire who does not live in the UK, will stop at nothing with his elitist friends to stop Brexit, deceitfully masking their plans as a people\u0027s vote. \u0027Shamefully, they want to deny the poorest in our society from benefiting the most from Brexit.\u0027Best for Britain was launched last April ahead of the snap general election. It was fronted by Gina Miller, who took the Government to court over Brexit, but she quit earlier this year after becoming uncomfortable with the group\u0027s tactics.It emerged in February that Best for Britain had accepted a £400,000 donation from Mr Soros, the Hungarian-born financier who bet against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 – earning him one billion dollars.           Pictured: Best for Britain boss Gina Miller pictured in central London in May last year He then promised £100,000 more, matching a crowdfunding push, and later gave another £300,000.Board members include Lord Malloch-Brown, who was a foreign minister under Gordon Brown, and chief executive Eloise Todd, who worked in Brussels for Bono\u0027s charity ONE.When the campaign was founded, its backers claimed they respected the result of the EU referendum. But it has been putting up billboards around the country calling for a second vote and the document says its strategic goals include: \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 and \u0027win a people\u0027s vote to stay and lead in Europe\u0027.It sets out a three-pronged strategy to persuade \u0027soft\u0027 Leave voters to change their minds, mobilise hardline Remainers into action, and shift the Labour Party into an anti-Brexit stance.Best for Britain says it will \u0027attach our case to the big non-Brexit issues that have emotional resonance – we need to break out from the Brexit bubble\u0027. Using social media, it wants \u0027reach out to where people are engaged – physically but mostly digitally\u0027. It also pledges to \u0027cut through by being bold and embracing the disruptive\u0027.          Former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson (pictured) said a document reveals how far some Remainers would go to overturn the result of the referendum of June 2016In the next few weeks Best for Britain will start arguing the Brexit referendum was not a rejection of the EU: \u0027This was a vote against London as much as Brussels.\u0027Over the summer, its message will focus on how Brexit is \u0027putting the UK\u0027s unity and security at risk\u0027. In October – when it is expected that the outline of the Prime Minister\u0027s deal with Brussels will be known – the document reveals that the group has already decided to argue: \u0027Now we can finally see the real facts, this is not what we voted for.\u0027Best for Britain activists are instructed to \u0027survey local issues and concerns and link these to impact of Brexit\u0027.They started with grassroots events for constituency Labour parties earlier this month, with plans to start work on \u0027mobilising the unions\u0027 in the next fortnight.In July, the group is planning to lobby the policy conference of Unite, the country\u0027s largest trade union. In August, it is organising a \u0027Labour Against Brexit\u0027 speaking tour that will see senior figures make the case for remaining in the EU.          In September it will have a presence at both the TUC and Labour Party annual conferences.When MPs return to Parliament after party conference season, it is planning to bring hundreds of activists to London to confront them. The document says: \u0027We\u0027ve raised £2.4million, we need another £3.2million. \u0027Our activity is essentially scalable – how many we reach is directly proportional to what we can spend.\u0027A Best for Britain spokesman said: \u0027We have never hidden our agenda.

A new count has found the puffin population on some islands has halvedIt described the initial results as ‘alarming’ and said if the trend is replicated in the coming years, puffins could have ‘completely died out’ on the Farne Islands in 50 to 100 years.The last count five years ago recorded almost 40,000 breeding pairs of the birds.The Beast from the East brought freezing temperatures and blizzards off the North East coast at the end of February.          A lone puffin on Skellig Michael in Ireland. The species has been  devastated by severe weather in England which has wiped out almost half of some colonies           Severe weather including the Beast from the East has been blamed for the puffin population crisis on Northumberland’s Farne IslandsGwen Potter, a countryside manager for the National Trust in Northumberland, said: ‘We’ve had a very harsh winter and increased frequency of stormy seas means it’s harder for puffins to forage.’ Puffins, who spend winter out at sea, have been four weeks later than usual returning to the islands this year, which the trust believes is due to the weather.Miss Potter said the severe weather is due to climate change. This affects the puffin’s main food source, sand eels, which move further north to find colder seas. Rangers, who live on the islands from March to December, say they have noticed some puffins are ‘skinny’, which could affect egg production and numbers of pufflings. They have also found dead puffins and seals wrapped in plastic. Tom Hendry, a National Trust ranger, said it will have a ‘much clearer picture’ of the puffin population when the count is complete in June.The National Trust wants to increase the frequency of puffin counts to annually from once every five years ‘to help discover the true picture and track numbers against likely causes of population change’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/00/4C9211A200000578-0-image-m-44_1527119585274.jpg","title":"Parliament set debate sweeping reforms House Lords","story":"Parliament is to debate sweeping reforms of the House of Lords next month amid rising concern that peers have overstepped the mark in their opposition to BrexitHe added: ‘The Government is delivering on the decision made by the country in the referendum to leave the EU and will not accept attempts to stop this.‘Some of the amendments do not respect the purpose of the Bill, which is to give certainty to leave the EU by transferring EU law into UK law.

Set in the near future, the book focuses on the teenage Colt and his mother, a geneticist named Naomi Chiang who has discovered a potent alternative to stem cell therapies. Based on the imaginal discs that are instrumental to insect metamorphosis, Naomi’s technique, if developed, could allow complex body parts – and even brain tissue – to be rapidly regrown. Colt, who spends much of his time immersed in a virtual game world, is affected by a condition that resembles Asperger’s syndrome. Pinocchio-like, he wants to be a “real boy”, and sees that promise in his mother’s work.Distrusting her own findings, Naomi has been reluctant to publish them, but her research has already attracted attention. The National Security Agency, now entirely delinquent and vastly powerful, has spotted its military potential and wants it suppressed. When Colt persuades Naomi to give a conference paper, the two are promptly apprehended and, in time-honoured fashion, whisked away to a secret base in Nevada.Colt, however, has been busy. He has stolen into Naomi’s lab, intent on engineering a neurotypical brain, and injected himself with an untested imaginal disc. “But … why?” she asks him. Colt hedges a little, then confesses: “I could talk to … to women, Mama.”It is a touching scene, and no less so for its playful deference to superhero origin stories. And as tradition requires, Colt soon finds he has been granted not just the abilities he coveted, but lots more besides: his brain is now stuffed with an outsize corpus callosum (a structure implicated in autism spectrum disorders) as well as an intricate tissue of upgrades generated from insect neurons. These enable him to escape from the NSA’s desert fortress, to keep ahead of the ensuing manhunt and to confront the “immune system”, a terrifying digital panopticon developed (in a pleasing Oedipal flourish) by his own father.These episodes are propulsive and engrossing, but life with the newly enhanced Colt isn’t all fun and games. To begin with, his condition is not in any sense “cured” – that would be inconsistent with Gough’s sophisticated and sympathetic presentation of autism. Far from exploiting it as a narrative contrivance, as other novelists have repeatedly done, he is at pains to show us the richness and complexity of experience of the atypical brain.This approach is clearly commendable, and the resulting portrait is – up to a point – illuminating and inclusive. The problem, for narrative purposes, is that the supercharged Colt becomes a singular prototype, acquiring cognitive abilities so dazzling that at first he is literally blinded. Gough has a great deal of fun with this, and for a time so do we, but as Colt’s abilities grow, he struggles to explain them to lesser mortals. When he predicts a violent eruption of solar activity, his father is intrigued, but Colt is by now reduced to using an impatient shorthand. “The math isn’t up to the job,” he explains. “But I can see it in my head.”This, too, is a familiar trope. In fiction as in film, unchecked superpowers tend to alienate the audience (superheroes have human alter egos for a reason) and to rob the drama before us of a necessary friction. Much of the remaining conflict is between an implacable artificial intelligence and Colt’s own hypertrophied intellect, and although he suffers setbacks – and faces a final challenge that requires a uniquely human solution – it is a contest largely devoid of emotional interest.What we are left with amounts to a frenetic livestream from Colt’s prodigious consciousness, relieved only by hyperactive digressions on everything from particle physics to cryptography, strange authorial intrusions and an onerous ballast of epigraphs (we don’t need constant interruptions from Bertrand Russell or Ray Kurzweil to appreciate the extent and eclecticism of Gough’s reading).Yet for all its helpless excitability, there is plenty of real excitement in this novel, and a spirit of joyous curiosity that may strain our patience at times but never quite loses its charm. What Gough attempts here is to describe everything at every level, and the effort is in many ways hugely admirable. But fiction subsists on human experience, and it is better, as Colt reminds us, to describe things at the level at which they make most sense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1faef52037b19b82e91f2cfd44fbb89d755a6126/0_147_2452_1471/master/2452.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b23129f24d0b65c9cef62872f85a5227","title":"deutsche bank slash 7000 jobs city markets ftse sterling business live","story":"German investment bank faces angry shareholders after announcing a wide-ranging restructuring that could hit the City hardToday’s job cuts mean that Deutsche Bank is abandoning its goal of competing directly with America’s investment banking giants, says Associated Press:New CEO Christian Sewing has said the bank would refocus on its European and German customer base and cut back on costlier and riskier operations where it doesn’t hold a leading position. Sewing said the bank was committed to its international investment banking operations but must “concentrate on what we truly do well.”The new strategy means stepping back from several decades of global expansion in which the bank sought to compete with Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase.Sewing also warns shareholders that trading conditions remain tough, as it starts to cull workers.The Axeman Cometh, as CEO Christian Sewing starts to address Deutsche Bank’s AGM in Frankfurt.On today’s huge job cuts, Sewing says it is “a difficult situation” but Deutsche’s current financial position leaves him with “no choice”.We need to lay the basis for long-term profitability.Our long-term goal is to put Deutsche Bank back at the centre of society, adds Sewing, a little enigmatically.Newsflash: Back in the UK, retail sales have surged as shoppers returned to the high street last month.Encouraging news for the economy, and has sent the pound jumping by half a cent to $1.34 (away from yesterday’s five-month low).However, sales have barely risen over the last three months, suggesting British consumers remain cautious and cash-strapped.Rob Kent-Smith, Head of National Accounts says:“Increases were seen across all sectors in April, except department stores. Department stores declined following relatively strong sales last month, when their online sales were boosted during the adverse weather.Over the longer-term, retail sales growth has slowed considerably, with increases in food, household goods and internet retailers being largely offset by declines across all other types of retailing.”Here’s our news story on Deutsche’s job cuts:Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender, is to cut more than 7,000 jobs globally, with its investment banking business in London likely to be hit.Deutsche said one in four jobs in its equities sales and trading business would be axed. The bank’s global headcount is expected to fall from just over 97,000 to well below 90,000. The firm said it would not provide a breakdown at this stage but that all regions will be affected.Deutsche’s largest investment banking operation is based in the City of London. It employs about 8,500 people in the UK – mostly in London, with smaller operations in Birmingham and Bournemouth – and is one of the largest employers in the City.The news came a few hours before the group’s annual shareholder meeting in Frankfurt, due to start at 9am London time, where the group is expected to face a protest from shareholders over its poor performance.Deutsche’s new chief executive, Christian Sewing, said: “We remain committed to our corporate and investment bank and our international presence – we are unwavering in that … However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well.”When Sewing, the former co-head of the bank’s retail banking arm, was appointed to replace his British predecessor, John Cryan, in April, he vowed to take “tough decisions” to return the bank to profitability.Deutsche has suffered three years of losses and Cryan had been criticised for being too slow in pushing through cost-cutting measures.Paul Achleitner is now claiming that Deutsche’s board should be praised for handing back some bonuses, in recognition of the problems at the bank.Achleitner reminds the AGM that eleven executives who served during the financial crisis agreed to wave €38.4m of bonuses, even though an internal investigation found that no-one could be held personally responsible for Deutsche mistakes.Chairman Achleitner is trying to refute claims that he botched the change of CEO last month.He insist that Christian Sewing (who has worked at Deutsche Bank) is the right man to lead the company, rather than a heavy-hitting external candidate. Achleitner says Sewing is the right man, because he is a Deutsche man.Christian Sewing is our first choice..... He is Deutsche Bank through and through.True, but this hasn’t prevented Sewing from deciding to lay off thousands of fellow Deutsche workers today. And it won’t please critics who argue that Deutsche needs fresh blood.Deutsche Bank’s AGM is getting underway in Frankfurt.Chairman Paul Achleitner is getting his defence in early, telling shareholders that he hadn’t planned to oust CEO John Cryan last month - but was forced to act due to a leak.We had to act - even though it wasn’t originally our intention to make our change so swiftly.Personally I had hoped that the reshuffle at the top of our bank would be made in a constructive spirit at today’s annual general meeting.”He adds that Deutsche’s management had failed to show sufficient discipline when sticking to strategy plans over the last year.This led to last year’s disappointing loss (the third in a row), forcing the supervisory board to reshuffle its top team.Achleitner is now berating those who leaked details of the reshuffle over Easter - this damaged the bank, and forced the early appointment of Christian Sewing to replace CEO John Cryan.No wonder Deutsche’s shareholders are angry - the bank’s value has slumped by a third in the last year.Dr. Hans-Christoph Hirt of Hermes Investment Management, a Deutsche Bank shareholder, blames chairman Paul Achleitner for the company’s woes.Hirt tells Bloomberg TV that Achleitner has failed in three ways:These are all important responsibilities for a chairman, Hirt says, adding:In our opinion, he hasn’t done a particularly good job.However, Hermes won’t support today’s no-confidence vote, as it believes Deutsche doesn’t need any more disruption.We will give him one last warning - saying you need to do better, you are in the last-chance house.Protesters have gathered outside Deutsche Bank’s AGM in Frankfurt.They are calling on the bank to “get out of coal, weapons and tax havens”, with a sign reading “Deutsche Bank: Ich krieg die Krise’ (literally,” I’m getting the crisis”).Angry investors will try to oust Deutsche Bank’s chairman, Paul Achleitner, at its AGM today.Achleitner is under fire for failing to stop Deutsche’s track record of underperformance in recent years, and for a series of strategic zig-zags that have left shareholders dizzy.He now faces a vote of no-confidence from investors who believe his time is up.Achleitner made his name selling East German government assets following reunification in 1990. He has been chairman of Deutsche since 2012 - a time in which Deutsche has struggled to shake off the legacy of the financial crisis.Mr. Achleitner left Allianz in 2012 to become chairman of Deutsche Bank, overseeing the executives who run the company on a day-to-day basis.Deutsche Bank had grave problems. The culture was toxic. Large swaths of the business were poorly managed. Risks were not controlled. The bank had a tendency to needlessly antagonize regulators. It was caught up in just about all of the industry’s worst scandals: rigging interest rates, selling toxic mortgages, laundering money, violating sanctions.Rivals like UBS and Credit Suisse scaled back their investment banks in the wake of the financial crisis. But Deutsche Bank, with Mr. Achleitner’s backing, continued to try to play in the Wall Street big leagues.Mr. Achleitner insisted that Europe needed a counterweight to the big American investment banks. “If we don’t watch out,” he said in an interview with a German magazine in May 2015, “we’ll have the same American dominance that we already have in the internet.”Postbank, which is Deutsche Bank’s consumer banking unit, faces heavy job losses under today’s restructuring plan.Last night, the Financial Times reported that workers in the US and the City are also at risk:The person familiar with the bank’s plans said that the 10,000 jobs included “a few thousand jobs” at Deutsche’s German retail ision Postbank, which were already earmarked to be culled.The Wall Street Journal first reported the plans on Wednesday.Roughly half of the additional job cuts would be taking place in the group’s struggling investment bank, he added. “Most of the cuts will happen in the US, but London will see the axe too.”Deutsche is trying to convince investors that it’s serious about returning to profitability after three years of losses, says the AFP newswire.The bank said it would slash leverage exposure in the investment bank by 10 percent of “the €1,050bn of leverage exposure reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.” A Deutsche Bank spokesperson says that today’s job cuts will affect ‘all regions’, but they won’t give a detailed breakdown.However, it seems certain that the UK will be hit, as Deutsche’s biggest investment banking office is in the heart of London’s Square Mile.Deutsche employs 8,500 people in the UK, making it one of the biggest employers in the City.Deutsche Bank chooses to base its largest investment banking operations in the City of London, a centre of global flows of trade and wealth. We use this position as a global bank to keep our UK clients connected to markets, and help clients do business all over the world.It also has offices in Birmingham and Bournemouth.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Deutsche Bank has sent a shiver through the City by announcing that it plans to lay off thousands of staff worldwide.German’s biggest bank plans to cut its headcount to ‘well below’ 90,000, from 97,000 today, as it shake up its corporate and investment banking operations. The number of full-time equivalent positions is expected to fall from just over 97,000 currently to well below 90,000. The associated personnel reductions are underway.The move follows rising investor anger over Deutsche’s performance - the bank has posted three annual losses in a row, and sacked CEO John Cryan last month.Cryan’s successor, Christian Sewing, had pledged to cut back on risk operations and refocus on Europe - and he’s now wielding the axe.“We remain committed to our Corporate \u0026amp Investment Bank and our international presence, we are unwavering in that....However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well.” The announcement comes just a few hours before Deutsche faces investors at its annual general meeting on Thursday.More details and reaction to follow....A weak reading, though, might weaken the pound and spark fresh concerns about the UK economy and consumer confidence.The Bank of England will be hosting Markets Forum 2018 - a conference to discuss measures to stamp out misconduct and make the financial world fairer and more effective."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66702a046265d78baf9bac2644b4710628d1866c/0_0_2503_1501/master/2503.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d85a5966a3f3d8dcf842cc59d00d7e6f","title":"ditch the dark circles for good tried and tested secrets of a beauty editor","story":"From a universal apricot-coloured corrector to the art of hydration, Lindsey Kelk, writer and co-host of beauty podcast Full Coverage, offers her top tips for concealing shadows beneath the eyesMy grandmother always used to tell me my dark circles were caused by me “burning the candle at both ends” – and in some instances she was probably right.

I’m from a traditional Bangladeshi Muslim background and back then my life in east London was very different. We didn’t have social media, or even mobile phones – just going to a friend’s house was difficult because my parents were very protective. I didn’t wear much make-up and rather than flick through magazines and read about beauty like other girls my age, I would devour anything I could find about Muhammad Ali and Bruce Lee.But at 18, my life changed. I went to a Muay Thai class (a form of kickboxing that’s generally regarded as the world’s toughest martial art) and found something I’d never experienced before.When I’m training and competing, I don’t care about the way I look. I feel confident in just being me. I’ll wear a really hydrating moisturiser so that my skin feels good but that’s all. Away from the ring, it’s a different story. I love fashion and makeup. Thanks to my career – I became the British and world champion for Muay Thai boxing for my weight category in 2016 – I go to a lot of awards ceremonies, and for those, I like to wear heels and a beautiful dress. I’ll go with foundation, concealer, lipstick, blusher and maybe a highlighter if I’m in the mood. I have an extensive makeup collection – I like to look elegant and pretty when I’m away from the gym but I still want to look like me. No fake eyelashes!As a society, we’re keen to put people into boxes – either you’re sporty or glamorous, you can’t be both … but that’s not true. I can be taken seriously as an athlete and look glamorous when I’m outside the ring. I firmly believe that when it comes to how you look and who you are, you should never try to please other people – if you’re pleased with yourself, then it will radiate through.When I started doing this, I was simply following a passion. Later on, I realised that I had become a role model and I didn’t know how to embrace that. But eventually, I said to myself, you’ve got an amazing platform to really inspire the next generation: to inspire girls, Muslim women, people with ME and chronic fatigue (I’ve suffered for years), people from ethnic minorities, people from low-income backgrounds – these are all obstacles I’ve faced in my own journey. But I’ve succeeded and because of that I feel confident and, yes, beautiful too. Being beautiful is simply about being bold and embracing who you are – that, combined with learning your craft and working hard, is what makes people respect you.At the moment, so many girls are reluctant to pursue sport and I think that’s often because they see it as somehow unfeminine. That’s something I’m determined to change. I train girls and some of them comment on my Instagram feed, and say it’s amazing that I don’t use filters to make myself look better in photos. I try to explain that I don’t need to do that because I’m confident in how I look – whether that’s sweating and makeup-free in the ring, or all dressed up, in mascara and lipstick. Either way, I’m comfortable as I am and that’s what I want them to feel, too. I want them to discover what their bodies are capable of – everyone has strengths and it’s about discovering yours and pursuing that.This year, I’ve switched from Muay Thai to boxing. It’s a completely different discipline. While I’ve got the strength and the fighter’s mentality from kickboxing, the timing, the balance, the guard and the footwork are all different. I’m in training twice a day, six days a week, and living on a very strict diet while I build my foundations in this new sport. I know the road might not be straight but I’m not going to give up. A fighter’s mentality is about having resilience. When I’m in the ring, my coach and my manager won’t be able to help me. I’ve got to rely on myself and know how to be my own best friend.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa ParryStyling: Steph Stevens make up: Jose Bass hair: Jamie McCormick"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ff16fb470a460865750db88339a3d4111f772d3/0_0_1588_953/master/1588.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99bc891241dd4e36cffba4c75a64b610","title":"your best ever skin five beauty mantras to follow religiously","story":"From dewy-skin secrets and sunscreen misting to foundation on ice – listen to your mamas and makeup artists when it comes to the best beauty tipsFrom dewy-skin secrets and sunscreen misting to foundation on ice – listen to your mamas and makeup artists when it comes to the best beauty tipsAs a beauty editor who has been writing about the subject for many years, I am so often touted as an expert. The reality, however, is that much of the beauty knowledge and knowhow I put into practice on a regular basis has been inspired by some of the amazing women in my life – from my mother to my favourite makeup artist – who have shared their tips and tricks with me. And now I am sharing them with you.Mind your décolletageLong before neck creams became a thing, my mother always highlighted the importance of treating your décolletage (that space between your chin and your chest) as you would the skin on your face. Although I was barely into my teens, she made a (daily) point of making sure I had meticulously washed and moisturised my neck and chest. She was adamant that if I didn’t do this, the texture and hue beyond my chin would start to look significantly different to the one on my face. It was exhausting having this relentless mantra sounding in your ear. As a young girl, taking care of the skin on my neck was the least of my priorities. Decades later, however, my mother’s advice has paid off she spoke the truth. It is a beauty step I follow to this day, and I now tell everyone who cares to listen, because it is never too late to start.So far, so perfect. But what happens when, one day, you look in the mirror and for some strange reason your perfect foundation doesn’t look quite as perfect as it did before? “Don’t blame it on the foundation,” says my long-time makeup artist friend. She believes a myriad of reasons could affect the finish – your hormones, change in season (every girl needs more than one shade to accommodate this), lack of sleep … “It’s all about how you store it,” she says. Most people keep their foundation in the (humid, steamy) bathroom, or in their bedroom, where it is exposed to the sun and direct light. All of this oxidises your foundation, which affects the colour, texture and its appearance when on your skin. The trick to keeping your perfect foundation perfect, she reveals, is to keep it in the fridge. Trust me, it works.Apply concealer after foundationMy younger sister is a huge beauty fan, but she doesn’t work in the beauty industry and by no means would she ever even call herself an expert. And yet I learn some of the most wonderful tricks and tips from her. She is the one who first introduced me to the joys of concealers. From her I learned that applying your foundation first and your concealer second is a much better way to ensure you don’t overdo it and end up with a cakey finish halfway through the day. I love a concealer that feels lightweight but provides full flawless coverage, such as the Clinique Beyond Perfecting Super Concealer, but when I apply my foundation first, I find I don’t need to use half as much – everything blends much more seamlessly and it stays that way all day.Supercharge your beauty routine with hyaluronic acidOne of the benefits of my job is that I get to meet women who are doing incredible things in the beauty industry. One of my favourites is a prolific dermatologist who works with some of Hollywood’s most famous faces. She was one of the first skincare experts I heard extolling the benefits of hyaluronic acid, which holds 1,000 times its weight in moisture. It has become my skincare mainstay. My dermatologist encouraged me to blend it into my foundation and powder highlighter before applying – this gives you the dewiest skin ever. She also advised mixing it into powdery or glittery eyeshadows – it is kinder to the eyes, goes on the lids without dragging and the end result is a much more silky, modern-looking finish, with major skincare benefits.Top up your SPF with clever mists Facials are quite possibly my favourite beauty treatment. I tend to battle uneven skin tone, so a good facial complements my skincare regime, which is infused with brighteners, acid exfoliators, vitamin C and a good SPF. Without sun protection, UV rays exacerbate my hyperpigmentation issues. And so I have long been religious about using a high SPF every day. What I didn’t know, however, was that I was doing it all wrong. My facialist taught me that my SPF is only effective when it is constantly topped up (ideally every two hours). This, of course, poses a dilemma: how on earth do you keep applying SPF throughout your working day, while you still have your makeup on? She introduced me to the idea of sunscreen mists and makeup-setting sprays that have SPF in them (some pressed powders also have SPF in, and can be brushed on during the day). Not only are these mists brilliant for dealing with the heat and refreshing your face and providing protection, but you can also spray them right through the day without it ruining your makeup. Genius."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06387545e1cb04a57399d669abf9d713bcc1acb2/0_376_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4ab55d4dd27f4386b7a93450b01e65","title":"deliveroo couriers dystopia union","story":"A Black Mirror existence: that’s how trade unionist Mags Dewhurst describes working as a rider for Deliveroo, the pre-eminent online food-delivery company. Here is a story of workers branded as entrepreneurs, which has the effect of stripping away their rights of a race to the bottom in terms and conditions of being managed by algorithms and apps. I sit with five Deliveroo couriers in the headquarters of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), a union that has successfully fought for particularly low-paid migrant workers. They are currently classed as self-employed independent contractors, or cycling micro-businesses, and therefore lack rights all workers should be able to take for granted: the minimum wage, paid holidays, pensions, protection from discrimination, and trade union rights.At the end of 2016 the union applied to win collective bargaining rights for Deliveroo riders in Camden and Kentish Town, north London, which would mean making them a category of self-employment known as “limb (b) workers”, granting them these basic rights. Three weeks before the case was heard by the central arbitration committee, Deliveroo pulled a clever stunt. The company inserted a new substitution clause in the contracts of all the workers, supposedly granting riders the “right” to allow anyone else to do their job in their place. This was farcical. A rider would have to conduct a criminal record check and an immigration check, as well as complying with other legislation – for example, to determine they had not been trafficked – on any potential substitute. This allowed Deliveroo to present riders as self-employed contractors: because after all, which worker is allowed to find a substitute to do their job for them?We would like to find out how consumers opinions and habits might be changing in light of stories about companies employing gig economy workers.You can share your views here via our encrypted form. They will help our journalists have a more complete picture and we will use some of them in our reporting.Deliveroo says it seeks to give workers fair terms and conditions. All the same, consider the accounts of its riders. Their present could be your future.It once was the case that they’d get training, says 24-year-old Tom, a rider from Tooting: “You’d go out on a bike with a recruitment assessor – called a trainer – who was also classified as an independent contractor.” There’s a lack of suitable training partly, the riders tell me, because that would make them look like workers, not contractors. “It’s cut-your-nose-off-to-spite-your-face lengths to twist their business model,” says Tom. “Can you imagine if they’d told investors with their original business model: ‘We’ll pick random people off the street’? Of course they didn’t!”Most Deliveroo riders are paid per drop, pay for their own equipment and service their own bikes. If it’s a quiet time of day, that can mean clocking into work on your app, waiting around and being paid nothing. Each worker is assigned a zone – a city such as London is ided into dozens of them – to make deliveries. But the riders tell me the zones are being constantly expanded in size, meaning it takes longer to make deliveries meaning less money.“Everything is algorithmically managed,” says 20-year-old Guy from Brighton. “But the app is quite glitchy: you can lose your signal, your job gets unassigned, and if you get too many unassigned deliveries, you lose your job.” Such a system encourages riders to travel at dangerous speeds: once, 25-year-old Mohann came off his motorbike and badly injured his knee cap, but continued to his destination for fear that terminating the job would get him the sack.Those who do the most drops get first dibs to choose the most lucrative time slots to work, which is nowhere near as fair as it sounds. “You sell it to the riders in this really macho way, that if you’re really speedy and committed to the company you’ll make loads of money,” says Dewhurst. “But the reality is there are so many variables out of your control: restaurants taking too long, customers not being in, bike punctures.”If you find yourself in a shift working for less than the minimum wage and log out, that’s a black mark, leaving you forced to get a less lucrative shift next time around.Riders speak of colleagues who have been sacked for arbitrary reasons out of their control, including glitches in the system and mistakes made in the call centre.As 31-year-old Barnet courier Alan puts it: “If you transfer responsibility to those without the means for responsibility, you return to Victorian piecework with no workers’ rights.”Deliveroo presents its model as an opportunity to get an occasional bit of money on the side – pocket money even. That its riders value the flexibility. But in practice no business can work and thrive like that. The riders emphasise they’re not against flexibility, innovation or technology: they just want rights. It doesn’t take very much imagination to see how employment dystopia beckons.As Jason Moyer-Lee, the union’s general secretary, puts it to me: unlike, say, immigration law, there is weak enforcement of employment law. You can see how the model could be expanded, to coffee chains, or clothing stores. “You could log into a Topshop app, and then join a queue to work,” Dewhurst says. It is an attractive proposition for companies, stripping out labour costs and HR. Consider that zero-hours contracts were an obscure innovation until they were rolled out across the economy. It could indeed be a Black Mirror episode. It isn’t: it is Britain in 2018. Black Mirror in real time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85df33e09a8947ca4e407de56f57e208ccea8cc1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74451ed21908061ec75c8d6086712bd4","title":"miss britain brexitland brexit horror ex mayor ipswich netherlands","story":"When I moved back to the Netherlands this summer after six lovely years in Britain, I knew I was going to miss the place and that every now and then I would wonder if I had made the right decision. Everybody who voluntarily moves countries goes through this, and knows that these doubts can keep you awake all night.Except that this time it is really, really easy for us to be at peace with our decision to leave the United Kingdom. We simply go online and read a story like the one that broke yesterday: “Ex-mayor of Ipswich denied citizenship after almost 40 years in UK”. The reason: the Home Office “cannot be satisfied” that Inga Lockington, who moved from Denmark in 1979, is a permanent resident.No doubt the wave of publicity in this case will force the government into a U-turn. This government has made so many already it is a miracle that Theresa May isn’t permanently dizzy. But the underlying dynamic will not change, as the recent Windrush affair demonstrated all too well: this government is either incapable of, or unwilling to, treat citizens’ rights with respect, especially those who have their origins abroad.But worst of all, we could not be sure that we would even have qualified for that British passport – meaning total insecurity about the university fees for our children, and about their status when applying for jobs later in life. The same holds for our rights to social security and access to the NHS – if the NHS survives Brexit, that is.Such insecurity might last for years, if not decades, considering that almost two years after the referendum result the British government still does not even have a position on what it would like the country’s relationship with the EU to be. Given the Tories’ woeful ineptitude, deluded thinking and many deceitful statements, it is also becoming increasingly hard to see how the EU could take any British position on good faith. How to reach an agreement when you cannot trust the other side to uphold it? For EU citizens in Britain there is no certainty about when the insecurity about their status might be settled.Still, there are moments when I think that it was a mistake to move. London was such a great place to live, and our state school offered such excellent education. But then I remember just how many EU nationals have already left Britain, and how many are in advanced stages of leaving. The same is true of a number of British friends, who are fanning out across continental Europe.To kill any remaining longings for a return to the UK I then go online once more to browse the billionaire-owned Brexit press. This is my way of reminding myself just how psychopathically vile and mendacious most of the UK press still is. Once Britain begins to pay the full economic, political and diplomatic price for what it recklessly voted for in June 2016, the Brexit media will not throw up their hands and beg for forgiveness for all their lies, falsehoods and empty promises. Instead they will blame lots of British iniduals and institutions, but most of all they will direct their anger and hostility towards one place in particular: the EU.Do I want to expose my children to the tabloid propaganda about EU aggression towards poor Brexit Britain, and the way it will be pumped into the heads of millions of Brits – including some in the school playground?I still miss Britain every day. But I also know that this country I miss no longer exists.• Joris Luyendijk, author of Swimming with Sharks: My Journey Into the World of the Bankers, wrote the ’s banking blog"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf5dc38fa82d31bed8658888036ac43e89f2c96c/0_160_5360_3217/master/5360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb06247ce49e5eaf6e9ad1444ccbdddd","title":"ofsted not inspected hundreds schools decade report","story":"Long delay between checks raises concerns that standards may have slipped at many ‘outstanding’ schoolsDoubts have been cast on the quality of some of the country’s most sought-after schools after it emerged that hundreds graded outstanding by Ofsted have not been inspected for more than a decade and their assessments may be out of date.A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed that more than 1,600 schools teaching tens of thousands of pupils had not been inspected for six years or more, and of those, almost 300 had not seen an Ofsted inspector for at least 10 years.The schools watchdog is legally required to re-inspect schools every five years, but those judged outstanding – many of which are grammar schools – are exempt from reinspection. Concerns have thus been raised about the continuing accuracy of the judgments on which many parents base their choice of school. It is the first time the NAO has investigated the schools inspectorate, and its report is highly critical in places, concluding that Ofsted cannot demonstrate that its inspection of schools represents value for money, and does not know whether its inspections are having the intended impact of raising education standards.According to the report, over the last four years, Ofsted failed to meet its statutory target to reinspect schools within five years in 43 cases. In each case Ofsted has offered an explanation. It also failed to meet its own target of reinspecting inadequate schools in 78 cases over the same period.The report, published on Thursday, shows time spent on inspections diminishing and periods between inspections extending. According to Ofsted’s own targets, good schools should be reinspected every three years, but in 201617 this period increased to four years. The maximum time for reinspection of schools graded as “requires improvement” – and therefore in need of closer attention – was extended from two years to 30 months, but 55 schools still waited longer. Ofsted also missed its target of inspecting new schools within two years of opening in 95 cases between 201214 and 20145, and extended the target to three years. As a result, the watchdog has switched from conducting in-depth, comprehensive inspections to a “snapshot” of standards, using a light-touch, risk-focused model of inspection. A good primary school, for example, will be inspected by a single inspector over a day. Resources are concentrated on underperforming schools, leaving high-achieving schools unchecked by routine inspection, as long as data shows that they are maintaining performance.“The length of time without inspection means that some pupils go through primary andor secondary without an independent assessment of their school’s effectiveness,” the report states. “The older an inspection judgment, the greater the risk that it is no longer accurate. This reduces the level of assurance available about the school concerned.”Responding to the report, Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said the organisation was operating in a difficult financial environment. “This means that we have had to make tough decisions about how we prioritise resources. I am confident that Ofsted gets the balance right. For example, by focusing more resource on inspection of schools that are less than good. An increase in either the number of inspections or time spent on inspection will quite simply require greater funding.“Ofsted is only one lever in the school system, which is why it has proven difficult for the NAO to judge our impact and value for money. As we have made clear to the NAO, judging ourselves against school outcomes would inevitably create perverse incentives.”Launching the report, the NAO head Amyas Morse acknowledged Ofsted’s strengths: “Ofsted’s role as an independent inspector is valued by parents, headteachers think its judgements are fair, and it is making headway against recent performance shortfalls.Teachers’ leaders who have long criticised Ofsted welcomed the report as confirmation of their view that Ofsted was not fit for purpose and called on ministers to conduct a root and branch review of the system of holding schools to account.Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The revelation that Ofsted does not know whether its school inspections are having the intended impact, to raise the standards of education and improve the quality of children and young peoples’ lives, is devastating.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We agree with the head of the NAO that cheaper inspection is not necessarily better inspection, and we support the recommendation for a review into whether Ofsted has the resources to do its job.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f04096f4fd152a29fff062fdc32efc41390d3778/12_0_4996_2998/master/4996.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=341626188979173edb6b92836e5a831b","title":"back from the brink chequered skipper butterfly takes to english skies again","story":"Dozens of fast-flying butterflies released in a secret location in Northamptonshire forest after disappearing in 1976It mysteriously vanished from England after the long hot summer of 1976, but the chequered skipper butterfly is taking to the skies again as part of a bid to revive 20 endangered species.Several dozen mostly female butterflies have been collected in Belgium and released in a secret location in Rockingham forest, Northamptonshire.What sounds like a simple operation has taken months of meticulous preparation by Butterfly Conservation scientists, who have surveyed suitable habitat, advised on how forest rides are mown, and identified the ideal region of Europe that best matches the climate and vegetation in Northamptonshire.“It is a privilege to help return this charismatic little butterfly to its former stronghold of Rockingham forest,” said Dr Nigel Bourn, Butterfly Conservation’s director of science. “It has taken many years and a lot of hard work from many people to get to this point and I am very proud to be part of the team collecting these beautiful butterflies and returning them to England at last.”Four Butterfly Conservation scientists were joined by the Belgian conservation authorities and volunteers, using nets to catch these fast-flying butterflies. The catchers were soaked by thunderstorms and chased by wild boar but collected 42 of the butterflies, 31 female and 11 male, transporting them in inidual containers inside a cool-bag in a van via the Channel Tunnel.More females were caught than males because these are already mated, and carrying eggs they will hopefully lay on their principal food plant, false-brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), which is now widespread in the woods of Rockingham forest.While there is a growing number of successful reintroduction schemes with birds such as red kites and white-tailed eagles, it has proved more complicated to put back smaller insects. This is only the second official reintroduction scheme for an extinct butterfly in England, following the success of the large blue, which was revived via caterpillars brought from Sweden after becoming extinct in 1979.The chequered skipper reintroduction is part of the £4.6m Heritage Lottery Fund Back from the Brink project, which aims to save 20 species from extinction and benefit 200 more in 19 locations around England. In Rockingham, forest rides (access tracks or paths) are being widened to enable wild flowers to flourish and woodlands are being restored to benefit other species including adders, willow tits, lesser-spotted woodpeckers and barbastelle bats.In Rockingham, a select group of volunteers will help follow the newly released butterflies to see which flowers they nectar upon and where they lay their eggs. Andy Wyldes last saw the butterfly more than 40 years ago in Northamptonshire, when he was 11 years old. “It’s fantastic, it’s exciting and it means not having to travel all the way to Scotland to see it,” he said.Wyldes and other volunteers must guard this secret location because scientists are worried that trampling of grass by enthusiastic butterfly-spotters could endanger the caterpillars, which feed high on the grass stems.It took butterfly scientists more than a decade to bring back the large blue. While Bourn said he was confident this four-year reintroduction programme would be a success, he said it was important they put more iniduals into a second site next year in case the secret site is discovered.The chequered skipper was once found in woodlands from Oxfordshire to Lincolnshire but its sudden disappearance in the 1970s took conservationists by surprise. Changing forest management with a decline in coppicing and the planting of conifer plantations made woodlands too shady for the butterfly, and it is thought that the drought during the summer of 1976 was the final death knell.The butterfly continues to thrive in the highlands of Scotland and scientists believe it can only survive in moist woodlands where the grasses on which the caterpillars feed stay green and grow for most of the year. But the chequered skipper feeds on a plant in Scotland which is not found in England and so scientists brought specimens from an area of Belgium where the food plants and, crucially, rainfall, matches that of Northamptonshire. The British scientists were helped by experts from Belgium’s government and the Research Institute for Nature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79a09801ddfb29bd370dc78fc9633b12d9d12bab/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee7f67e89fbfa27fcfa87d025ed00e78","title":"air pollution worse inside london classrooms than outside study finds","story":"Exclusive: study of schools in capital finds dangerous levels of fine particulate pollution within classrooms, putting children at risk Children in London schools are being exposed to higher levels of damaging air pollution inside the classroom than outside, putting them at risk of lifelong health problems, a new study has revealed.Scientists studied five primary schools and one nursery in the capital as part of research into levels of air pollution indoors. The research shows that outdoor air pollution from diesel vehicles and other sources – both of nitrogen dioxide and particulate pollution – is affecting the lives of children inside schools.Young children – who are more vulnerable to airborne pollutants than adults – are breathing in fine particle pollution (PM10 and the even smaller PM2.5) at levels which are higher than the annual World Health Organisation  guidelines of 10μgm3 and 20μgm3 respectively, the report said. Particulate pollution is primarily a product of diesel vehicles, tyre and brake dust, and solid fuel-burning, but can also come from inside a building itself.In the case of PM10, children are being exposed to higher levels inside their lessons than outside on the street or in the playground, the report found.The study, which was commissioned by the mayor of London and carried out by the Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering at University College London and the University of Cambridge chemistry department, examined five primaries and one nursery.The report said a significant level of air pollution indoors in urban areas was due to outdoor pollution penetrating the buildings.“Children living or attending schools nearer high-traffic density roads were exposed to higher levels of motor vehicle exhaust gases and had higher incidence and prevalence of childhood asthma and wheeze,” it said. “A higher incidence of childhood asthma was positively associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Exposure to particulate matter was also associated with a higher incidence of wheeze in children.”The study does not call for classrooms to be sealed off from outside air pollution as the issue is complex, and some studies indicate cognitive performance of children in classrooms is improved at lower temperatures with more ventilation.The schools studied were a modern suburban nursery and primary school away from high traffic streets, a Victorian-built primary next to a busy road, two similar schools away from high traffic areas and a suburban modern school building close to a major road.The findings came as the mayor published his first audit of air pollution at 50 of the capital’s schools and a series of measures to help them counter the impact of poor air quality around their schools.The mayor on Thursday announced the creation of a £1m fund to help the worst-affected schools bring in changes immediately. The money will also provide 20 nurseries with air quality audits and indoor air filters.A spokesperson for the mayor said: “This report shows that indoor air pollution is a serious problem in our city’s schools, but the problem will not be resolved by simply opening or closing windows and doors. Instead, we need to reduce sources of air pollution in and near schools.”The research highlights just how at-risk children are to the impacts of dirty air. “Children spend a great deal of time inside school buildings,” the report said. “They are more vulnerable to airborne pollutants than adults not only because of their narrower airways, but also because they generally breathe more air per kilogram of body weight. “The exposure of children’s developing lungs to air pollution can result in reduced lung function that persists through to adulthood, increasing susceptibility to respiratory and cardiovascular disease.”Recent research suggests that even low levels of PM2.5 pollution can cause heart problems, and experts have said it is an urgent public health priority and suggestedtargeting the worst offenders, such as diesel vehicles, with policy measures.The new research was published in the week the environment secretary, Michael Gove, was criticised for not taking tougher measures against diesel vehicles in his air quality plan. The government’s failure to act on air pollution from diesel vehicles was this week referred to Europe’s highest court.

But new research shows that 25 of the committee’s 45 members are either farmers, former farmers, CAP payment recipients in another capacity, current or former partners in agricultural businesses, or have spouses who own farms. Another four have looser ties to the sector, such as having close family who are farmers. The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said that lawmakers with conflicts of interest should stand down in future votes. She told the : “Every committee needs expertise and experience. That’s very important to parliament’s work. But in doing that work, MEPs must follow the parliament’s code of conduct which states that they carry out their duties with disinterest, integrity, openness and diligence. Any office holder that has a vested interest in a certain policy should excuse themselves by declining to vote or abstaining.”British MEPs on the committee with declarations listing agribusiness links include: Richard Ashworth (Independent Conservative) who earns €1,000-€5,000 per month for his farm and between €5,000-€10,000 per month for his chairmanship of United Milk PLC and former chair of NFU Corporate John Stuart Agnew (Ukip), who receives between €1,000-€5,000 a month for his Norfolk farm, and Jim Nicholson (Ulster Unionist party), the part-owner of a farm in Armagh.John Capone, a spokesman for Richard Ashworth, told the  that he “hasn’t earned a penny from the farming business for near on 20 years so the declaration needs to be updated.” However, in his most recent declaration of interests, filed last summer, his farming and industry incomes were stated to be between €6,000-€16,000 per month.Ashworth resigned the Tory whip over Brexit and now sits with the European People’s party group in parliament. Capone said that as an MEP from a departing country, he refuses to vote on future agricultural issues for ethical reasons.A spokesman for Agnew said: “Before he was elected, he made very clear that as a farmer he was very interested in defending British farmers’ interests. As long as one declares one’s interests, then having some expertise is probably a good thing, isn’t it?” However, some EU figures are concerned that the outcome of the EU’s CAP review could be steered by lawmakers with an interest in maintaining the status quo.Under the presidency of José Manuel Barroso earlier this decade, the committee’s MEPs are said to have blocked a commission proposal to put a maximum cap on farm subsidies.One senior source who has negotiated past “trilogues” – three-way legislative mediation between the EU’s parliament, commission and 28 member states – described the committee as “a powerful lobby for farmers”.He said: “It definitely looks to be a problem that the people who decide on the attribution of finances benefit from them directly and have such an important voice in the decision making process.” One recent investigation found that a majority of farms surveyed in seven EU countries received €104m of CAP direct payments in 2017, despite being their nations’ highest emitters of ammonia. Greenpeace, which collated the new MEPs’ data from publicly available sources, said that farmers’ input was vital for reforming EU policy, but that an imbalanced committee risked public health. Marco Contiero, Greenpeace EU’s agriculture policy director, told the : “With an absolute majority, the interests of the farming industry can be imposed on all the other sectors of society. That’s why it is essential that the CAP reform is decided by a wider set of decision-makers, including those coming from the health, climate and environmental sectors.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc552774223a7e2c89d97935d4602df6d86b8daf/0_0_2338_1402/master/2338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00cf3b435d159c66b1086284fd6a92d","title":"great british bee count 2018 in pictures","story":"As the fifth annual Great British Bee Count gets under way, wildlife and gardening experts are calling on the public to grow weeds to help Britain’s bees.

But I was persuaded by my political advisers it would be harmful, and that was another mistake that I made.”Peter Kunhardt, an Emmy-winning director, was inside the house at that precise moment sitting with McCain’s wife Cindy and daughter Meghan, who were watching the taping as it was being relayed live on a TV monitor. “They actually gasped when he said he wished he had picked Lieberman,” Kunhardt said. “After the filming, Cindy came up to us and said that was the first time he’d ever said that.”It’s not so much that McCain had finally admitted regret over his decision to forgo choosing Lieberman to be his running mate in the 2008 presidential election. It was, after all, an unlikely pairing – McCain was the Republican nominee and Lieberman was at that time a Democrat.It was what flowed from that fateful decision that made the comment so riveting: the rise of Sarah Palin. To choose the gun-totin’ mama grizzly from Alaska as his alternative vice-presidential pick arguably did more than anything to let the populist genie out of the bottle, unleashing the terrifying consequences that we are still wrestling with today.The on-camera confession is the most electrifying part of John McCain: For Whom the Bell Tolls, the upcoming HBO documentary that Kunhardt has directed with his sons George and Teddy. The family trio spent six hours interviewing the US senator from Arizona – three in Sedona, three on Capitol Hill – and with the footage have put together a retrospective of his life on the verge of death.It makes for a strange cinematic animal. The Kunhardts stressed that they consciously set out to locate the film in the present tense – “We wanted to capture the living John McCain, not the dead John McCain,” as Teddy put it. But McCain’s diagnosis last July of a deadly brain tumor inevitably hangs heavy in the Sedona air, giving the documentary the feel of an obituary produced and broadcast while the subject is still with us.That slightly awkward sense of an eulogy to a living man comes across most strongly from McCain himself. Early on in the film the 81-year-old makes a grand gesture direct to camera, saying: “I have lived an honorable life, and I am proud of my life.” He sounds eerily as though he were dictating his own epitaph.The idea for a film came about with lightning speed after McCain’s diagnosis with glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain tumor, was made public. Teddy Kunhardt proposed it on the same day as the announcement, and they took it days later to HBO, who immediately gave it a green light.Days after that they pitched it to McCain himself and he went for it immediately. “John is cognizant this is a terrible disease and he wanted to get his story down as much as we wanted to tell it. When we approached him there was an immediate, ‘Yes, let’s do it and let’s do it now’,” said Teddy.The father-sons team are unapologetic about the favorable light in which they cast their subject – literally so: they filmed him under Sedona’s famously soft natural desert light. Though they gave McCain no editorial control over the documentary, they openly hail him as an “American hero” and buy uncritically into the mythology of the “maverick” politician that McCain has studiously cultivated over many years.Certainly, the case for John McCain as hero and maverick can be made, and the Kunhardts do so over almost two hours of entertaining viewing. No matter what Donald Trump may say about it, McCain’s fortitude over five years of torture and prolonged solitary confinement in the “Hanoi Hilton” as a prisoner of war in Vietnam had heroic qualities.At several junctures in his political career he resisted peer pressure within the Republican party and went his own “maverick” way. Even this month, while sick at home in Arizona, he opposed the confirmation of Gina Haspel as director of the CIA given her refusal to disown torture, prompting the Trump White House to stoop to new lows when an aide said his view could be discounted as he was “dying anyway”. The senator’s political friendships too reflect a willingness to cross the aisle that these days seem almost quaintly from another age. The supporting cast on the HBO documentary makes the point – Joe Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, Barack Obama: his Democratic admirers outnumber the Republican. “When we made the initial list for the film we were surprised by how many Democrats there were,” Teddy Kunhardt said. “It hit home his point of bipartisanship: Republicans or Democrats, they are not your enemies.”At times McCain should be credited with both acting heroically and as a maverick. Take 25 July last year, just days after his diagnosis, when he ignored doctors’ warnings and flew back from Arizona to the US Senate, the blood barely dried in an open gash from surgery above his left eye, to cast his vote on a Republican plan to scrap Obamacare.The documentary lingers over that exceptional moment to powerful effect. It follows McCain as he received a standing ovation entering the Senate chamber. Then it pans in as, later that night, he stood in front of his stony-faced colleagues, held out his right arm for what seems an aeon, then let his thumb drop to confine the Republican bill to the dustbin of history.There were audible gasps on that occasion too.But the problem with this kind of glowing eulogy – whether composed before his death or after – is that it obscures, amid the adulation, deeper and in some regards darker aspects of the inidual and the life. McCain’s conception of heroism is in itself inextricably linked with his embrace of militarism. He uses the language of “sacrifice” and serving a “greater cause” – a worldview handed down to him by his naval father and grandfather. Describing his captivity in Vietnam, McCain explains his stoicism to the Kunhardts thus: “McCains were doing what McCains were bred to do, and if it brings you into harm’s way, that was our profession.”“He is the representative of one type of heroic American character,” said Peter Kunhardt, whose film-making career has specialised to some extent in profiling major American politicians including Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy. “John McCain is distinctive in that he takes this code of conduct from his training in the military and he overlays it with his own personal view of how to serve as an American.”But there are consequences. In foreign policy terms his default position is that of uber-hawk. After his release from Vietnamese captivity in 1973, he was one of a dwindling band of those who backed Richard Nixon in stepping up bombing of Vietnam and Cambodia.He continued the theme with firm support for George Bush’s reckless invasion of Iraq, going on to remark in 2008 that if US troops stayed inside the country for 100 years that would be “fine by me”. More recently he has struck similarly bellicose postures on Syria and North Korea.In his politics at home he has also displayed critical weakness when he most needed to tap that legendary heroism. In his first presidential run in 2000, he blatantly pandered to racism to save his own electoral prospects – he told voters in South Carolina that he regarded the Confederate battle flag then flying from the state capitol as an acceptable “symbol of heritage”. (He later reversed his position, but by then the damage had arguably been done.)A similar pattern of political expediency emerged in his second and final run on the White House against Barack Obama in 2008. In that race he shed his maverick skin and conducted himself as a conventional grubby candidate prepared to do whatever it took to get elected – on tax cuts, immigration reform, abortion and other key issues he abandoned earlier principled stances to take the populist route.The Kunhardts said that they addressed key moments in which McCain failed to meet his own moral standards as a theme in the film. “We wanted to show his past failures and how he hit them head on and learned from them and moved forward – the idea that you can recognize what you’ve done wrong and try and do right,” Teddy said.Which brings us neatly back to Sarah Palin and that controversial VP pick.On 29 August 2008 McCain stood in front of a large crowd in Dayton, Ohio, and introduced “the next vice-president of the United States, Governor Sarah Palin of the great state of Alaska”. The HBO documentary lingers over this moment as well, zooming in on the man in what must have been a singularly lonely instance.The scene is terrible to behold. There he stands, his face locked in an unconvincing smile, like a child desperately feigning delight as he opens an unwanted birthday present.“I don’t think he could have known it at the time,” the New York Times columnist David Brooks tells the Kunhardts. “But he took a disease that was running through the Republican party – anti-intellectualism, disrespect for facts – and he put it right at the center of the party.”That’s an important caveat as we assess John McCain on the point of his own mortality. He can plausibly claim to represent the antithesis of the current incumbent of the White House: he is as open-minded as Trump is partisan, as public-spirited as Trump is self-serving, he speaks honor to Trump’s pussy grabbing.But he also has to face tough questions that the Kunhardts pointedly skirt around. Did he do enough when he effectively led the Republican party to hold back the dark forces welling up within it? Must he accept a share of blame for the ugly, ominous world he will probably soon leave behind?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c5a46e6ea6dc1cea59c388e1ea0288b6da424c8/566_0_2553_1533/master/2553.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cb2ed8c8640443bc11f1e0a1cd40c07","title":"the breadwinner review clarity and charm in twist of fate animation","story":"How do you keep your family going in Kabul when the only male provider has been imprisoned?

Zama must also participate – jadedly, diffidently – in the official duties of state violence and racism: enforcing the enslavement of the indigenous peoples. As an americano, that is someone born in the Americas and not Spain, Zama suspects that he himself is regarded as a second-rater in the colonial service. Is this why he has been forgotten, left behind in this burning swamp? He doesn’t know, and has no way of finding out.It’s a waking nightmare that is part existential paralysis, part erotic reverie. Martel has adapted the 1956 novel by the Argentinian author Antonio di Benedetto, who has been rediscovered in the English-speaking world since Esther Allen published her translation for the NYRB Classics edition in 2000, with a fascinating introduction wondering whether the book’s languorous evocation of official cruelty foreshadowed Di Benedetto’s own imprisonment and torture at the hands of the Argentinian junta 20 years later, in the 70s.Zama is a story that obviously has something of Beckett and Kafka, but creates worryingly plausible real-world evocations of their cosmic loneliness and bureaucratic imprisonment. And its increasingly important and toxic plot development is Borgesian. The colonial officers, worried about their patent inability to keep the peace, are terrified by rumours of a certain all-powerful and legendary bandit Vicuña Porto. Eventually, out of pure frustrated rage, Zama will join an ad hoc military expedition pledged to capture and kill this spectral figure – only to suspect that he is closer to hand than anyone had imagined. Is Vicuña simply the ghost of their own colonial exhaustion and disgust?Martel creates deeply strange tableaux of longing and alienation. Zama furtively lurks behind a rock, peeping at naked village women taking a mud bath. When one cries “Voyeur!” and chases him, he slaps her – a gesture of arrogance and spite made more pathetic by the unavailability of that married patrician beauty he is hopelessly courting: Luciana Piñares De Luenga, terrifically played by Almodóvar regular Lola Dueñas. The difference between their dreary parochial setting and the fanatically imagined refinement of Spain is ever-present. In one of these spartan salons, Luciana murmurs: “Europe is best remembered by those who were never there.”The movie forcefully creates the colonial administrator’s stunned disgust and suppressed dismay: Martel’s Zama is not so far from Herzog’s Don Lupe De Aguirre – or closer maybe to Coppola’s Capt Willard, journeying deep into the jungle on the orders of an imperial power. But Martel’s movie finds a emphasis different from Di Benedetto’s book. Her focus is not just on Zama’s gradual and pitiable breakdown, but on the violence that is crushing everyone. There is a different kind of orientalism at work here – an occidentalism, perhaps, an imperialism that has exoticised the peoples of the Americas to the west. Their bodies are fetishised: either bound up and chained, prior to beating and torture, or naked and exposed, in a way that discloses Zama’s horror of transgression, of giving way to his desires that may bind him here for ever. Zama is left with his tragicomic white man’s burden. A heatstruck world of desire and defeat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf2ebbc9828567445279bce07293e962ada6b70/196_950_2148_1289/master/2148.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ef9f83596cdca71377458e905b9b8b8","title":"hdy","story":"Fittingly Unai Emery’s overture as Arsenal’s head coach was high tempo and demanding. A whirlwind first day began on a transatlantic flight and flipped straight from the red eye into a burst of meeting, greeting and looking the part in the newly fitted club suit. For the Spaniard first impressions played a big part in his successful audition for the job and he set about making new ones as he introduced himself. The energy he likes to transmit was on show.Upstairs in the directors’ box lounge at the Emirates Stadium he tried to expand on what makes him tick. It was evident that the way he will communicate with his players is full on. From the way he spoke – making a determined effort to explain himself in English in his clear, booming voice – to the way he amplified his points with expressive gestures, his eyes darting briskly around the room to try not to miss anything, Emery will be an altogether different kind of presence around the squad. Arsène Wenger tended to be more cerebral, more observant, more about guiding someone than pushing him.Emery’s brand of charisma comes across as animated, spirited and direct.“I think the most important thing is to connect with people and have those personal relationships,” Emery said. “Heart to heart, head to head. The heart transmits emotion, the head transmits the intelligence. So it’s really important to have that connection both on a personal and collective level. What you are looking for is a shared experience. It’s true that you get the famous egos in football but that is true of top players and players who are not so good. I’m a coach that has come from second ision, gone through to the first ision, coached at PSG and now at Arsenal. And really the essence of it all is people.”Emery has begun to study the personalities he will begin to work with over the summer. Arsenal are not overly represented at the World Cup, so he will soon be trying to make those connections with a large proportion of the squad, the vehicle through which he will introduce his philosophy. While paying due respect to the “love for possession” he saw as part of the club’s heritage, he also stresses how his football ideal is also about intensity and pressing.That is another departure from Wenger’s focus on expression with the ball and it will be interesting to see how quickly Emery can effect a stylistic transformation. “I like to win the ball back as quickly as possible,” he said. “It’s about two things: possession and pressing.“Football is a demanding and difficult sport. What we want to do is not fear any team, either here in the Premier League or in Europe, and our objective is to be among the best and to beat the best. I’m the type of coach who has always worked really hard – not because I do it better than anyone else but because that is what I believe the most important thing is.” He talked about “that desire to be better” like a kind of compulsion, adding: “I’ve never seen anything handed out for free in football.”The 46-year-old looked effortlessly relaxed and confident in himself. He had that air of being comfortable in his own skin that comes with having the balance of experience and motivation to feel sure he can do this job well. When Wenger started at Arsenal (at the same age Emery is now) he described himself as “full of hope, full of belief as well” and Emery emits the same vibes.For all the revolution that began when Arsenal last appointed a new manager 22 years ago, a rarity in bringing a foreign manager into the English game, this announcement was a snapshot of how the football landscape has changed. It was an entirely international affair. In London Arsenal were introduced to a man from the Basque country who had been interviewed by a panel of football executives from South Africa, Germany and Spain, having impressed an American owner, to be shown around a stadium named after a Middle Eastern airline on the day the club unveiled record-breaking shirt sleeve sponsors from Rwanda.Emery took it all in his steady stride. He had been in contact with the Arsenal hierarchy while in charge of Paris Saint-Germain, attending the first interview two days after the French Cup final and with two Ligue 1 games remaining (nothing untoward as his departure from the Parc des Princes had been sealed and made public). The three big meetings he had with Arsenal went from strength to strength, making him the unanimous choice. His blend of personality and pedigree, and a willingness to work collaboratively with the head honchos, shone through. Emery has a load more meetings in the diary for the rest of this week where backroom staff and aims for the transfer window are on the agenda.For all Ivan Gazidis’s talk of a new structure with shared responsibility Emery undoubtedly carries the status of Arsenal’s new figurehead. Out with hashtag MerciArsène and in with WelcomeUnai. There were sudden changes made around the place, making sure the lifesize cutout of Wenger that had been in the tunnel was taken down in time for this unveiling and Emery’s brushed steel nameplate erected outside the head coach’s office. Over to the new man in town to show what he is made of."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/4/1401898140867/1966-World-Cup-Final-014.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4b9ca9878af55356676b04296ff3f73","title":"world cup 25 stunning moments no23 1966","story":"Random tales from the 1966 tournament that have absolutely nothing to do with Azerbaijani linesmen, Kenneth Wolstenholme or Pickles the Dog1. The branding for the 1966 Football World Championship for the Jules Rimet Trophy was all over the shop. But at least Fifa were trying. The 1966 finals was the first to be blessed with a mascot, a small lion wearing a union jack shirt walking along with its eyes narrowed to the point of being totally shut. A myopic nationalist, who’d have thought it. Willie was the creation of the freelance artist Reg Hoye, who had first considered “a little man in a bowler hat” and “a man in a cloth cap” but wished to steer clear of class issues. “I don’t think the result’s pompous,” he insisted, “it’s just to show that we’re not as clapped out as some people think we are.” Hoye was paid a flat fee for his work while the FA creamed off all the profits from the various tat bearing Willie’s grinning boat. “The enormous success of Willie has not made Mr Hoye bitter,” reported the . “Only a little unhappy.”2. Our man Eric Todd’s column on the opening morning of the “eighth World Cup final series” was a remarkably prescient piece of writing. “I believe that the vacillations of temperament will play a crucial part,” he predicted. “Certainly they will be awaited with trepidation in some quarters and with undisguised relish in others where ugly scenes are the beginning, the middle and the end of any football match. Is it too much to hope that no player will be sent off, carried off, or escorted off? … Not every guest will be well behaved, and I have no doubt at all that somewhere along the line discipline, judgment and manners, on and off the field, will be set aside.”3. Argentina, then. In the group stage against West Germany, defender Rafael Albrecht planted his studs in Wolfgang Weber’s fruit bowl, yet he was the one who went away limping. Albrecht was sent off for that challenge, though whether he should have been around to make it in the first place was a moot point, as he’d earlier rather outrageously rugby tackled Helmut Haller. His manager Juan Lorenzo later tried to play down the controversy over that particular tactic by arguing: “A really dirty player would have done it with his foot.” Days later, Nobby Stiles of England arrived late on Jacky Simon of France, fortunate beyond words to stay on the field. Argentina and England would go on to face each other in the quarters at Wembley, and such was the expectation of nonsense that the BBC pundit Jimmy Hill kept a running total of fouls as the match unfolded. After 14 minutes, he announced gravely that England were winning 7-4.4. France were a disappointment, an opening draw against Mexico as good as it got, as they crashed out in the group stage. The signs that they wouldn’t enjoy the party were there from the off, when their supporters were refused permission to let 5,000 balloons into the air before facing the Mexicans at Wembley. The Ministry of Aviation insisted a joyous jamboree of latex would “interfere with flying”. A compromise was negotiated, and fans were permitted to release one balloon into the air every 15 seconds. Organisers ditched the plan altogether, arguing: “You can’t tell 900 Frenchmen that, can you.”5. At least the French fans were initially up for it. The opening match of the tournament featured hosts England and two-time champions Uruguay. Wembley was far from full and the clever punters who didn’t bother to turn up missed a dismal goalless draw. England’s stodgy display attracted pelters from all corners of Europe. Portugal: “England showed little variety of style!” Belgium: “Flagrant lack of imagination!” Austria: “The south Americans sometimes made the technically excellent game of the English look ridiculous!” Holland: “All the swaggering of the English that they are the new leaders of world soccer is nonsense! They failed to combine, failed to score, and particularly failed in soccer intellect!” Given that Holland’s best record at a World Cup finals to this point was played one, lost one, achieved not once but twice in the 1930s, you have to admire the chutzpah. Meanwhile former Liverpool and Scotland star Billy Liddell wrote: “Oh for Tom Finney on the wing! Let’s not talk too much about England winning the World Cup. We ought to be more worried about whether they are going to qualify from their group!” As wide of the mark as the brazen Dutch hack, but at least Liddell knew a thing or two about playing on the wing.6. England got their act together in their next match, beating Mexico (who were staying in Finsbury Park, the age of the seven-star spa retreat having yet to come around). It was a quiet tournament for the Mexicans, though goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal became the first player to appear in five separate tournaments – only Lothar Matthäus has since matched the feat - when he turned out in the final group game with Uruguay. His first cap had come at the opening match of the 1950 finals when, with concrete still dripping from the walls of the newly opened Maracana, and opening-ceremony fireworks smouldering in the goalmouth all around him, he conceded four to rampant hosts Brazil. This would be his last, and the 38-year-old took his bow in style, sticking out a “big boot” to deny Uruguay’s brilliant striker Pedro Rocha, one of the stars of the all-conquering Peñarol, from close range. Carbajal’s World Cup career finished with a clean sheet, his first in 11 matches. He kissed both of the Wembley goalposts in celebration.7. All teams who played at Old Trafford were presented with a Wedgwood jug for the president of the FA and a set of pottery for the players. Good news for Portugal, Hungary and Bulgaria, but pity poor Brazil, who played all of their games at Goodison Park.8. Yes, pity poor Brazil. They went out in the groups. The main narrative arc of their 1966 story concerns the superannuated defending champions being bullied out of it, and Pelé was indeed kicked around like an old sock against Bulgaria and Portugal. But they were simply outplayed by Hungary, whose 1966 side remains one of the great forgotten teams in World Cup history. Here’s the move of the tournament, in the match of the tournament, a sequence of ball-juggling brilliance around Brazil that ended a near miss. But who needs goals? It’s an astonishing ensemble piece, right up there with the Clodoaldo-inspired move that led to Carlos Alberto’s famous strike in the 1970 final, and miles ahead of anything the total footballers achieved with all their interchanging four years later. The ball’s sent raking from left to right by Gyula Rákosi, volleyed back inside by Imre Mathesz, chested down and caressed forward by Kálmán Mészöly, headed back and forth between Ferenc Bene and Flórián Albert, and finally sent whistling goalwards by Bene, who sees his header tipped over by Gylmar. If that had gone in, Hungary should have been awarded the trophy there and then. And we haven’t even mentioned Janos Farkas’s astonishing volley that decided the game. Poor old Garrincha, meanwhile, suffered his first defeat in a Brazil shirt, in what turned out to be his final international.10. Argentina again. And the argument as to whether Antonio Rattin should have been sent off in his side’s quarter-final against England has been raging for the best part of half a century now. Nobody’s any closer to consensus, so we’d obviously get nowhere with that here. Let’s instead try to move the discussion on, because if nothing else, Rattin was guilty of crass stupidity for putting himself in a situation where referee Rudolf Kreitlein’s patience finally snapped. After England started brightly, Bobby Charlton hitting the post straight from a corner after three minutes, Rattin wrested control of the midfield to the point where Wembley’s pantomime jeers and slow handclapping of the visitors had been replaced by anxious groans and worried muttering. Argentina fancied their first semi-final since 1930. Then three minutes of madness. Rattin got himself needlessly booked for a pointless lunge on Charlton. Then, after upending Geoff Hurst, he unleashed a two-minute torrent of forthright chat at the German referee, who didn’t understand a word of Spanish but soon decided he got the general gist. Off you go! Argentina still went on to be the better side, just about, even without their captain, but England dug in and Hurst scored the winner with 12 minutes to go. A small English lad ran on to the pitch to celebrate, and was cuffed round the ear by irate Argentina striker Oscar Más, who may well at that point have been visualising his foolish captain.11. The brouhaha over Rattin had serious implications in the world of boxing, where there had been hope of a unification bout between WBA flyweight champion Horacio Accavallo and his WBC counterpart Walter McGowan. “What England have done to the game of football does not bear a name,” boomed the Buenos Aires southpaw. “If he wants to fight me, he will have to come here where there are no guarantees!” The fact that McGowan was Scottish seems not to have clicked with the irate Argentinian, but the pair never got it on.12. Did England fiddle the semi-final arrangements so they could stay at Wembley? Nope, though the long-held suspicion that they did is nevertheless a result of some good old-fashioned Football Association ineptitude. The press had initially announced that England v Portugal would be played at Goodison Park, but they only did this because they’d been issued with an FA handbook which stated: “If successful in the quarter-finals, England will proceed to Liverpool to play the semi-final tie at the ground of Everton FC.” However, the FA hadn’t bothered to double-check this with Fifa, whose own tablet of stone decreed: “The two matches will be played at Everton and Wembley, but the actual allocation of grounds will not be made until the competing teams are known.” Oh FA!13. Young West German midfielder Franz Beckenbauer was in such imperious form that, rather than evading tackles, he would simply ignore them. He helped his side reached the final, where he and Bobby Charlton cancelled each other out. It was not to be for Helmut Schoen’s side, but no matter, they weren’t that fussed about winning. Schoen impressed upon his squad the importance of not acting like spoilt bairns, given that they were visiting a country their forefathers had rained with bombs only two decades previously. They followed Schoen’s order willingly, and were politeness personified. No detail was too small. Someone sent over 200lb of German bread before the final, but the team donated it to an RSPCA shelter full of hungry monkeys. It was a PR boon. “The West Germans are obviously very satisfied with English bread,” trilled an RSPCA spokesperson. A decent bunch of fellows, then, not that their press corps appreciated them. “I know that if we win some of our people are going to say we have beaten the world, but I hate that,” one German journalist grumbled at the Observer ahead of the final, before making a point that resonates through the ages. “I will not have beaten the world. Eleven German footballers will have won a cup and I will be glad to see it. But I am not saying I have beaten anybody. Of these 11 players, how many at home would I have in my apartment for coffee or beer? Maybe two of them.”14. The German press also had a fairly scathing handle on their counterparts in Fleet Street. “Britain’s sports writers,” we reported sheepishly, “have been described by the Bild-Zeitung, which is read wherever football supporters gather together, as chaps who write their copy in steel helmets and gas masks.” The more things change, eh?15. On the day before the final, Port Vale general manager Sir Stanley Matthews crashed his car into a lorry and was pinned behind the steering wheel. He underwent an operation for an “abdominal injury”, and also suffered head injuries and three broken ribs. Meanwhile prime minister Harold Wilson announced a wage freeze, an economic policy primarily designed to curry favour with US president Lyndon Johnson by proving his determination to defend the pound and improve the UK’s balance of payments. Wilson came back from Washington smiling, sporting a tie with a World Cup motif on it. A penny for the thoughts of struggling freelance artist Reg Hoye.16. Oh all right then. The ball didn’t cross the line. The epigrammatic BBC brilliance of Kenneth Wolstenholme’s “They think it’s all over, it is now!” might have stood the test of time more than Hugh Johns’s jabber over on ITV – “That is it!” – but then Johns went on to enjoy three more tournaments behind the mic while poor old Ken only got the one, so it’s swings and roundabouts. And Pickles the Dog hanged himself on his lead in 1967 while chasing a cat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7d4184da16db822c94e6b752f632cf444e13c3/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b0718305133404facfd333c04ed2ce","title":"while the city sleeps london after hours a photo essay","story":"Photographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensPhotographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensIn the changing rooms backstage at Proud Cabaret in London, half a dozen performers are crammed together preparing themselves for the evening’s shows. As one liberally applies eye makeup, another fills the air with a cloud of hairspray. There are nipple tassels, high heels, leather and wigs. It’s 8pm and the night is about to begin.“There’s always a buzzing atmosphere while everyone prepares for the doors to open,” says Fiona Jay-Brown, one half of the acrobatic duo Deux Ailes. “There are a lot of performers so it does get very busy backstage but we all do our best to get the show on the road. There’s rarely a backstage panic. Whether it’s missing tit-tape or hairspray running out, we all help each other out.”Over at the Houses of Parliament, the scene is quiet and the politicians are long gone. Fire officers Eddie Brennan and Paul Chambers sweep through the House of Lords, past the empty benches, along more than three miles of corridors and down into the bowels of the famous structure, patrolling for potential fire hazards.“It’s a world heritage-listed building and I don’t want to go down as the next Guy Fawkes!” quips Brennan.Drawn from the London Fire Brigade, Brennan and his colleagues oversee numerous government buildings in the area. This past year they have investigated more than 200 alarms and reports of fire “but, touch wood, we haven’t had to fully evacuate the palace in the four years I’ve been working here,” he says.Much of the current palace was built following the devastating fire of 1834. The architect, Charles Barry, used brick, stone and iron to try to minimise the risks of another catastrophe but in the interiors he and Augustus Pugin used vast quantities of highly flammable materials.That said, Brennan notes that people present the greatest risk. “You’ve got people laying data cables next to old plumbing and it’s all out of sight, out of mind you find people propping the fire doors open and forgetting to switch off stoves and heaters and lamps. Even after the latest round of modifications, the palace will always be vulnerable to fire.”Further down the river, another London landmark, Tower Bridge, is also staffed at night. The bridge is raised around 850 times a year for registered vessels with a mast or superstructure of nine metres or more.Tower Bridge was the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever built when it was finished in 1894. The lifting mechanism was originally operated using steam to power the enormous pumping engines these days the hydraulics are driven by oil and electricity while the upper walkway – now a function space with a glass floor offering views directly over the Thames – is lit in vivid pink.With the roads relatively free of congestion, Transport for London begins night maintenance work at the Upper Thames Street tunnel. Opened in 1970, approximately 40,000 vehicles and 4,000 cyclists travel through the half-mile long tunnel every day.“We have only one opportunity every three months to close the tunnel and carry out all repairs, maintenance and cleaning for the next three,” says Stewart Wilson, Asset Operations Manager. “You really feel the pressure when you have a dozen jobs that all need to be carried out at once, before the tunnel reopens.”Westminster has become a European hotspot for homelessness, with more and more people moving to the heart of London in search of hope, opportunity and support. By nightfall, not all have managed to get a roof over their heads.The Connection at St Martin’s, next to Trafalgar Square, provides help for approximately 4,500 people a year its night centre accommodates up to 45 people every night – or more during severe weather – on a short-stay basis.“Most of our clients have complex issues so our approach is to help them deal with trauma and help them to gain independence and get their confidence back,” says The Connection’s night centre manager, Paul Symonds.“They’re really relieved to get indoors at night, to have a nutritious hot meal and to get their heads down. It’s like a pool of tranquility while you’re surrounded by the bright lights and madness of central London.”Symonds adds: “You meet the most interesting characters you could ever hope to meet – that’s the joy of the job. I’ve always felt it a privilege really.“We do have our challenging moments with people dealing with addiction and mental health, but generally it’s very fulfilling.”“London can be rough when you’re on the streets. I’ve had some good times, I’ve had some bad times,” says Ken, one of the residents.“You’ve got to understand that to get into The Connection you’ve got to spend at least four nights on the street. They’ve got to see you sleeping out. There are people who’ve been out a lot longer than that, though. At least here you’ve got a bunk and the staff are quite helpful.”While London sleeps, Spitalfields night market comes alive with traders buying and selling goods. Around 750,000 tonnes of produce passes through the market each year and is shifted by 233 forklifts and about 2,000 employees.The market has been on its present 32-acre site near Hackney Wick since 1992 though its royal charter dates back to 1682 when Charles II granted permission for a twice-weekly market for flesh, fowl and roots.Peter Durber began trading at the market in 1983. “It’s still busy and bustling but it’s evolved to be a very different market over the years,” he says. “It was predominantly white trade with Jewish influence but now there’s a very large ethnic influence which has kept it alive and reflects the ersity of London.”Durber works 12 hours, six nights a week, starting at 3am. “Any sane person would look at the hours we work and think we’re all crazy,” he says. “It’s a bit of a beast but I enjoy what I do and when you have a buzz and you enjoy what you do, the time goes very quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733ddd3872310a02ebc689d88a3a1919a3154f23/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d87207ed84a0644f96bf66adc3dddfb","title":"sharent trap should parents put their children on social media instagram","story":"It’s more and more usual for people to share pictures of their children online – and some have even turned it into a lucrative business. Is it always wrong to mix kids and social media?Follow some bloggers or Instagram stars and you will know more about their children than you do about the children of your closest friends and relatives. You will see them sleeping or having tantrums in their swimsuits in paddling pools or having their nappies changed. You will see their mealtimes, their holidays and what they looked like on Christmas morning. You may have seen them in the minutes after they were born, umbilical cord still attached, and perhaps even before they embarked on this childhood of unwitting digital documentation, in a fuzzy black-and-white ultrasound picture. The ethics of this – publishing photographs of one’s children to build a social media following, and then monetising it – have always been shady, but the issue has been amplified this week.On Mumsnet over the past few months, there have been active threads criticising parenting bloggers or “influencers” – that euphemism for advertisers – mainly about the transparency of sponsored posts and advertising content, but also about the perceived exploitation of their children. The account of one Instagram-user, Clemmie Hooper, was taken down this week and though it is unclear who took it down and why – there were allegations of abusive comments under a post – she has in the past attracted criticism for the use of her children. Hooper’s account, Mother of Daughters, had nearly 470,000 followers and documented life with her four girls. The account of her husband, Simon Hooper, who runs Father of Daughters for his 845,000 followers, is still running – and his posts almost always feature one or more of his daughters. The couple have been singled out this week – neither would comment for this piece – but they are far from the only ones.So is sharing pictures online of our children something we should be worrying about? “In an age of visibility, it is important that parents discuss the pros and cons of sharing with their children, even when quite young,” says Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology in the department of media and communications at the LSE, and one of the project’s researchers. “We interviewed several families where even small children wished their parents would share fewer photos, and consult them more. We observed in a few families that children are even learning to tell their parents to stop. But insofar as this sharing is to bring families together, even when geographically dispersed, there are also advantages, and children appreciate those, too. It’s a matter of respect and consent, and protecting that is important, more than the actual fact of sharing itself.”Are generations of children now growing up without privacy? “I don’t think so,” she says. “The conditions of their privacy are changing, partly because of their own actions, partly others’. What will matter to children is to feel they have agency, respect and dignity – that’s at the heart of privacy. So anyone sharing or using their images should prioritise this.”Genevieve von Lob, clinical psychologist and author of Five Deep Breaths: The Power of Mindful Parenting, says: “More and more parents are questioning the wisdom of posting so much about their kids online. The pictures that are uploaded can form a permanent digital tattoo. Because it’s all so new for parents, we need to start thinking about asking children’s permission to post online.”If you think about how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real riskMost children won’t have the finances to bring a court case, “and a child is normally not considered to have the capacity to bring legal proceedings themselves”. And the implications of such a case on family relationships could be disastrous. Bessant prefers the idea of educating parents and children “so there can be a dialogue at an earlier age. I’ve done research talking to parents about how they share information and what they think privacy is and there are a number of parents who said that once their children start to say, ‘I don’t want those photographs out there’, they would be quite willing to either not post at all, or only post once they have spoken to their kids.”Veronica Barassi, a media and communications lecturer at Goldsmith’s, University of London who is leading the Child Data Citizen research project, says “there is a moral panic” about sharing pictures online. However, she admits there are dangers. “If you think about big data and how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real risk. I’m particularly interested in things like facial recognition: the way in which that data is sold, and the lack of transparency, is the most worrying aspect of so-called sharenting.”It’s important that parents consider the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible digital footprintWhat, then, should parents do? Those setting out with the intention of making themselves and their children famous are one thing. “It’s important that parents consider carefully the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible and widely shared digital footprint,” says Livingstone. “In our interviews with parent bloggers, we found they were becoming more conscious of this, and often taking care only to present their child in a positive light. Of course, it’s possible that this too could be problematic, creating an ideal self that the child must live up to.”As for the rest of us, who have no intention of using photographs of our toddlers to advertise a nappy brand but are still exposing them online, consent is key and “can begin very early,” she says. “Perhaps sharing should be kept to a minimum early on. Sharing photos with a handful of friends and family is one thing. Sharing on public sites is quite another, and I’m not sure parents should do that at all.”Much of it is common sense, says Bex Lewis, senior lecturer in digital marketing at Manchester politan University and author of Raising Children in a Digital Age. “Try not to put their school uniform in, try not to show that you have a regular pattern every day.” Most parents, you would hope, wouldn’t post pictures of their children naked but there are other things parents should perhaps think twice about. It is probably not fair, she says, to show pictures of a child having a meltdown, “although those are quite funny to watch”. Turn off geotagging, which tells internet users where you are, and lock down your privacy settings. Even then, “there is always a chance someone could screenshot the pictures, but someone could take a picture of your child in the park, and if you thought like that you’d never go anywhere. Keep the child involved in the conversation from an early age. The digital world is an everyday part of our lives now. It’s still evolving, so I’m not sure there are any fixed rules, but having a bit of thought about what you are posting and where you’re posting it is the critical thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b866d415cb937366116ed479f019839cdd5382db/0_509_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3cdb89b22af8a672035b3c4bc915116","title":"stir fried ice cream an oddly satisfying thai treat","story":"A creamy mix cooled on a -30C metal plate is scraped into cigar-shaped rolls to make this viral-video-friendly dish. It’s narcotic to watch and even better to eatIn 2015, friends Henry Milroy and Rob Huysinga stumbled across a vendor selling “stir-fried ice-cream” to a crowd of tourists. They were on a night out in Koh Phi Phi, the Thai island group made famous by the film The Beach, and where the storied Maya Bay will close this June to enable its recovery following unsustainable levels of tourism.In awe, they watched the man pour liquid on to a cold grill and, using a pair of paddles, turn it into ice-cream while a crowd filmed the process. After a swim, the pair, now both 23, had the moonshot idea to bring it to the UK. Their first stall was a gazebo, but they currently have four outlets in the UK, some in a pink and blue Citroën CV van, under the name Pan-n-Ice, which sounds like boyband but is actually an accurate description of how the stuff is made. First, a creamy, milk-heavy base is poured on to a -30C metal plate. Toppings are added and, using two spatulas, the mix is chopped and spread into a paste. This is then scraped into small cigar-shaped rolls and stacked in a pot. It is pretty standard in Thailand, Malaysia and Cambodia.Pan-n-Ice make about 500 a day on the weekend most variations cost less than £4, which is bang for your buck given the manpower. The whole process, which takes about 90 seconds, looks like an extended gif – so while its success could partly be down to their spellbinding Instagram feed, I would hazard that it’s the weirder, more private subgenre of “oddly satisfying” videos that have given it a boost. I devour these videos, which fetishise tactile processes such as slicing melons, crushing goo, squeezing warm wax or extracting blackheads. They pinball from satisfying to hypnotic to borderline carnal, depending on what you’re into.But back to Pan-n-Ice: toppings vary, and you can bring your own the Ice Cream Rolls YouTube channel provides solid inspiration. There has been at least one version made with chicken nuggets, another with fries and ketchup. Because it is now food law, Huysinga has made it with avocado. Because of the banter, he has also made it with dog biscuits.My first try was with Oreos and chocolate sauce. I wanted to hate it but couldn’t. It was narcotic to watch the flattening and the rolling, and the result was delicious, with a lightly whipped texture. Crushing the little cigars is certainly oddly satisfying. In the spirit of things, I also ordered the “Mess that was Eton” – strawberries, raspberries and meringue. Was the concoction designed as a takedown of the patriarchal establishment? Or a sly dig at their school, perhaps? Neither: “I played them a few times at rugby,” said Huysinga. “And by the end of it they were definitely a ‘mess that was Eton’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/341773b5b01fca486e4b0ac22d87a239ce86b1e4/527_177_3014_1808/master/3014.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca98aec1eee45f970c7bf2a3b2185722","title":"worlds not jacks oyster 2kg mollusc ruled too short for world record","story":"Organisers of Narooma oyster festival say Guinness world records uses ‘misguided method’ of judging competitors• Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon A regional Australian oyster festival is challenging the Guinness world records’ definition of “biggest oyster” after its prize contestant – a 2kg mollusc named Jack – was deemed too short. The organisers of the Narooma oyster festival say Guinness uses a misguided method that unfairly judges competitors on length rather than weight.“The reason they don’t judge on weight is because it could be harmful to animals – you can imagine cats and dogs and people’s pets can be overfed,” said Cath Peachey, a spokeswoman for the festival. “But you can’t actually overfeed an oyster. The length of the shell alone is not a true indication of size.”Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noonJack’s grower, Bernie Connell, said the rules should be rewritten so his “perfect” oyster could claim the crown. “He’s the heaviest oyster and the widest oyster and the deepest oyster, so three out of four is pretty good,” Connell said. “All things fair they ought to give us the record.“Jack is the perfect example of an oyster: excellent in his looks and well proportioned. You need to know a lot about oysters to get it, but he’s lovely and round, with lovely curves. He’s the perfect shape, like a boat.”At an official event in Narooma in May, Jack weighed in at 1.9kg, 300g heavier than the current champion, a Danish oyster from the Wadden sea. However, Jack was only 27cm long, compared with the record 35.5cm.The festival has written to Guinness to formally request that the width, depth and weight of an oyster should be considered, but does not expect a reply for three months.Guinness requires any measurement be taken three times and averaged, in front of two witnesses, with a veterinary statement that the oyster is healthy and over a year old. The process must be filmed and the oyster “moved on the ground between each measurement”. The festival complied with all requirements.Meanwhile Connell is confident Jack will continue to grow. He is only four, and the Danish champion was estimated to be at least 15 when it broke the record in 2013. The Danish oyster is also a cluster Jack is a single oyster.His plan is to return him to the Clyde river and “not go near him”.“He’s a lovely single oyster,” he said. “He doesn’t have the assistance of other oysters growing off him to make his weight. “I don’t think he’ll grow much longer but he’ll grow a lot heavier. He could get another inch thicker in the next three or four years. It should be enough to win it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587862df72d1df9a0d7b712d394393c14db29d46/22_185_1879_1127/master/1879.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f09397b69494a9727d1898d6ce6e668","title":"buying house should i go ahead","story":"I’m under pressure and facing quite severe depression, and I’m wondering whether to pull outQ I’m currently in the process of buying a property, having to move out of the rented property where I have spent the last few years because my mother was the legal tenant and she has now gone into care since I am no longer able to cope with caring for her dementia.Throughout the process, I have felt pushed for time, friends pressured me into putting in an offer, and I have kept going with the conveyancing even though it has thrown up a number of issues over the title and building regulations approval. I’m also in the middle of a bout of quite severe depression. This is making it very difficult to trust my judgment when I keep feeling that I really don’t want this house. I have spent time sitting outside the house trying to imagine living there and sort out my feelings for it. I have actually told my solicitor to withdraw the offer once, but she persuaded me to take more time to consider it, and I have kind of drifted into keeping going. She is now saying that I will need to make an appointment to sign the contract, and I don’t think I can face doing it. I don’t know how to work out at this stage if this is just nerves and I should keep going, or if I should pull out this late in the day and maybe rent for six months to a year to actually find a place I want to spend the rest of my life in.SSA As a matter of some urgency, talk to your doctor about getting specialist help for your depression, whether in the form of medication or some form of therapy. Depression can affect your ability to think as well as your information-processing and decision-making skills. It can also lower your ability to adapt to changing situations and your ability to take all the steps to get something done. So I suspect that it’s your depression rather than your nerves that is getting in the way of your completing the purchase of the property and I’m not surprised that you can’t face signing the contract.However, I’m not sure that pulling out now would be in your best interests, not least because you’ll still have to pay the legal fees for the work your solicitor has done to date. In addition, a recent survey by the Bank of Scotland found that buying is cheaper than renting.As far as how you feel about the property, you must have liked it enough to put an offer in although it’s perfectly understandable in a period of such upheaval in your life that you’re experiencing cold feet. So I wonder if it would help to take the emotion out of the situation and think of the house in the same way that you would think about a rental property. Continuing with the purchase doesn’t mean that the house has to be your home for the rest of your life. You could think of it as the temporary stepping stone to a longer-term home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8f453bbabce282b32c23ba7c8c7fab189e431b/0_0_3000_1910/master/3000.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9646ee1d99a9c64edd4ffce903647d0a 700w","title":"uk stop blather face reality brexit trade ivan rogers","story":"UK’s former chief EU diplomat Sir Ivan Rogers takes aim at PM’s Brexit strategy in speechBritain must face reality on post-Brexit trade rather than continue the “buccaneering blather” of hard Brexiters, the UK’s former chief EU diplomat Sir Ivan Rogers has said.Rogers, the former chief Brussels adviser to both David Cameron and Theresa May, took aim at the prime minister’s Brexit strategy in a forensic speech on Wednesday, but also criticised the plans of both hardline remainers and leavers, calling them “bluntly, delusional”.In a thinly veiled attack on Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, Rogers said he despaired of “people professing themselves free traders who have only a hazy understanding about multilateral, regional and bilateral free trade deals, have never negotiated one – but know it’s straightforward, once one has left the EU”.Rogers hinted there may still be a permanent deal to be done where the UK would drop some of its red lines in exchange for “quasi-single market membership, paying something for it, living under European Court of Justice jurisprudence and jurisdiction in goods, but disapplying the fourth fundamental freedom, free movement of people”.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.The EU, he said, would have to weigh the cost of iding the “four freedoms” and the benefits of a close deal with a major strategic partner.“The sooner we realise there are no perfect choices, that there are serious trade-offs between sovereignty and market access interests ... and where it is purely notional and actually a material loss of control, the better for the UK.”Rogers, who resigned in January 2017, said all current schools of thought on Brexit, including remainers wishing to reverse the referendum result via a new vote, were “fantasies, or incoherent and muddled thinking”.The UK, he said, had long lost any credibility that it would walk away from negotiations with no deal, first because it was “self-evident” no deal would be vastly worse than even a standard Canada-style free trade agreement, and secondly by the lack of any alternative regulatory preparation.In the lecture at the University of Glasgow, Rogers said May was in danger of “mis-selling the British people” about the trade-offs Brexit would entail.The UK, he said, would not get any serious role on policy-setting from outside the bloc without May shifting her red line on the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. “That was promulgated as a red line when no serious thought at all had been given to these questions,” he said.Brexiters promoting the benefits of a raft of new trade agreements meaning cheaper products for UK consumers should be honest about the consequences, he said. Cheaper bananas could come at the expense of African and Caribbean producers – Commonwealth countries – and cheaper lamb and beef from Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at the expense of British regions. A US trade deal would be contingent on accepting their agricultural standards, he said, a Chinese deal on access for their steel and aluminium, far beyond what the US and EU have accepted.In the speech, Rogers said discussions of post-Brexit alternative models, including EEA membership, the customs union and border scenarios that could be adopted ranging from the Swiss-EU border to the Canada-US border were subject to “extraordinary misconceptions – most inadvertent, some I fear entirely deliberate – of what post-Brexit options there are”.He said his former Swiss and Norwegian counterparts “despair at the mischaracterisation of their models” and the trade-off between sovereignty and maximising market access they had made.“Ruling out these options before truly understanding what either meant, or whether variants on them might be viable, was, in my view, simply an act of folly,” he said.He also took aim at the centring of the UK debate on the future customs arrangements, saying the Brexiters’ preferred option of a technological solution to the Irish border question – the maximum facilitation model – “will never be accepted by the 27 side of the table. Not now. Not in five years. Not in 105 years.”Rogers said the argument that the decision to erect a hard border would be the choice of the EU or Dublin was “simply legally untrue”.He said he also had doubts about the other customs option – the customs partnership favoured by May, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. He said it was viewed in Brussels as “an unprecedented scheme to hand a foreign power the business of collecting revenues at great cost and at clear risk to their revenues”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8f86af4842538bb2c3b192debc33f0987328112/73_0_5037_3022/master/5037.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48b364f666c14f378e528688e242d9c3","title":"nfl national anthem policy","story":"The league will now punish players who choose to protest during the anthem. The NFL owners have given into fear and Donald TrumpThere was a time, not long ago, when the NFL actually stood for something. When the league’s owners acted on principle and were anything but the squishy, invertebrate loafer-and-sport coat-wearing globules they have become. This was in 1991 when the NFL and its owners attacked racial intolerance by yanking the 1993 Super Bowl from Arizona because the state refused to acknowledge Martin Luther King Jr Day as a holiday.“I think it would be an affront to our public and our players if the game was played there,” said the Philadelphia Eagles owner, Norman Braman, who was also chair of the league’s Super Bowl site-selection committee. The league had real power in those days. The insignia that NFL people lovingly call “The Shield” truly was a weapon against injustice, dragging the leaders of an American state from their cowboy past into the modern age. Arizona changed its laws and recognized the King holiday. The Super Bowl was too big a prize to let slip away over racist ideals.In the years since, the league’s owners have grown magnificently rich, building their teams into billion-dollar kingdoms, while also becoming fearful of anything that threatens their ability to make billions more on the backs of fans. So much so that they have let themselves be played by Donald Trump, putting their names on a national anthem policy that might be the most embarrassing document ever issued under The Shield. Trump’s rant last September, when he expressed a hope that NFL owners would say “Get that son of a bitch off the field” to protesting players, should have been easy for the league and its owners to deflect. And yet after a few days of standing against Trump and bigotry they wavered, shriveling in the fire of a president’s tweetstorms. Ultimately, they caved. They gave Trump what he wanted, and this week they finally got those players off the field. With a straight face, the league announced on Wednesday that while players could passive-aggressively stay in the locker room during the anthem, every player, coach, trainer, ballboy, referee and executive on the field will have to stand for the anthem or face punishment. Punishment, the policy said, will come from the commissioner. Potential offenders were identified as “team and league personnel”. Surprisingly, the policy didn’t call them “sons of bitches.”That the NFL even made an anthem policy shows how much Trump has squashed the league and their owners over this issue. The one-page document and accompanying half-page statement from commissioner Roger Goodell, released on Wednesday, contain the phrase “show respect for the flag” five times. And those pages do not acknowledge that the anthem protest started two years ago by Colin Kaepernick had nothing to do with respect for the flag.The protest was – and always has been – a way to draw attention to racial injustice in America. It was supposed to start a long overdue national conversation. Instead, Trump seized upon it as way to throw red meat to the red states, twisting something productive into an attack on patriotism, the military and the nation itself. I know many decent people who work for the NFL, people of honor and dignity, people who believe in treating everyone with respect. I also know many decent people who work for the NFL’s teams. Until today I believed that many of the owners I’ve met in the past to be good and decent people too. Deep down, I think they still are. (Indeed, there are signs some executives are uncomfortable with the new policy New York Jets chairman Christopher Johnson says he will pay the fines of any player who chooses not to stand for the anthem.)But fear does bad things to good people. And Trump, by waving his fake patriotism to fire up old racial hatred, has filled the once-mighty NFL and their owners with worry. They fret their league won’t seem American enough and that television ratings might drop and advertisers, who love nothing more than to drape everything from toothpaste to tires in the stars and stripes, might disappear. The reality is, no one will give up the NFL because a few players kneeled for the anthem. Stand in any stadium on a Sunday afternoon while the anthem plays and see how many of those patriotic-to-the-death fans are chatting on cell phones or slathering their hot dogs in onions or shuffling to the bathroom. Few who go to games even remember the anthem. Nobody buys a $150 seat to hear the anthem. Fans who give up the games are giving them up because they no longer like football, not because of who might be standing or not in the long line of players on the sideline. But such facts don’t matter. Trump and fear have beaten the once-powerful NFL. Any doubt this is an ugly game played by the White House to turn white Americans against black was underscored by a tweet on Wednesday afternoon from vice president Mike Pence. Yes, Trump and his friends are #winning a game. A very dangerous game around racial politics. One the NFL and their owners just lost big time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9941cc6a031826cff74ce2dfbb48517bf1ab1d8b/122_380_1715_1029/master/1715.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0d8a2eacdb888f8891936c2e276b065","title":"premiership pro14 finals saracens exeter leinster scarlets","story":"The irresistible force meets the immovable object when Exeter play Saracens while Leinster are favourites against ScarletsThe season, domestically at least, ends this weekend. As it came in, so it goes out with players queuing for surgery. Artificial pitches have come under scrutiny after Jack Willis, John Barclay and Steffon Armitage suffered leg injuries in the last month that will keep them out of action for between six months and a year but other factors, such as fatigue, come into play.It is not so much the number of matches players take part in but the cumulative effect of training. Mako Vunipola, who last summer was with the Lions in New Zealand where he started all three Tests, will make his 32nd appearance of the campaign on Saturday when Saracens meet Exeter at Twickenham in the Aviva Premiership final.The Guinness Pro 14 final is also being held on Saturday. Leinster take on the Scarlets at the Aviva Stadium, a repeat of the European Champions Cup semi-final last month that was won comfortably by the Irish province at the same venue. The Scarlets endured a burns night in Glasgow last Friday in the semi-final when a number of their players sustained friction injuries on the artificial surface that kept them awake for a few nights and the champions will be underdogs, again. The four finalists had 11 players involved in the final Test against New Zealand last June, nine starters, and two more were involved in the first match in the series.Saracens and Exeter are some distance ahead of the rest in the Premiership, both winning their semi-finals with a degree of comfort that would have concerned the tournament organisers. Had not the Scarlets and Leinster been drawn in the same Pro 14 conference, finishing level on points, they would very probably, with respect to Glasgow, both have topped their groups.The leading four teams in the two leagues are involved on the final weekend, which is not always the case, as last year showed when Saracens, after failing to make the top two in the Premiership as they fought on two fronts, lost at Exeter in the final minute in the semi-final. Leinster were forced to make changes for last weekend’s semi-final against Munster after a bruising European final when they landed a knock-out blow on Racing 92 in the closing minutes, but still had enough to squeeze through.Leinster’s victory over the Scarlets last month was notable for the way they denied a team noted for its ability to win turnovers any succour at the breakdown. They tended to doubleteam in contact, with jackallers such as Tadhg Beirne, Barclay and James Davies smashed out of the way. For all their skill behind, primed by Jonathan Sexton, it was a brutally sustained assault that left the Scarlets with no more possession to do something with than Newcastle had as they found themselves beached at Sandy Park.The Scarlets will miss Barclay, whose five-year career in Wales ended a week early at his former club, and they have to find a way of thwarting the clear-out to allow Beirne and Davies to compete for possession. They will need to respond in kind physically, something Saracens have the muscle to do against Exeter.There was a point in the season when Saracens wondered when they would win again, tumbling to defeat in the Premiership, Europe and the Anglo-Welsh Cup. A club that was a byword for success was in an unfamiliar position, confronting adversity as well as a mounting injury toll. It did not last long and in their last five Premiership matches they have averaged 53 points.Twickenham will resound to the juddering impact of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object. Exeter are unbeaten in their last four against Saracens, achieving the double this season after drawing at Allianz Park in January last year and then winning the play-off, besting the best. There is a danger of the final becoming a stalemate, as showpieces often are, with neither side prepared to indulge in risk but Saracens are hardened winners and, if anyone can force the Chiefs to exhaust their playbook, it is they.The Scarlets are the odd ones out in the quartet with their preference to avoid contact but they will need to muscle up. Their strength lies in attacking unprepared defences off turnover possession, using their angles of running, off-loading, handling and pace to harvest chaos, but Leinster are a side that keep mistakes to a minimum they kick more than Exeter and overwhelmingly won the battle of the skies in the semi-final.The Scarlets will need to find an alternative element of surprise on a day when champions will decide championships. Exeter and the Scarlets are defending their crowns, and Leinster won the Champions Cup this month, succeeding Saracens. It is not 11 months since the Lions drew the series with the All Blacks and this time next year players will be gearing up for the first of their World Cup training camps.The Scarlets players who are in the Wales squad will have no time to celebrate victory or reflect on defeat because they have to be up at 5am on Sunday to fly to the United States for the Test against South Africa the following Saturday.

Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru.“Mr Kohli, who was scheduled to play for Surrey CCC in the month of June, has been ruled out from participating.

The BCCI Medical Team is confident that Mr Kohli will regain full fitness ahead of India’s upcoming tours to Ireland and England.Though England’s bowlers will doubtless be buoyed by the news that the world’s premier all-format batsman will have less time to acclimatise to conditions, it is a blow for Surrey and indeed county cricket itself given the excitement surrounding the deal.Kohli, who scored just 138 runs in 10 Test innings in England four years ago, was due to begin his time playing in the 50-over Royal London Cup, starting at Beckenham, before three County Championship fixtures at Hampshire’s Ageas Bowl, against Somerset at Guildford and then away to Yorkshire in Scarborough.India are due to begin their tour with two Twenty20s in Ireland from 14 June.

Bob O‘Hara has been on, asking about the surest sign that the summer is here: “Morning! Has Gary Naylor emailed you yet?”Actually, you know what...no. We’ll start to worry if play starts and he hasn’t been in touch. We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: the finest hour of English sport that isn’t sport is the hour before the first Test match of the summer. The contented anticipation, combined with the innocence of thought that this is the series or summer could be different to all of the others, is wonderful. This summer is perhaps a more prominent example than most, with England easing into new eras: a new selector with promises of revolutionary (or at least new) thought, a new spinner, a new No.7 (which doesn’t sound especially dramatic, but it is a bit different when it’s Jos Buttler). There are still big doubts over parts of the batting line-up that we’ve doubted for some time, and still there is the looming prospect of having to find a reliable new set as the inevitability of time creeps up on Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson. It’s perhaps appropriate that England face Pakistan, rarely the best team in the world but frequently the most interesting, and unpredictable. That they’re in something of a transitional phase, with untried bowlers and fresh young batsman, makes it all the more interesting. Their win over Ireland was more comfortable than it looked for a while, but other recent results have been patchy. In short, it should be a brilliant series. Now we just have to trust the weather to sort itself bloody well out: London is currently weighed down by drizzle. Stick with us though, it’s going to be great."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b641c186a076e2069408bb2e2b7da6bd74d1444/0_69_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4be1b7196ea852dec309dc2294fccd1","title":"last minute frenzy of gdpr emails unleashes torrent of spam and memes","story":"Inboxes around the world are clogging up as deadline for companies to comply with new regulations nearsA last-minute flurry of emails from companies trying to retain customers ahead of the deadline for Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has prompted a slew of complaints - and memes - on social media.Friday is the last day for companies to comply with GDPR regulations and as a result, inboxes around the world are clogging up with emails warnings that “the privacy policy has changed” and pleas to “just click here so we can stay in touch”.The whole process has inspired the internet to rope in everyone from Julian Assange to Donald Trump to Prince William in an attempt to illustrate their frustration at the electronic onslaught.

It takes Rich and two other men to roll the animal off the sled and on to the ice, while his wife and young children watch.His sister, Natasha Pottle, who shot the bear the night before, hands her brother the plastic bags used to store liver, hair and fat samples that will be sent away for lab testing. The animal will provide valuable information for Labrador’s biologists, a small windfall for his family and meat for the community. Rich has barely begun cutting into the hide when a parade of people from the village start arriving to take pictures, offer observations or just watch respectfully.“When you get a bear, everyone in town knows it,” Rich said.Scenes like this are being repeated up and down the rugged, remote coast this year. Despite vanishing sea ice and shorter, milder winters, Labrador’s polar bear population is actually growing – which means a bigger harvesting quota for Inuit hunters.There are more than 2,500 polar bears in the vast coastal area that includes Labrador and northern Quebec, according to Environment Canada – far more than was expected earlier in the millennium – and further signs the bears continue to rebound despite the impacts of climate change.Indeed, although scientists and Inuit sometimes clash over the estimates, the polar bear population of coastal Labrador is among the healthiest in the world.“When I grew up, a polar bear was kind of this mythical creature because you didn’t see them very often. You didn’t hear tell of people seeing them,” said Jim Goudie, wildlife manager for Nunatsiavut, the regional indigenous self-government.“This abundance of polar bears is not something my father’s generation grew up with. It’s only since the mid-80s there’s been the boom. Now there’s polar bears everywhere.”The reason, biologists suspect, is the boom in the harp seal population. As Newfoundland’s seal fishery has collapsed under international pressure, the harp seals of the north-west Atlantic have proliferated. They now number about 7.4 million animals – more then seven times the population in the 1970s.That has created a veritable feast for Labrador’s polar bears, who have shifted their diet from ring seals to their more southerly, promiscuous cousins.“They jumped on the harp seal boom,” Goudie said. “They appear to have adapted for this moment in time … We’re seeing them further south than in the past.”Labrador’s Inuit have hunted polar bears for thousands of years. But only recently have they been able to so carefully monitor and protect the population, thanks to a unique, indigenous-run conservation program managed by Nunatsiavut.The bear shot by Pottle was one of 12 killed by Inuit hunters this season under Nunatsiavut’s quota system, which doles out bear hunting licences through a lottery. A hunter has one week to get a bear before the licence expires and is transferred to another person. Only Inuit residents can apply for a licence, and it’s illegal to sell a licence to a big game hunter who is not from the region.In Inuit culture, a polar bear remains a deeply respected animal, called Nanuk in the Inuktitut language, and getting one is still considered the mark of a great hunter. The harvest remains such an important part of local tradition that it has its own statute in Nunatsiavut’s land claim with the federal government.But Pottle isn’t putting on any airs. Shooting her first polar bear was a terrifying experience, she said.“I was scared,” she said. “It was intense. We chased the tracks out on to the ice and there he was. Then our Ski-Doo stalled and he started coming toward us. That’s when I started calling for my brother.”Her brother, carrying the rifle on his back, circled around to keep the animal at a safer distance. Then he handed the gun to Natasha and told her to shoot.“She was crying, and I said: ‘What’s wrong?’ She said she’s never going polar bear hunting again,” he said. “I said: ‘It’s your licence. You’ve got to shoot it.’”The bear meat will be ided up and shared among the region’s community freezer program, which provides food for the elderly and others who can’t hunt for themselves. Wasting the meat is prohibited by Nunatsiavut law. Failure to share the meat or submit samples for testing means a hunter can be banned for five years.Inuit hunters can sell a bear pelt for $4,000 to $5,000 to a local taxidermist, who will auction it off to buyers around the world. In previous decades, when the international market for pelts was booming, the same bearskin could fetch as much as $30,000. Under Nunatsiavut’s program, a computer chip is embedded in the pelt to prove it was harvested through a legal hunt.Much like the coastal Inuit themselves, the polar bear’s world relies heavily on reliable, vast expanses of sea ice. As the region’s sea ice vanishes because of warming oceans and milder winters, the bear has had to adapt. The animals appear to be thriving, but winter is becoming increasingly unpredictable.The loss of sea ice has been dramatic, according to climatologist Robert Way. He points to the Canadian Ice Service historical database, which shows Nunatsiavut’s northern region has lost about a third of its ice cover in the past decade.Conservationists say the Nunatsiavut model is a lesson for other regions trying to manage their polar bear population. Goudie argues the Inuit, sometimes criticized by animal rights activists for allowing the bear hunt, have a vested interest in preserving the polar bears that live among them.“For Inuit, it would be like losing an entire piece of their culture,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/658ccc724bef938092ca7f6dcc9dc6f8b5c3a3f0/224_494_2956_1775/master/2956.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34688e2510fb085cc1e982a8d2f42158","title":"thursday briefing if we want it we have to pay for it","story":"Keeping the NHS afloat is challenge of a generation … novichok victim Yulia Skripal speaks for herself … and 65p for a Tracey Emin work of artKeeping the NHS afloat is challenge of a generation … novichok victim Yulia Skripal speaks for herself … and 65p for a Tracey Emin work of artWelcome to Thursday – I’m Warren Murray and it is time to get the news.Britain is finally having to face up to one of the biggest choices in a generation, with every household in Britain needing to pay £2,000 more in tax so the NHS can cope with the ageing population’s healthcare needs, a landmark report has found.Yulia Skripal speaks – “We are so lucky to both have survived this attempted assassination.” The daughter of Sergei Skripal has spoken out for the first time about their poisoning in Salisbury with the Russian-developed novichok nerve agent. “After 20 days in a coma, I woke to the news that we had both been poisoned,” Yulia Skripal said. “I am grateful to all of the wonderful, kind staff at Salisbury hospital, a place I have become all too familiar with.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA day of Dáil confusion over controversial legislation to reform the way judges are appointed has resulted in TDs making laws “in the dark”, the Opposition has said.The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill will now be subject to further amendments in the Seanad after its passage through the Dáil was delayed amid widespread confusion over a number of votes held earlier this week.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl suspended a debate on the Bill – championed by Minister for Transport Shane Ross – on Tuesday night because of scenes which the Opposition described as a “farce”.The Bill sets up a new process for judicial appointments, with a new body given responsibility for recommending candidates to the government. Mr Ross has insisted on a non-legal majority and a non-legal chair for the new body.The confusion arose because a number of contradictory amendments were passed through the Dáil. One such amendment, to increase the membership of the proposed commission from 13 to 17, did not pass.However, other amendments to include the presidents of the Circuit and District Courts, as well as the Attorney General, on the proposed new body to appoint judges was passed. In effect, it meant the Dáil appointed 16 people to a 13-member committee.Mr Ó Fearghaíl and Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said the discrepancies and anomalies in the Bill could be dealt with by the Seanad.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, one of those who highlighted the contradictions in the amendments, said the Dáil was being asked to send flawed legislation to the Seanad.“We don’t know what the composition of the commission is. How do I make up my mind when I don’t know what the nature of it is? We are now legislating blind. I think it shows a real problem in Cabinet, between Minister Ross and the rest of the Government.”It had initially seemed as if the Bill would easily pass the Dáil following a deal reached between Sinn Féin and the Government.Sinn Féin committed to voting for the Bill after the Government agreed to introduce sentencing guidelines as part of an accompanying package.Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire, the Sinn Féin justice spokesman, said his party will continue to support amendments to the Bill to ensure there is a lay majority. He said the new body should not, however, include the Attorney General, which could lead to further difficulties.“It will be our view that we will continue to support amendments to ensure there is a lay majority,” Mr Ó Laoghaire. “There will be a lay majority and the bill will pass.”Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said the co-operation between the Government and Sinn Féin did not mean the two parties are preparing to go into government.“Fine Gael will not be going into government with Sinn Féin,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505620.1527084793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"single people discriminated against on social housing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin called for an online system of allocating most local authority housing. Photograph: Eric LukeThe Single people are being discriminated against in the provision of social housing, according to a national housing charity. John-Mark McCafferty, chief executive of Threshold, said the supply of local authority housing does not reflect the type of people on waiting lists.  The accommodation local authorities build and acquire is mostly three and four-bedroom houses, when single person households make up a “huge proportion” of those on waiting lists, he pointed out.“The available housing not only fails to meet need in general supply, but also does not reflect the population characteristics of the waiting list and the ersity of household types, with an aging population and increasing numbers of smaller households.” Mr McCafferty said there needs to be “a better balance” in construction and acquisition of properties to reflect the nature of waiting lists. He was addressing the Oireachtas housing committee on Wednesday, along with representatives from the County and City Management Association (CCMA) and Department of Housing officials. The committee was examining local authority housing waiting lists. Threshold said its clients regularly report “very long waiting times” for housing but this varies from place to place Andrew Guy, from Threshold, said in Galway some people have been on the list for 14 years. The charity has called for a national policy on the allocation of local authority housing. It said one possibility was a “score sheet” to include points for time on the waiting list and special considerations such as medical needs. Kathleen Holohan, a member of the County and City Management Association said the average time on housing waiting lists varies from local authority to local authority, ranging from less than six months to more than seven years. “Just because somebody is 10 years on the list doesn’t necessarily mean that they didn’t get offers of accommodation. In some cases people have declined many offers of accommodation,” Ms Holohan added. In its opening submission to the committee, the CCMA said the definition of homelessness needs to be clarified or reviewed and those availing of emergency accommodation should be visited regularly and receive active supports to source alternative accommodation. Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin said the primary mechanism for allocating most properties should be Choice Based Letting (CBL). Choice Based Letting allows local authorities to advertise some of their social housing online so approved applicants can express an interest in the available properties. The Dublin Mid-West TD said it is a much more efficient system and gives applicants “some level of control” over the properties that they’re expressing an interest for. He said there are some issues that need to be addressed however, such as applicants who don’t have access to computers or are not computer literate. Mary Hurley, assistant secretary at the Department of Housing, said the scheme is operational in 16 areas across the country and by the end of the year many more local authorities will have it in place. Ms Hurley also said the department has been working with local authorities on “greater flexibility” for cases of domestic violence or similar “specific cases”.

Photograph:  Michael O’SullivanOSM PhotoExcavations at a former brewery in Cork have uncovered the foundations of 19 wooden Viking age houses from the 11th and 12th centuries. Some of the structures date back to 1070, making them 30 years older than any housing previously excavated in the city.The dig at the former Beamish \u0026amp Crawford factory also found three stone walls and a doorway from St Laurence’s Church, dating back to the 13th century.Cork’s urban layout as a Viking city dates from around the same time that Waterford began developing as a Viking city, but archaeologists have yet to find any evidence on Leeside comparable to a trading post established near Waterford in the ninth century, archaeologists have found.According to Dr Maurice Hurley of University College Cork (UCC), who was involved in archeological digs in Waterford and Cork, both cites appear to have developed as structured Viking urban settlements around the same time in the 11th century.“All the cities developed around the same time so there isn’t an awful lot of difference between Waterford and Cork in terms of when they were founded in terms of a formal urban layout where you have a public space, a street and an allocation of property,” he said“But what makes Waterford different is that they have Woodstown – 10km up the Suir – it doesn’t have an urban layout or town structure but there is no comparable Viking site dating from that late ninthearly 10th century period found in Cork – at least not yet,” he added.Dr Hurley was speaking at the launch of an exhibition of artefacts from the late 11th century Viking period found during the excavation of the Beamish \u0026amp Crawford site on South Main Street in preparation for the construction of Cork’s long-awaited €75 million event centre.A team of archaeologists under Dr Hurley excavated the site between November 2016 and March 2018 on behalf of event centre developers, BAM.The excavation found evidence of the earliest urban layout of Cork city discovered to date, with the first houses built at the Beamish \u0026amp Crawford site dating from around 1070, which makes them some 30 years older than housing found at the nearby Sir Henry’s site.Acting curator at Cork Public Museum, Dan Breen, thanked the National Museum of Ireland for lending the newly discovered artefacts to the museum.“The exhibition shines a light on the Vikings’ housing, clothing, cooking methods and religious practices and among the artefacts on display is a perfectly preserved 1,000-year-old weaver’s sword featuring a carved human face,” said Mr Breen.Many of the artefacts are wooden, having been preserved in the acidic marshy ground settled by the Vikings and among the other items found were a collection of spoons, ladles and buckets as well as a wooden thread-winder with a carved design of two horses’ heads, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3506903.1527153675!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord glum faces on no side amid feeling yeses have it","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has voiced his support for a repeal of the Eighth Amendment, saying that the proposed legislation, in no way represents abortion on demand.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has voiced his support for a repeal of the Eighth Amendment, saying that the proposed legislation, “in no way represents abortion on demand”\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            ‘Mattie McGrath (L) complains ever more loudly and angrily about alleged electoral fraud’A beautiful sunny day in Dublin. On the pavement outside Leinster House, a man walks up and down with a sign hanging from his neck.“Yes Voters” it reads. “You should have been aborted.”A woman pushing a baby-buggy shoots him a filthy glance as she passes. “You’re disgusting,” she snaps, hurriedly escaping his noxious presence.International news crews are arriving in the city to cover the referendum, most of them coming from the UK and last weekend’s royal wedding. There is talk that Kay Burley from Sky News has landed.The photocall and press conference production line is slowing down. The Yes campaigners are upbeat. The No campaigners are not.Their respective political supporters reflect the mood. The party leaders are calm and reasoned and cautiously optimistic.While Mattie McGrath complains ever more loudly and angrily about alleged electoral fraud – “Majella from Mayo” got voting cards as did a French lad in Galway. And the disgraceful media bias against the No side has been, well, disgraceful. It’s all one big “stitch-up”.Meanwhile, back to Leinster House, where the party leaders are making their final remarks in the chamber before Friday’s vote. They speak with one voice, and that voice says an emphatic “Yes”.The Taoiseach thanks all of them for their work during the campaign and pays particular tribute to socialist TDs Ruth Coppinger and Claire Daly for their early work in putting the abortion issue on the political agenda in Leinster House, “perhaps at a time when many of us would have preferred not to deal with it”.The atmosphere in the chamber is close to one of relief. There is a definite feeling across all the parties now that the Yeses have it.But not everyone is happy. Sinking retain spirits are confirmed afterwards in the corridors by doleful men solemnly predicting that the No vote in their rural constituencies will not nearly be high enough to swing the result their way.As the leader of Fianna Fáil reaffirms his support for repealing the Eighth Amendment and the proposed legislation to follow, four male colleagues sit in the row in front of him looking extremely glum. Michael McGrath, the finance spokesman tipped as a leadership contender, shakes his head now and then, and sighs heavily, his pinched expression trapped somewhere between distraught and disgusted.Next to him, James Browne from Wexford, another staunch No campaigner, looks similarly stricken. And beside him, Meath’s Thomas Byrne and then Cavan’s Brendan Smith, two more committed anti-abortion TDs. They bury their noses in their mobile devices while their leader and opposing leaders talk of a better future.“I want the people who are worried about this decision . . . and who will vote ‘no’ in clear conscience, to know that if there is a Yes vote this weekend, Ireland will still be the same country it was before the vote. It will just be a little bit more compassionate,” says Leo Varadkar.The four lads don’t look remotely convinced.When talk finally moves from the referendum, McGrath and Browne jump up together and rush from the chamber. Micheál Martin, the one most likely to be on the right side of history come Saturday, watches them go.Earlier, Martin made sure to put on the record that the legislation before the Dáil in the event of a Yes vote “in no way presents abortion on demand nor is it comparable to the legislative regime in the UK. That needs to be said.”He explained the lengthy process whereby that legislation came about. First, the Citizen’s Assembly.“A stitch-up!” declared Mattie McGrath, who was very agitated.And then the Oireachtas cross-party committee.Not happy. But then, outside Leinster House earlier in the morning, there came strange rumblings from the No camp, whose disparate groups appeared to be fracturing under the pressure of possible defeat. Cora Sherlock, deputy chairperson of the Pro-Life Campaign (has anyone ever heard from the chairman during this campaign. Is there one? Where is heshe hiding?), hadn’t appeared at the previous night’s big TV debate, as expected.As anti-abortion campaigners immediately blamed the liberal media’s interference for the no-show of one of their star speakers, Sherlock issued a strange little video, shot in a Spartan, bunker-like room, claiming she hadn’t withdrawn from the debate but had wanted to participate.She was only short of holding up to the camera a newspaper with the day’s date on it to prove she is still in the campaign.Meanwhile, as the news reporters and camera crews fanned across Dublin in search of teenage firebrands and fulminating clerics, the Sinn Féin leader was speaking about abortion pills and one mother’s story of having to watch her teenage daughter bleed at home for three days having secretly taken them.“Are we prepared to look the other way?” asked Mary Lou, as this country has done for decades as Irish women have clandestine abortions. “I’m not. I’m not prepared to look the other way.”Leo Varadkar said that retaining the Eighth Amendment ties the hands of medics who want to look after women properly.“Doctors can intervene to end a pregnancy only if there is a risk to the life of the mother, not a risk to health. To me, a risk to life is a very low bar . . . we can change from a risk to life to a serious risk to the health of the mother,” he said.Ruth Coppinger classed the referendum as “one of the most important votes in decades in this country”. She attacked the No campaign for the “thinly veiled misogyny” of its messages before starting a list of all the social issues its leading lights over the years had opposed.“As well as saying ‘no’ to the right of a woman to have a choice, the leaders of the No campaign have said no to contraception. They said no to sex education. They said no to same-sex marriage three years ago. They have said no to orce, to equal employment, to married women being in the public service, to working mothers, to LGBT+ rights and to gender recognition . . .”The most bizarre intervention came from Fianna Fáil’s Éamon Ó Cuív, who said the other day that we were all unborn once. (Although it might have been a different story for him if his grandfather Dev hadn’t had that US passport after the 1916 Rising when his comrades were being executed by the British.)He told the Taoiseach the prison sentence of up to 14 years on the books for women who have abortions could be reduced by treating abortion as infanticide under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act of 2006. Infanticide, said Young Dev, is now treated as manslaughter “which can carry a very, very short prison sentence”.He also asked the Taoiseach to apologise for saying in the Dáil that he was in favour of decriminalising the abortion pill. Which the Taoiseach duly did.Leo told Éamon he thought he heard him say this, but was happy to stand corrected and acknowledge this isn’t his view.“I didn’t say what my view was, Taoiseach. That’s not what the issue is. The issue was that you said I said something I didn’t say. But my view is a different issue.”That’s cleared that up so.On the subject of infanticide, Leo explained that the amendment holds that the right to life of the unborn, even at one week’s gestation, is equal to the right to life of a pregnant woman. “So the penalty for having an abortion has to be equal to the penalty for killing a pregnant woman, which is not infanticide because, obviously, infants do not get pregnant. The penalty has to be at the level of homicide or manslaughter.”Was Ó Cuív seriously taking the Dáil down this rabbit hole and women taking pills or travelling abroad daily to terminate crisis pregnancies?And how strange is it that a woman gets a lesser sentence for killing a baby or toddler, with her mental health taken into account, but a women terminating a five-week old foetus gets a longer sentence?It would be truly daft, if it wasn’t so awfully serious.Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505854.1527092826!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"obscure provision may permit open border if no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBorder at Newry: Prof Federico Fabbrini says the EU could “declare the entire territory of Northern Ireland to be a frontier zone to the EU customs union thereby removing the need for customs controls (at least on the EU side)”. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyThe EU could use an obscure provision in an international trade treaty to preserve a frictionless border in Ireland in the aftermath of a no-deal, no-transition Brexit, a new report commissioned by MEPs suggests.The report to the European Parliament Constitutional Affairs Committee on the legal institutional implications of a hard Brexit – a prospect which is unlikely in the current state of negotiations, he suggests – has been prepared by Dublin City University’s energetic Prof Federico Fabbrini, director of its Brexit Institute, and will be presented at a meeting of the committee on Thursday. \u0026nbsp It warns that in the event of a hard, no-deal Brexit in which there was no transition arrangement or withdrawal agreement, from April 1st, 2019, “contingency plans would need to be put in place from the EU side to deal with the sudden emergence of a customs border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”. \u0026nbsp That could be done, he argues, by invoking Article XXIV(3) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) , which provides for a so-called “frontier traffic exception”. It is one way of doing what four parties in the North have urged in recent days – keeping the North inside the customs union and single market. \u0026nbsp The clause, which has never been used before, allows that custom provisions under the World Trade Organisation regime which would prevail in both the EU and UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit “shall not be construed to prevent: a) advantages accorded by any contracting party to adjacent countries in order to facilitate frontier traffic . . .”This would allow the EU, Fabbrini says, to “declare the entire territory of Northern Ireland to be a frontier zone to the EU customs union thereby removing the need for customs controls (at least on the EU side)”.Whether the 27 remainer states would be willing to allow such a gaping hole in the EU’s external frontier is not clear – they have been most firm to date in their insistence on preserving the “integrity of the single market” and it would immediately raise questions about how to deal with east-west trade across the Irish Sea.Such a policy might also not completely obviate the necessity for border controls to ensure regulatory compliance in areas like veterinaryanimal health standards.Fabbrini’s paper also argues that a hard Brexit would not mean that the UK would not remain obligated in international law to fulfil its commitments to the current EU budget, which runs until the end of 2020. \u0026nbspPrior to the joint report signed in December, some UK politicians insisted that the UK’s obligations to the budget would cease on Brexit. But the UK government conceded in the joint report that it would honour whatever undertakings it had made in the current budget round. \u0026nbsp Although the Brexit talks are based on the principle of “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”, Fabbrini insists that under the legal principle of “fair play”, “the fact that the UK has already accepted its budgetary responsibilities as a condition of withdrawal implies that the EU will have a strong legal case against the UK for budgetary contributions even in a hard-Brexit scenario”.Although he admits that finding a court with jurisdiction to uphold such an EU case would be difficult, he argues that the UK is unlikely to be willing to test the argument legally.The report also considers the effect of Brexit – whether hard or soft – on the ending of the terms of members of various institutions. Fabbrini argues that UK MEPs should continue to serve after Brexit on March 29th for a further six weeks until the European Parliament concludes its own term and has elections.The UK European commissioner, Julian King, should quit on the 29th, he says. But the UK members of the European Court of Justice should be allowed to finish out their own six-year terms – technically speaking, they do not “represent” inidual states. Leaving them in place, he says, would be “more consistent with the preservation of the constitutional integrity of the ECJ as an institution which has not been tainted by national interests”.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Emergency calls from fatal Washington state cougar attack released: \u0026#39I\u0026#39m so worried about my friend\u0026#39Malaysia\u0026#39s Najib Razak faces second graft grilling and public ire over chocolate theft claimsWest Hollywood grants porn star Stormy Daniels keys to the city to celebrate court battle with Donald TrumpNine a day: The women who have to travel for abortions as Ireland prepares for referendumPrison governors too afraid to make controversial decisions in wake of John Worboys caseWould you break UK\u0026#39s proposed water limits?

The reports also claim that additional fortifications are being constructed and new limits are being imposed on the movement of local residents, along with additional checkpoints on key roads.Please review our commenting policyEmergency calls from fatal Washington state cougar attack released: \u0026#39I\u0026#39m so worried about my friend\u0026#39Malaysia\u0026#39s Najib Razak faces second graft grilling and public ire over chocolate theft claimsWest Hollywood grants porn star Stormy Daniels keys to the city to celebrate court battle with Donald TrumpNine a day: The women who have to travel for abortions as Ireland prepares for referendumPrison governors too afraid to make controversial decisions in wake of John Worboys caseWould you break UK\u0026#39s proposed water limits?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Screens will buzz with static and interference before going blank and entirely silent, leaving viewers staring into the void – or searching for their remote controls – for five long seconds, it wrote.But the reason people are being tricked should become clear soon enough, when the ad spot comes to an end and a message will display that reads: “This is your TV screen ... most of the time a void full of nothing.” The rest of the ad will explain the QLED TV\u0027s technology.The ads will begin on Friday evening, when they will still be relatively short. But they will eventually become even longer – eight seconds of a 30 second ad spot – and will cut right into the middle of the Champions League final when it airs on Saturday evening.Given that many people will be watching that match in pubs and other venues, it seems likely that the controversial ad campaign could wreak havoc in the middle of one of the most watched TV events of the year.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

The two stars are a mere 20 kilometres apart – but they are around 6,500 light years from Earth.One of the stars is a cool, lightweight star called a brown dwarf. The other is an energetic, strange and spinning star known as a pulsar.Scientists spot strange lasers coming towards Earth from \u0027space ant\u0027The gas coming out of the brown dwarf appears to be magnifying the energy from the pulsar, and sending out a bright streak of radiation.The gas is acting as like a magnifying glass right in front of the pulsar, says Robert Main, lead author of the paper describing the observation being published May 24 in the journal Nature. We are essentially looking at the pulsar through a naturally occurring magnifier which periodically allows us to see the two regions separately.The pulsar could eventually destroy the brown dwarf. They are locked together in a system sometimes called a black widow – just as those spiders eat their mates, the pulsars are thought to kill the stars they are attached to.The discovery could help explain fast radio bursts, the intense blasts of radiation that are occasionally sent down to Earth. Those powerful signals are until now entirely unexplained – and have prompted suggestions that they are the result of either undiscovered physics or even artificial technology.Many observed properties of FRBs could be explained if they are being amplified by plasma lenses, say Main. The properties of the amplified pulses we detected in our study show a remarkable similarity to the bursts from the repeating FRB, suggesting that the repeating FRB may be lensed by plasma in its host galaxy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When Labour is elected we will carry through that pledge.”Asked whether he was now going further than the manifesto, he added: “The commitment is clear. And by the way, anyone who is appointed to the House of Lords under existing rules from the Labour party is required to support that.”Mr Corbyn recently appointed former Labour general secretary Iain McNicol, campaigner Martha Osamor and writer Pauline Bryan to the Lords.The House of Lords defeats the government voting to remove the Brexit date from the billBut the strong words from his spokesman also come after more than 80 Labour peers ignored their leader’s will and backed a plan to keep the UK in the EU’s single market.They helped rebel Tory peers to inflict a defeat on the government over the issue during the passage of Ms May’s EU (Withdrawal) Bill – one of 15 her administration suffered in recent weeks.Ms May has also recently appointed nine new peers to the Lords. Questioned on how she justified the new commitments, her spokesman said that the overall size of the Lords had reduced during her tenure.And on appointing ex-ministers, like Peter Lilley and Sir Eric Pickles, he said: “The nominations reflect our determination that the House of Lords should contain people from various walks of life.“But also people who have expertise that can add to the overall contribution the house makes.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

out at least one massacre of Hindu villagers in Myanmar’s conflict-wracked Rakhine state, an Amnesty International report has concluded. Ethnic conflict has convulsed the southeast Asian country in recent years, with the military accused of slaughtering members of the Muslim Rohingya minority in the majority-Buddhist country.But the new report from the human rights organisation suggests that a Rohingya group known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) killed up to 99 Hindu women, men and children while also abducting Hindu villagers.‘Bittersweet’ Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced

saying they were suppressing an armed insurrection after attacks on police posts.The Rohingya have responded by suggesting that their communities suffered disproportionate and undiscerning government reprisals as a result.But while the Amnesty report accused Myanmar authorities of orchestrating a frenzy of “unlawful killings, rapes, and burning of villages” targeted at the Rohingya, driving a mass exodus to neighbouring Bangladesh, it said “no atrocities can justify the massacre, abductions, and other abuses” committed against Hindu villagers.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya Crisis in Photos

crucial as it is for the crimes against humanity carried out by Myanmar’s security forces in northern Rakhine State”, Ms Hassan said.After ARSA members launched an assault on army installations in August of 2017, the report says, Myanmar’s security forces responded with an “unlawful and grossly disproportionate campaign of violence marked by killings, rape and other sexual violence, torture, village burning, forced starvation tactics and other human rights violations”.Security forces targeted all Rohingya in Rakhine state, the report alleges.ARSA responded by unleashing violence on Hindu people, according to Amnesty.

The Home Office remains tight-lipped and government spokesmen have offered little of substance. Visa applications are “rigorous and proper”, Downing Street has suggested, while a security minister has noted that “more cases over the next few weeks could be on their way”. Many questions remain – has Mr Abramovich been denied a visa? If so, on what grounds? Is this a demonstration of muscle before the inevitable new documents are issued? Or has this been directed by Downing Street?Roman Abramovich must reveal finances to get back into the UKAnd this, says the Russian exile businessman Vladimir Ashurkov, is highly problematic. “If the British are trying to send out a message, it is a really weak one,” he says. “Mr Abramovich is one of richest men in Britain, owns a football club, and is a prominent public figure. The public deserves to know what the government really thinks about him.” Mr Abramovich has held British visas for several years. But the rules on his Tier 1 investor visa were tightened in 2015, after his last renewal. Applicants now have to show that £2m of the investments they make into the UK are from legal sources.The oligarch is unlikely to have much problem in doing this, if that is indeed the only hurdle he has to leap. But whatever the British decision actually is, it suffers for being non-transparent, says the author and security expert Mark Galeotti. It would be one thing if he was targetted for being a Russian oligarch, and quite another if the government was acting on intelligence.“If they have some specific information about Abramovich, they should make it public, so the punishment actually has some deterrent effect,” he says. It is also unclear whether the British government decided to move against Mr Abramovich because of coincidence – a visa renewal so soon after Skripal – or due to his proximity to power. Russia warns UK it is \u0027playing with fire and will be sorry\u0027 over Salisbury spy poisoningMr Abramovich is considered to be very close to the Kremlin, but he is not unique in that regard, and is not quite in Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.But the oligarch is also considered a reliable go-to and source of finance for many projects, says Valery Solovei, Professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. And that link has been enough for Moscow to draw its own conclusions. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople protest outisde the Tamil Nadu House after at least 10 people were killed when police fired on protesters seeking closure of plant on environmental grounds in town of Thoothukudi in southern state of Tamil Nadu, in New Delhi.People demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

By attacking Russia’s vulnerabilities – the nexus of money and politics – the conflict with Britain has become not only serious, but also highly personal. “The mood in the Kremlin is that they want to have nothing more with this British government,” he says. “There is no way back for Theresa May or Boris Johnson as far as Moscow is concerned they are waiting for the next elections.” Why it’s a big problem for Putin if the Balkan countries enter the EUThe British moves have been heavily ridiculed in state propaganda. News programmes have suggested the UK is out to punish Russia, whatever the grounds, with Theresa May portrayed as the main bogeywoman. “The average Russian isn’t going to shed tears over poor oligarchs, but the lack of clear reasons has allowed the Kremlin can put whatever spin they want on it,” says Mr Galeotti. “But the rich Russians who once thought London was open to them have begun will now look to find somewhere to go. It doesn’t modify behaviour at all.”  Following tightened legislation and warnings of an impending crackdown, hundreds of millions of pounds of Russian cash has already left British shores over recent months. The trend looks set to continue. “The UK was once considered a safe haven for Russians, but no more,” says Mr Solovei. “Well-off Russians have begun to look for other places to put their cash, nervous about the possibility of new and unpredictable sanctions.” John Woodcock disagrees over comment Jeremy Corbyn was ‘a robust critic of the Russian governmentt for more than 20 years’A parliamentary report published on Monday raised the prospect of a further strengthening of the sanctions regime against Russia. It claimed “dirty money” was in danger of undermining the reputation of the City of London. In its most radical sections, it suggested coordinated moves to make it harder for Russia to raise money on the markets. One of the people interviewed for that report, Mr Ashurkov, said that it is unlikely the UK would gain broad agreement for a move that would likely enrage Moscow further. “That, at present, seems an unwarranted step,” he said. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

celebrated our mums this year with Mothering Sunday, and dads special day is Sunday June 17! Here’s all you need to know...Each year in the UK Father’s Day takes place on the third Sunday of June - which falls on June 17 in 2018.According to one tale, Fathers Day first began because of a woman named Grace Golden Clayton from Fairmount, West Virginia.An orphan, Grace lobbied her local Methodist ministers for a church service to honour fathers in 1908.The story goes that she was inspired to do this after a mining disaster killed 362 local men.Their deaths orphaned more than 1,000 children and Grace wanted to pay tribute to the children’s dead fathers - as well as her own. Another story involves the daughter of a civil war veteran, Sonora Smart Dodd, from Arkansas.While listening to a sermon for Mother’s Day, Sonora became convinced of the need to celebrate dads too.She then campaigned to her religious leaders for a special service dedicated to fathers.In 1966, President Johnson designated that the third Sunday in June should be Fathers Day.Six years later, Father’s Day was made a permanent national holiday in the US when, in 1972, President Richard Nixon signed it into law.While countries including the UK, Ireland, US, France, Cyprus, South Africa, Netherlands, Greece, Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia celebrate Father’s Day every June, others have the day on a completely different date.Instead, Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand celebrate their dads in September.Many people believe that the celebration date is different in the southern hemisphere because June is their autumn, rather than their spring, and the day can be marketed better in the spring season.And in Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and Croatia it’s in March.For Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Iceland, Father’s Day celebrations are held on the second Sunday of November - and in Bulgaria it’s on the same day as Boxing Day, December 26.The dates usually correspond to each country’s culture and traditions.While there may be many different dates dedicated to dads across the globe, one thing is for certain, they all celebrate the same thing –fantastic fathers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dhuhr is observed shortly after noon to again remember God and seek his guidance.Muslims must fast between sunrise and sunset every day in Ramadan.However, they enjoy one meal pre-dawn and one after sunset each day.The Suhur is consumed in the morning, as early as 2.30am, in the latter stages of the holy month.Breads, potatoes, eggs and rice are typically enjoyed as part of the Suhur, in addition to dairy products and fresh vegetables.The Iftar is a blessing, often enjoyed as a community, after sunset. This can be as late as 9.40pm in the latter part of the holy month.Fruits and vegetables are usually big parts of the Iftar, as are many delicacies unique to the Islam religion.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve not sold it and that’s all I’m saying.”According to eBay rules, bids can only be retracted within one hour if there is less than 12 hours in the auction to go. The decision to allow a bid to be cancelled is up to the seller.Payment is only received once the winning bidder officially confirms the transaction - with funds usually transferred by PayPal.Claire was one of the 1,200 non-VIP­ members of the public invited to share in Meghan and Harry’s big day outside St Georges Chapel on Saturday.Sharing her excitement, she tweeted: I got to watch the royal wedding right outside Windsor Castle in this amazing setting. Such an amazing day #Golden ticket #Royal connections.But while some have accused Claire of cashing in - others are also alleged to have taken advantage.The hessian sacks, inscribed with the royal couples initials, contained a welcome letter, commemorative chocolate coin, bottled Windsor Castle water, fridge magnet, official order of service and a tin of shortbread.One seller called Chrisofwilliams, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, stands to make more than £40,000 after putting his commemorative bag on eBay.The gift was initially listed for 99p on Sunday, with the seller saying: Buy a piece of history and memorabilia to celebrate a momentous special day for Britain’s and the royal family.I am selling my limited Goody bag for guests of Royal wedding of Meghan and Harry 19th May 2018.Official bag with full contents containing commemorative chocolate coin unopened sealed and in original condition, labelled spring water bottle unopened and sealed in original condition: royal wedding fridge magnet unopened in original packaging, the castle spectator badge and a tub of ‘handbag shortbread’ unopened as well as a Marriage order of service booklet and a 20% off voucher of middle ward shop in Windsor castle.Don’t miss out on this limited once in a life time opportunity to have a piece of royal history.”The hessian gift bag was given to the 2,640 guests who were invited to the wedding of the year.But many saw the monetary value in flogging off the bag, selling it online.So what does the bag actually contain? - Bottle of Windsor Castle Still Spring Water 500mL- Harry and Meghan Traditiaionl Handbag Shortbread Biscuits- Royal Wedding 2018 Belgian Milk Chocolate Coin 90g- Royal Wedding Commemorative Magnet- Voucher for royalcollectionshopAnother online listing has reached £420 while another hit £411.One of of the listings, the seller declared proudly: “At the wedding today I received this wonderful gift bag for guests.”And the post promised: “I forgot to mention all money raised will go to charity.”Another seller has even been trying to flog PDFs of the Royal Wedding order of service - for £5 each.As the non-VIP guests departed on Saturday the wedding reception turned into an ­outrageous party with a very royal dance-off and “beer pong” games. The Sun can reveal that chat-show superstar James Corden — who was compering the event — instigated an extraordinary dance routine which featured Prince Charles, Prince William and Harry.The royal couple chose I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the fun-filled, early-hours wedding bash.Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36 — now the Duke and ­Duchess of Sussex — let their hair down to the hit by Whitney Houston at Frogmore House, Windsor, where telly’s Corden hosted dinner and fireworks for 200 guests.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

The Government must think again so that people don’t fall into debt or are left at risk of losing their home.”Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd added: “These lamentable figures show that thousands of people have still not responded to the significant changes on mortgage interest loans being pushed by the DWP.This is yet another cack-handed benefit change by the Tories which is wholly unnecessary, and is already causing anxiety amongst some of our most disadvantaged, marginalised citizens.The DWP said that any SMI claimants who havent got a phone call about the change will still get the benefit for at least six more weeks.Those affected are urged to contact the official hotline on 0800 731 0459 for pensioners or 0800 169 0310 for anyone of working age.A spokesman said: Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back.“Everyone who signs up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest, and it’s only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold.“If people decide to decline the loan now but change their mind in future the loan can be backdated so in effect there would be no break in payments.“We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000180243126.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"flight mh370 photo mystery latest news conspiracy theories","story":"Christine Negroni said analysis of pics of washed up wreckage shows the Boeing 777s wing flaps were retracted when it smashed into the sea in March 2014, meaning the plane was out of control when it hit the water.The findings cast further doubt on bombshell claims made by former Canadian air crash investigator Larry Vance.Vance told Australias 60 Minutes earlier this month that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah flew off course on a suicide mission and planned to kill himself and the 238 others on the journey from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur.Mr Vance said: He [the pilot] was killing himself unfortunately, he was killing everybody else on board, and he did it deliberately.And in his new book MH370: Mystery Solved, Mr Vance says evidence suggests Shah tried to ditch the plane as gently as possible to avoid creating wreckage that would make it easier to find.But Ms Negroni has blasted his conclusions as preposterous and absurd — and these photos could prove her point.In a post on her website, she fumed: Ladies and gents, thanks to 60 Minutes, pilots Vance and Hardy are in the cockpit.They’ve fuelled up with alternative facts and are taking us on a flight to the absurd.“Will we ever return from this remote region of reality? Stay tuned.”She accused the show of airing “far-fetched”, “hokum” details — in particular is claims about the wing flap suggesting a controlled landing.Vance had said the wings flaps that washed ashore in 2016 were extended as they would be in a controlled landing.Mr Vance told Australian show 60 Minutes that the flaps were extended, just as they would be during a controlled landing.It lent weight to his theory that the pilot flew on a sinister murder-suicide mission, trying to ditch the plane gently in the water to prevent floating wreckage that could be visible to search teams.But his claim that the flaps were extended has been refuted — as photos show they were in fact in the retracted position.Flaps remain retracted during a flight and are deployed in controlled landings.If they are not extended, it suggests the pilot was not fully in control when the plane went down.MH370 search director Peter Foley said: “If it was being controlled at the end, it wasn’t very successfully being controlled. The flaps weren’t deployed.But Ms Negroni wrote Vance should have revisited that statement when a forensic examination showed the flaperon was very likely stowed, not deployed when the plane crashed.”She pointed to an October 2017 report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which said: It was established from the debris that the aircraft was not configured for a ditching at the end-of-flight.Analysis indicated that the flaps were most likely in a retracted position at the time they separated from the aircraft making a controlled ditching scenario very unlikely.Ms Negronis view has been backed by MH370 search director Peter Foley.He said: “If it was being controlled at the end, it wasn’t very successfully being controlled. The flaps weren’t deployed.One flap is being withheld by French authorities as they carry out their own criminal investigation.But a second flap that washed up in Tanzania in 2016 shows it was “probably not deployed”, according to Australian analysts.Mr Foleys agency did confirm that “it’s absolutely evident” someone had initially flown the plane off course, ruling out some mechanical or electrical malfunction.Various governments and private agencies have scoured the ocean for the main wreckage of the doomed flight but have failed to find it.A total of 239 people were on board, including 153 Chinese nationals, 50 Malaysians, seven Indonesians and Australian, French, Canadian, New Zealander, India, Iranian, Dutch, Russian, Taiwanese, Ukrainian and American nationals.Parts of this article originally appeared on News.au"},{"url":null,"title":"red marks girls ankles nursery staff taped shoes on","story":"Jessica Hayes was horrified to discover staff at the North Carolina daycare centre tied the 17-month-olds feet with masking tape because she kept taking them off.She shared images of her daughters skin bulging over the tightly wrapped tape and clear, dark bruising on her feet.Does anyone see an issue with this? she wrote alongside the photos.

This is untrue and is an unwarranted attack on GMP police officers who, as the actual footage showed, acted bravely in response to this horrific attack.The documentary featured unseen mobile phone video and unheard audio recordings, as well as exclusive access to the emergency services.Mr Hopkins said he and his staff were most deeply concerned about the impact on families of viewing this footage.He added: I fail to see any public interest in footage of such an explicit nature being aired with disregard to the feelings of those who matter most.The GMP chief suggested the material in the documentary breached the BBCs editorial guidelines.The programme, at least by inference, wrongly suggested that GMP officers and staff were held back on the night of the attack. This is untrue and is an unwarranted attack on GMP police officers who, as the actual footage showed, acted bravely in response to this horrific attack. At no point were GMP officers and staff held back and they were immediately deployed to the Arena to save life and protect people. In fact, GMPs Force Duty Officer made a decision not to withdraw officers contrary to national plans, a decision highlighted as courageous in the Independent Review into the response to the attack conducted by Lord Kerslake.I want to make it clear that Greater Manchester Police working within the framework of the National Counter Terrorism Network have had primacy over the response to the attack from the moment the attack occurred and the ongoing live criminal investigation. This is not made clear in the documentary and the style of reporting of this is entirely misleading. As the lead police force, for the response and the criminal investigation, GMP has significant constraints on what we can discuss publicly. The production company approached GMP in Autumn 2017 and after a face-to-face meeting we respectfully explained in detail the legal constraints we worked under and highlighted to the production company their own responsibilities. The production company approached us again sometime later and we reaffirmed this constraint and again declined to participate. It is within this context that the reference at the end of the programme that GMP refused to cooperate, is wholly misleading and was focused only on creating journalistic drama rather than accurately portraying the constraints we have repeatedly highlighted. We became aware, just days before the anniversary, that the documentary was going  to be broadcast and this came from a third party who disclosed the potential content of the programme. At this point, we expressed to the BBC our very serious concerns for the families, especially in relation to any footage of the scene that would show victims regardless of whether these were blurred out or not.We also explained again that GMP is leading a live murder investigation and a warrant was issued in October for the arrest of a suspect. We explained this means proceedings have started and as such we are very mindful of undermining a prosecution. In addition to this, we pointed out that there is an ongoing coronial process and we are again very clear that we should not make comment on matters within the jurisdiction of HM Senior Coroner.We asked repeatedly to view the footage so that we could work with the CPS, Coroner and our own family liaison officers to assess what legal implications it may have, but most importantly so that we could inform  and support families. We were not permitted to do this at any point before broadcast. Consequently the first time the investigation team saw the documentary was at the time of its broadcast last night.In the recent independent review into the response to the Arena attack from Lord Kerslake he voiced specific concerns over the conduct of the media in the aftermath of this tragedy and this documentary serves, in my view, to further illustrate the media’s irresponsibility. This documentary, in our view failed to accurately depict the events of the night, and is a partial reconstruction at best. The production company no doubt will say that organisations were offered the chance to cooperate and they chose not to, but these very organisations have an overriding duty to families and the courts and so cannot cooperate with a production company whose only aim is to provide newsworthy viewing at the expense of the families, coronial process and indeed a criminal trial.Most importantly when I became aware of the content of this documentary, my staff and I were most deeply concerned about the impact on families of viewing this footage. I fail to see any public interest in footage of such an explicit nature being aired with disregard to the feelings of those who matter most. Whether families wish to view such footage is a private matter and is not something that should be publicly aired on national television taking away any choice. Some families are left with the question -  is this my loved one on the floor?.Before the broadcast, I am aware that the CPS and the Coroner expressed serious reservations. I am also aware that having understood the potential enormity of the impact of the programme British Transport Police withdrew support and refused the BBC authority to use the material. Despite all this the broadcast went ahead.The duty of Greater Manchester Police is to support the families, search for evidence of what happened and present this evidence objectively to the courts. This takes time, there is an ongoing extradition process good reason for us being unable to provide detail. Thankfully the vast majority of the media understand and respect this. The broadcast of this programme and the material within it appears to breach the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines.This documentary however, is in our view entirely inappropriate and I deeply regret the impact the actions of the production company and the BBC may have on those who matter most - the victims’ families and survivors of one of the worst terrorist attacks this country has ever seenYours sincerely,Ian Hopkins, QPMChief ConstableGreater Manchester PoliceA BBC Spokesperson said: “The production company worked constructively and appropriately with Victim Support, and the sensitivities of all those involved in this tragic event were subject to careful consideration throughout the production process.This was a responsible, accurate and thoughtful documentary which was an important piece of public service broadcasting. The programme team took considerable care to minimise offence whilst accurately portraying the severity of events.”Featuring interviews with counter-terrorism police and friends of Manchester-born bomber Salman Abedi, the film also explored what could have driven him to kill.He grew up in Britain, where his friends claim he lived a wild youth of booze and drug-taking, but his parents are originally from Libya.The killer is thought to have visited the North African country – a haven for ISIS fighters – regularly in the six years leading up to the Manchester bombing.It was claimed he rang his nuclear scientist mum Samia moments before detonating the rucksack bomb to say: Forgive me.Yesterday, the people of Manchester fell silent as bells rang out across the city at 10.31pm to mark the exact time of the attack one year ago.Thousands gathered in the darkness of St Ann’s Square on Tuesday night, where moving song lyrics were projected onto the side of the church.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The way things are going you could give your kids 20 Rothmans a day and they wouldn’t be much worse off than they already are.And the reason for this is a genuine scandal. A real eye-opener. It shows what happens when people in authority take notice of the people who know absolutely nothing. The Green lobby. The eco-freaks. The obsessive loons. The climate change fanatics.If you’re middle class, you’ve probably got one. They’ve become incredibly popular in the last decade.Trouble is they spew out enormous amounts of something called PM2.5 particles. That’s soot to you and me.They’re the major cause of soot in our cities and the main reason everyone you know is gasping for breath.We’re about to be sued by the European Union because pollution from these stoves is way above acceptable limits.But why do we have them?Because at the behest of the green movement, the government encouraged us all to have them. Burning wood is much better, they said, than gas or coal or oil. Renewable! Doesn’t churn out as much CO2!No, it just churns out lethal amounts of soot. Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them. They’re bad for your health.WHAT a shame – Roman Abramovich can’t get back into the country because we haven’t cleared his visa. So he’s sitting on his yacht somewhere, getting snippy. I’m not sure why we let Roman in in the first place.You don’t get his kind of money by being lovely to everybody, do you?First we helped wreck the Russian economy in the early 1990s by plundering its state run industries. Then we opened the doors to a whole bunch of Russkie gangsters – sorry, oligarchs – with boats the size of Poland. Anyway, I’ll probably end up glowing like a Belisha beacon just for writing this.BROADCASTER Dan Snow has admitted he lies to his daughters.He’s told them that during the war there were loads of female Spitfire pilots. Zooming around, shooting down krauts. He says he doesn’t want them to feel limited by their gender. He should have gone further. Told them that back then Britain was led by a nice lady called Winnie.And that the first person up Everest was a little girl called Hillary. And as for that Ada Hitler . . .THE Iraqis are executing the IS jihadi brides. Loads of them.Some of them are whining that they had no idea their husbands were evil Islamists. One of them said she thought she was marrying a rapper.Yeah, right love. We’ve got a few here, mind.Women who went out to join IS and then thought better of it. They’re lucky we won’t extradite them to Iraq.HEY – got your Royal Wedding gift bag yet? Guests to the wedding are flogging them on eBay for as little as £20,000. Hell of a bargain. I’ve got a bid in on one right now. It says it contains:I’VE got a bit of a soft spot for Victoria Beckham. She’s been criticised for not smiling at the wedding of Harry and Meghan.Some people have suggested Posh Spice was looking a bit grim because David had been out on the pull again. Nah. She wasn’t smiling because, basically, she’s a miserable cow.And I like that. Why should she have to wander around grinning like a village idiot?Keep the sulk and the pout, Vikki, love. Plus I liked what she was wearing at the bash. She was dressed as if for the funeral of someone she didn’t know very well. She looked great.SO, all four of the great American authors are dead. Both Tom Wolfe and Philip Roth died this week.Saul Bellow and the finest of them all, John Updike are already dead.These gentlemen were my heroes when I was growing up. But how long will they be remembered?Updike is already unfashionable on account of his alleged sexism. Wolfe and Bellow were quite right-wing, so the literary critics will quickly consign their books to the “dead white male” rubbish bin of history. And as a consequence, we will have lost an awful lot.Keep their work alive, whatever the critics tell you. Read The Bonfire of the Vanities, or Couples, or The Dean’s December and marvel at the insight and the beauty of the prose . . .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Labour leader’s spokesman said the party chief continues to support joining up the North and Republic. But he stressed Mr Corbyn only wanted a united Ireland through the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which largely brought peace to the province. His spokesman said: “Over the years he has made his position clear that the majority of those people across the whole island of Ireland wanted to see that outcome, a united Ireland. “But in the context of the Good Friday Agreement that can only come about through that constitutional process that is laid down in the agreement, and Jeremy fully supports that.”  Under the terms of the deal, a united Ireland can only be created with the majority consent of people in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mr Corbyn believes that support exists, He is due to visit Belfast today to mark 20 years since the pact which cemented the peace process. It will be his first trip to the north since becoming Labour leader in September 2015. He will call for a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to break the deadlock at Stormont, where power-sharing collapsed in January last year.  Mr Corbyn will say: “Devolution and power-sharing have given every community a voice and helped maintain the peace process. “If the current stalemate in Stormont cannot be sorted out in Belfast, I call on the UK government to reconvene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.

SNP leader in Westminster Ian Blackford said that the Windrush Scandal had revealed that the Tories\u0027 immigration crackdown has targeted those who legally live here. And he raised the plight of young people who have grown up in the UK and know of nothing else face losing their lawful settled status because they simply cannot afford the paperwork. Mr Blackford, who has been damning in his criticism of the Government\u0027s attitude to immigrants, raised the issue at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions. Speaking in the House of Commons he warned that they are struggling to find the money to secure their immigration status because Home Office fees have increased by 148% since 2014.  These children have the right to be here the UK is their home, he said. I am giving the Prime Minister the opportunity today: will she scrap these fees for young people, as she has done for the Windrush generation? The Prime Minister insisted that a minor who has indefinite leave to remain will have access to benefits and entitlements which put them on an equal footing to their British citizen peers, so a grant of British citizenship is not therefore required. But Mr Blackford insisted there were about up to 120,000 young people in the UK in this difficult position.  We are talking about young people who live here, who have to wait 10 years and pay up to \u0026pound10,000 to achieve permanent right to remain. It is shocking.  The Government are guilty of creating a generation of undocumented citizens without the rights that many of us take for granted. Will the Prime Minister change her policies that target young people? The Prime Minister said she did not recognise the \u0026pound10,000 figure he quoted. And she repeated the point that a minor who has indefinite leave to remain will have access to the benefits and entitlements that put them on an equal footing to their British citizen peers. A grant of British citizenship is not required in order for someone to access those rights and benefits.

A transition deal will already last from next March to 2020 - effectively carrying on all EU rules until December of that year. But Britain is preparing plans to ask for a separate customs and regulatory alignment period from 2021 to at least 2023, The Times reported. It comes amid deadlock among Tory ministers, who yesterday refused to say either of their customs plans will be finished on time. Jon Thompson, the head of HM Revenue and Customs, told MPs the Brexiteers\u0027 preferred \u0027max fac\u0027 plan - involving high-tech border checks - would cost firms \u0026pound20billion a year and take three years to complete. The other option is a \u0027customs partnership\u0027 which would see Britain collect tariffs on the EU\u0027s behalf, and firms would apply for refunds later on.  Extending the deadline would avoid the need for infrastructure or checks on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic - the UK’s only land border with the EU.  But it would unleash fury among Conservative Leavers, creating more Brexit woes for the Prime Minister.  She faces a crunch Commons showdown after Chief Whip Julian Smith told Tory MPs the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, heavily amended by the Lords, would be brought back soon after members returned from a short recess. The showdown was widely expected to be announced in the Commons this morning after Mr Smith\u0027s statement to Tory MPs.

She was urged to speak out after American billionaire Shahid Khan tabled a multi-million pound bid for the national stadium. Mr Khan owns the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL American football team, and wants to make Wembley their official home.  It would be the first NFL side to be based outside of the US in a deal reportedly worth \u0026pound1bn. But speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour’s Justin Madders said: I\u0027m sure the Prime Minister, like millions of other people, was glued to her TV set on Saturday watching an event of national importance. Sadly, there was not a fairytale ending, as Chelsea won the FA Cup.  But that could be the last FA Cup final played at Wembley before it is sold to an overseas owner. When Premier League clubs spend hundreds of millions of pounds every year on wages and transfers, does the Prime Minister agree with me that there is actually more than enough money in the game for there to be no need to sell off this iconic national asset? The Prime Minister said: Can I say to him, that is a decision for the owners of Wembley. It is a private matter, it is not a matter for the Government.  Labour deputy leader Tom Watson blasted May’s response. He said: “The sale of Wembley is not a \u0027private matter\u0027 as Theresa May has just said at PMQs. It\u0027s our national stadium and fans have to be heard. We are deeply sceptical of the proposal to sell Wembley.

But just as you need to carefully plan your route to that seaside resort or holiday cottage, it makes sense to plan ahead for the actual journey, too. That way you’ll all still be in the holiday mood when you reach your destination and really ready for fun! Below we’ve teamed up with Halfords to reveal the 5 secrets to the perfect car journey which will leave you feeling relaxed and refreshed when you arrive. They cover everything from picking the right tunes to play on the way to why it pays to plan when you\u0027re off on a road trip. 1. Get the sounds right    A great road trip needs a great soundtrack. But with the whole family in the car, creating a playlist that keeps everyone happy can be a challenge. Even if Dad likes Dua Lipa, Mum likes Metallica and the kids change their minds every few seconds, there is a way to keep everyone happy: using a streaming service en route.  This bank holiday there’s 10 per cent off selected audio systems at Halfords – including a Pioneer car stereo. Featuring a digital radio and with support for Android devices and iPhones alike you can stream from Spotify, Apple Music and use apps like Google Maps and Waze. Remember: Halfords experts can help you with your choice and fit your new stereo seamlessly into your car. The experts can fit your new stereo in-store from as little as \u0026pound30. 2. Keep the kids happy    Keep the kids entertained and you’ll be amazed how quickly “are we nearly there yet” becomes a thing of the past. Whether it’s for big screen classics or cartoons, the Nextbase Car Dual DVD, below, is an ideal solution.  The pack includes two DVD players with built-in nine-inch screens.  You can use each separately, or connect them together to watch the same movie on both. There are speakers to listen out loud, or you can hook them up to a pair of optional wireless headphones. With the ability to play different films at the same time, it will be sure to keep the kids happy - and give you peace and quiet on the journey, even if they want to watch different films.  The chances are that if you’re travelling as a group you’re all going to want to keep your mobile devices charged up. Halfords has a range of portable phone chargers to keep your USB devices topped up – the Halfords Premium Triple USB Charger can charge three devices at once. 3. Don’t get lost    While it\u0027s pretty easy to think of things to fill a long car journey there\u0027s no sense in making it longer than it has to be. If you don\u0027t already have one, or yours is too old to be useful, then consider a new sat nav. You can pick up a great device, like the Garmin Drive, which includes lifetime map updates and traffic camera alerts for just \u0026pound79. The Garmin Drive will also ensure you get there quickly - by rerouting you and diverting you away from traffic.   Halfords also has 20 per cent off a range of other sat navs for the bank holiday, so take a look online or visit your nearest store to find one that suits you. Any questions? Check our Halfords’ Sat Nav Buyers’ Guide. You might also want to pick up a Nextbase Dash Cam, for peace of mind on the road. Halfords also has 20 per cent off on a range of dash cams ahead of the holiday. In-store experts can even fit seamlessly into your car.  4. Watch your levels    Don\u0027t risk something delaying your journey because you remember 10 miles in that you\u0027ve run out of screenwash or that the oil level is low. Why not book a FREE Summer Car Check for your car at a time that suits you. Book online and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level, air conditioning and check for any windscreen chips. They’ll even give you a free screen wash top-up and can top up your oil too. It’s all designed to make your holiday go smoothly and make preparation hassle-free. Halfords’ in-store experts can also fit anything from wiper blades to batteries and from cycle racks to roof-boxes for a small fee.

The 470 Exodus litre roof box, below, has loads of room for extra gear and luggage to keep the car clutter-free.

But a massive World Triathlon advert now covers the frontage, something Sarah and Andy say they weren\u0027t told about when booking their wedding.  Sarah, who met her partner while studying at university in Leeds, said they would have picked somewhere else to wed had they known the banner would be there.

Leeds is really important to us, we brought our children up here and we wanted something that represented our relationship. Sarah said she hasn\u0027t asked for compensation but is simply disappointed by the whole thing.

Emmanuel Elliott, 81, and partner, Hilda Farmer, 79, had parked their Ford Fiesta somewhere near Cheltenham General Hospital in Gloucestershire on Friday afternoon for Emmanuel to attend an appointment. Hilda said she dropped her partner at the entrance and then found a parking spot within a mile and a half of the building, on a street she thought had nice houses on one side. When the couple returned from their appointment, however, their car was nowhere to be found.  Family and friends spent days trawling the nearby streets without success in an attempt to help the Gloucester couple find the vehicle - they even offered a reward on Tuesday of \u0026pound100 to anyone who could locate it. The Fiesta was discovered a day later in the St George\u0027s Road car park about 900 metres from the hospital and had been ticketed three times by wardens. Hilda said she must have dreamt she parked it beside houses. She said her granddaughter played a major role in locating the car after launching a public appeal on social media for locals to keep an eye out for the silver Fiesta.  The post went viral and attracted the attention of local news outlets, with several people soon contacting media to say they had seen the car. The relieved couple\u0027s reunion with their vehicle was filmed by TV crews who had published stories in the days prior about the parking mystery.  Hilda told Gloucestershire Live : It feels crazy. Aren\u0027t we lucky to live in a country where an old aged pensioner\u0027s car gets national news coverage? Thank God we live in England.  My granddaughter has got hundreds of people on her Facebook. She put the appeal on there and someone has seen the car. We\u0027re really happy because it\u0027s the only car we have got. We had to go on our bikes yesterday. I prefer riding my bike to driving a car, but there are some things you can\u0027t do without a car. Emmanuel told the BBC it was marvellous to have found it. He said: It\u0027s been quite a five days. I hope I can remember how to drive.

And now, for the Duchess of Sussex, the serious work begins.  She and Prince Harry were already back on royal duties yesterday at a Buckingham Palace garden party celebrating Prince Charles’ 70th birthday .  But she has made it clear that her role in “the Firm” will be to do more than wear stylish dresses or just be arm candy for her husband.  Shortly after the wedding, her official biography on the Buckingham Palace website was out and in it she boldly announced she is “proud to be a woman and a feminist”. It was a signal she will be using her huge platform to support causes that help the advancement of women. Insiders say she has the blessing of the palace to do so.  It didn’t take long for the haters to pile in at the mention of the word feminist and I must admit that I initially groaned at the thought.  Of course I believe in equality of men and women which, by definition, makes me a feminist. But I’ve always felt excluded from feminism and feminist debates because they’re always dominated by one voice – well-off middle-class women. Instead of being inclusive, it is exclusive and rarely addresses the views and needs of ethnic minority or working-class women. It seems those who benefit most are usually already well paid and well connected. I’ve been to networking events about gender equality in business or the media and I can usually count the number of non-white women on one hand. During panel discussions I never hear anyone talking about tackling the lack of social or racial diversity. Instead it’s a certain group of women fighting for women like themselves. Women of colour have fought against sexism and racism, but their voice is rarely heard. I believe Meghan can change that. Yes she’s well-off and privileged, but her background, and the fact she was raised by a black woman, gives her a different perspective.  As her bio says, she’s had a keen awareness of social issues from an early age, instilled by her wonderful mother Doria Ragland . “Those early experiences helped shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment,” it says.

As police arrive to arrest Dylan Harries he can be seen cradling the youngster - after stabbing Katrina Evemy multiple times in a savage attack on April 13 last year. The teenage mum was stabbed in the eyes, throat, leg and stomach - slicing her liver - and she was also badly bitten during the vicious assault. The 19-year-old was declared brain dead after ‘catastrophic and irreversible’ brain damage two days later on April 19. The footage - which has never been seen before today - features in a documentary which airs tonight with how Dyfed-Powys Police investigated the murder of the young mum from Llanelli is to be aired on S4C tonight.  It includes the moment Harries is arrested. He is seen being frisked by officers, initially appearing calm until the officers attempt to place him in handcuffs. At that point, Mr Harries makes demands to see “his daughter”, and is subdued on the sofa. Harries - who denied murdering his partner of seven-months - was eventually convicted of murder and jailed for 27 years last October. Harries protested his innocence - claiming he found the young mum covered in blood on the floor when he arrived at the house. But he was found guilty by jury after a two-week trial. Just over a year since the attack, Dyfed-Powys Police has partnered with S4C for a Welsh-language documentary on the police’s work on the case. A dramatic collection of police bodycam footage includes the moment officers arrested Mr Harries at Katrina’s address on Graig Avenue in Llanelli. Police reveal tonight how they proved their case against Harries, retracing his movements on CCTV and establishing a motive after digital forensic work on his phone. Just over a year since the attack, Dyfed-Powys Police has partnered with S4C for a Welsh-language documentary on the police’s work on the case. Detective Sergeant Kim Harries said that the case was “difficult and emotional”.  “She was a normal girl, going about her normal day, a young mum with a young daughter,” she said. “The injuries were horrific, like I’ve never seen before. It was very upsetting. “[Harries] was a very jealous, controlling person. And that drove him to a fit of jealous rage. “We instructed a forensic odontologist to look at a bite mark on Katrina’s arm as well as a cast of Dylan Harries’ teeth. His opinion was that it was conclusive that the bite mark had been made by him.” Detective Chief Inspector Ifan Charles added: “There are no winners when it comes to a murder investigation. You have a 19-year-old woman, Katrina Evemy who has tragically died, a daughter who won’t have a mother for the rest of her life and then Dylan Harries had his life ahead of him but made a terrible decision that day. “But I think at least now Katrina’s family have some closure, knowing that Dylan Harries has received justice for what he did.

While filming in Toronto in 2016 the new Duchess of Sussex saw Guy at A Dog\u0027s Dream Rescue in the Canadian city. The beagle had been found wandering the woods in Kentucky and was reportedly days away from being put down. But when the Suits actress spotted him it was love at first sight and she took him home immediately. Now he is living the high life in Kensington Palace and was even thought to have been spotted riding alongside the Queen.  Dolores Doherty, who runs A Dog\u0027s Dream Rescue, told AFP: Guy was living in a shelter after being found lost in a Kentucky forest, and now he\u0027s living in a palace. It\u0027s a fairytale, a real rags to riches story. Guy had only been in Canada for one day when Meghan spotted him, reportedly while looking for a companion for her other dog Bogart, a German shepherd mix.

We\u0027d shown Meghan another dog that we thought might be a good match, but she saw Guy and immediately she wanted to take him home. In November the rescue organisation took to Facebook to celebrate Guy\u0027s new life, upon reading that Meghan was engaged to Prince Harry.  Well it\u0027s official!

Guy was rescued by A Dog\u0027s Dream, and then adopted by Meghan Markle in Toronto a few years ago - the same Meghan Markle that is now engaged to Prince Harry!! How is that for a rags to riches story from a good ole Kentucky Beagle! Adopt, don\u0027t shop!, they wrote. A photo of the Queen arriving in Windsor last week ahead of the royal wedding appeared to show Guy travelling alongside the monarch. The dog bore a striking resemblance to Guy but it is not known if it was definitely Meghan\u0027s dog.

The new Duchess of Sussex will be assisted by Samantha Cohen, 49, who had been the Queen\u0027s assistant private secretary, and is expected to be brought up to speed with protocol and expectations of life with the monarchy. Ms Cohen gave notice of her resignation last September following the ousting of Sir Christopher, 56, the Queen\u0027s private secretary, who announced in July he was leaving after 15 years of royal service. But she has now agreed to stay on as interim private secretary to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, according to The Times. The Duchess of Sussex, 36, is planning to spend six month\u0027s learning how to be an effective member of the royal family, the paper adds.   Samantha, an Australian and reportedly one of the Queen\u0027s most trusted aides, will guide the newlyweds through their first year of marriage.  It is thought Meghan will spend the rest of the year meeting charities and other good causes in a national tour only punctuated by their honeymoon while learning from mentor Ms Cohen, a mum of three.  A source told The Times: It will be six months of listening.  She is seeking out advice from a range of people. She is going to proceed with humility.   It is not going to be quiet, though. It is going to be a very busy office. She has worked every day of her life. She is used to a demanding schedule. Meghan - who announced her retirement from acting following her engagement to Prince Harry - has already made her first official outing in her new role at a garden party at Buckingam Palace to celebrate her father-in-law, Prince Charles, turning 70 this year. The garden party saw 6,000 guests enjoy the sunshine and a speech from the Duke of Sussex celebrating the charity work of his father - despite being momentarily distracted by a bee - much to his new wife\u0027s amusement. It is claimed Samantha Cohen found herself at the centre of an incredibly power struggle between Buckingham Palace and the Prince of Wales last year.  The Queen\u0027s most senior courtier Sir Christopher Geidt announced he was leaving in July last year following 15 years of service to the royal family. Two months later Ms Cohen, the third most senior courtier, submitted her resignation. Sources at the time claimed that the 49-year-old had quit in solidarity with Sir Christopher, who had been ousted following a series of complaints from Prince Charles and Prince Andrew with the Queen backing her sons over her staff.

Kelsie Murphy was celebrating her birthday when the test centre contacted her and told her there had been an admin error. The 22-year-old says her examiner had gone through the test paper with her after she took the exam in Herne Bay, Kent, last month. She says he showed her she had received only six minors and told her: You’ve got yourself an early birthday present- you’ve passed! Kelsie was so delighted she was almost in tears - but her happiness turned to confusion when the test centre got in touch the next day.  She says she was told to return her pass certificate, with a major error having been recorded during her driving test on April 11. It remains unclear how she ended up being given an initial \u0027pass\u0027 result - but the centre has said there was an administrative error. It is thought she is the first person in Britain to have had their licence revoked before even receiving it. Kelsie said: “I have no idea where the major mark came from. As far as I knew, everything had gone smoothly. I feel like the unluckiest person ever because they told me it hasn’t happened to anyone but me.”  The mum-of-two had thought she had passed with half a dozen minors after taking the test at Herne Bay driving test centre. Drivers must have fewer than 15 minor faults and no major errors to pass and be issued with their interim driving licence. Kelsie claimed: “My examiner said ‘congratulations you’ve got yourself an early birthday present- you’ve passed!’ “I was so happy, nearly crying, but holding myself back because I didn’t want to embarrass myself. “I’ve been through a lot in my life and I was over the moon that things were finally going well for me.  “My driving instructor came running over to me because she could see the smile on my face. “The examiner went through the paper with us, showing me that I only had six minors.” Kelsie, from Broadstairs, Kent, was ecstatic to have \u0027passed\u0027 the test after previously failing on her first attempt. She returned home to celebrate with her family and friends, where she was greeted with congratulatory balloons, banners and cards. Her mum had helped her to buy a car, and she sent her papers off to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to get her driving licence. But a day later, while celebrating her birthday, she received a call from the test centre asking her to return the pass certificate to them.  Shockingly, she says they then told her she hadn’t passed after all. A letter addressed to Kelsie, from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency’s (DVSA) Operational Delivery Manager, Mark Aston, said a serious fault had been recorded during her test. The letter, dated April 14, read: “After your test on Wednesday 11th April at 13:35 our in-house checks identified a serious fault had been assessed and recorded during your test but due to an administrative error, your examiner issued a pass. “You can only pass your test if you receive fewer than 15 driving faults and there are no serious or dangerous faults recorded. “With this in mind, I am sorry to confirm that you have not passed your driving test and that you should only be driving in accordance with the provisional licence regulations.” It added: “Finally, please accept my sincere apologies for any upset and inconvenience that this error may have caused.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prankster mows p off field","story":"NewsPrankster mows \"P*** Off\" into field in such huge letters it can be seen from SPACE on Google EarthWARNING - OBSCENE LANGUAGE: The cheeky message - in a field just 10 miles out of Bristol - is only visible from the sky\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTristan Cork09:47, 24 MAY 2018Updated09:58, 24 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA prankster has mowed \u0027P*** Off in HUGE letters in a field in a message so big it can be seen on Google Earth.

Her eyes were closed and she seemed peacefully asleep, with fairy lights around her bed as her favourite music played softly in the background. The image still brings so much comfort to her mum Stephanie because, tragically, Daisy wasn’t asleep, she had died at the age of just 12. It was thanks to a special mattress Stephanie was able to collect such precious memories during a week with her little girl after she had passed away. For the mum and her three other children, being able to say goodbye to Daisy in their own home was crucial to the grieving process.  “She just looked like she was asleep,” the 49-year-old mum says. “It was amazing to be able to feel like she was with us. You have these visions of her looking like something from Silent Witness, lying there in the mortuary, but it was just like having her home again.” Daisy died in 2017 of a rare condition called Costello syndrome, which affects fewer than 300 children worldwide. It is caused by a mutation of a cancer- causing gene, which meant Daisy had a 17% increased risk of developing a cancerous tumour, heart and bone problems. She lived longer than doctors expected but eventually it was too much for her body to cope with. After she died, Daisy’s family were able to take her home to Wimbledon, South West London, for an extra week before they laid her to rest because of the special cold mattress. “When Daisy came home she was in her nightie, we put her duvet on her and tucked her toys around her,” Stephanie says. “I played her music, the soundtrack to Frozen, we had some candles on. My children and I just drifted in and out of her room. It was like she was sleeping. But I did keep expecting her to wake up and say ‘go away!’  “People might hear that and say, ‘Oh my God, that’s really freaky’, but it felt like the most natural thing in the world. I felt I’d reclaimed her. I’d brought her away from a traumatic death and a medical environment and she was just my little girl tucked up in bed.” The technology is not widely available but a small number of hospices have the mattresses. Stephanie, a writer and campaigner, explains: “It’s a blue, plastic-coated mattress and it has cooling fluid and is attached to a tube. It acts like a padded fridge or a freezer block, you put that on the bed and put normal bedding over the top. “I was astounded that there is very little information about these cold mattresses. If Daisy had been under a different hospice, we wouldn’t have been able to take her home after she died. “The most horrific thing for me is that she would’ve had to go to the mortuary. Embalming was the other option, which is horrible. How horrific – you’ve just lost a child and then have to go through that. “The mattresses seem to be really rare, we were so lucky our hospice uses them.” They took Daisy home for a night and then spent seven nights with her at Shooting Star Chase children’s hospice, where she spent so much of her life.  It has been a traumatic couple of years for the family. Stephanie’s husband of 23 years Andy died from cancer a year before Daisy in December 2015, leaving Stephanie as a single mum to Daisy, Theo, 21, Xanthe, 19, and Jules, 15. Being able to spend the extra time with Daisy has been hugely beneficial to them all. Theo and Jules decided that the night with Daisy at home brought them enough closure, but Stephanie and Xanthe spent the rest of the week with her in the hospice, where they re-created Daisy’s bedroom. Stephanie says: “My other daughter spent so much time with Daisy in the hospice, she painted her nails, did her make-up. After Andy died, she didn’t want to be there right at the end. “But actually with Daisy, she said being able to spend time with her and dress her up in her favourite Princess Anna dress, from Frozen, and put all her toys around her was so healing.” Now Stephanie is able to remember her daughter at peace. “Daisy looked so relaxed at the end,” she says. “She had been in a lot of pain for the last few months of her life and was very tense. When she died, we all said how long she looked because she wasn’t tense any more. “In my mind I have that beautiful picture, not on a ventilator and bloated from the fluid, with tubes everywhere. “I have a nice picture. Had I not been able to have that, my last memory of her would’ve been before she went to the mortuary.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teacher who called pupils f","story":"NewsTeacher who called pupils \u0027f****** idiots\u0027 and dubbed board marker the \u0027magic pen of sex\u0027 is banned from classroomElizabeth Woods - a former employee at Hornsea School and Language College, in Yorkshire - also referred to her tutor group as \u0027t****\u0027, a professional conduct panel heard\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Leeson09:46, 24 MAY 2018Updated09:48, 24 MAY 2018NewsElizabeth Woods was employed at the school in August 2013\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn English teacher who called her students f****** idiots has been banned from the classroom.

Ms Woods, 39, who did not attend the hearing, was also found to have sworn at one pupil, as it was revealed she referred to her white board pen as the magic pen of sex, the Hull Daily Mail reports.  The panel heard her behaviour came to light in 2016 when a pupil reported she had stuck her middle finger up at him. Giving evidence to the panel, the boy said he had been told to leave the classroom and waited outside. After about 15 minutes he knocked on the door to get back in.  He said Ms Woods was facing the class and had her back to him as he looked through the glass in the classroom door. He said she proceeded to raise a hand and lifted her middle finger to him. Ms Woods said she used her index finger to point the pupil out of the classroom, but the panel found the allegation proven against her. The boy\u0027s complaint led to an investigation taking place where other students expressed their concerns about her inappropriate language. A student who attended the hearing told the panel he had been asked to leave the classroom because of his behaviour. As he was leaving he heard Ms Woods shout: Am I surrounded by f****** idiots? He said he was shocked by the language she used along with the rest of the class, who fell silent. In written statements, other pupils said she had directed the phrase at the whole class. In her statement, Ms Woods accepted she may have used inappropriate language but did not address the phrase specifically. In an earlier disciplinary meeting at the school she stated she may have used the term idiots under her breath but didn\u0027t say f****** idiots.

Charlotte Bonwick, who has a permanent stoma bag and is fed through a tube, claims she was told by the service to instead get her clean needles from an exchange usually reserved for drug addicts. The 23-year-old, who was born with her intestines outside her body, needs to inject medication every eight hours to stabilise her body, which has been ravaged by sepsis a shocking six times. The West Sussex woman claims she was recently told by her doctor she could no longer have a NHS script for hypodermic syringes.  She also says her regular prescription for anti-sickness drug, Cyclizine, which she needs to inject to help keep water down and weight on, had been reduced to meagre rations and was having negative impacts on her health. Due to absorption problems, I cannot just take a tablet. I have to have medication in other forms, eg. patches which stick onto the skin and release the drug, injections, medication that melts under the tongue, IV through my central line. These medications are so important when trying to live life as normal as possible. Too fearful to visit a needle exchange, the young woman, who is so ill she cannot work, has begun borrowing money from her parents to afford the \u0026pound500-a-month private prescription for syringes. She said: This whole thing came out of the blue, I had no warning whatsoever - it\u0027s made me really upset because now I can\u0027t rely on them.  Whenever I went to go and pick up my prescription they said they lost it - that\u0027s how it started. They couldn\u0027t tell me where the prescription was - it came across a bit strange. I have been on drugs since I was born - it seems they are just phasing me out, they told me that the drugs were just too expensive, but these are the only ones that work.” How am I supposed to take my medication.  Free charity needle exchanges are usually set up to improve the health of drug addicts by giving them a free way to get new needles, rather than having to share. She contacted Mid Sussex East Shoreham CCG to raise her issue . She added: They told me to go the needle exchange. It shouldn\u0027t be about costs, they should be caring for people who need it regardless. Charlotte has started a GoFundMe campaign to try and raise money for her ongoing medication.

Gangland’s “Mr Crafty”, Sidney was the man who stole the Jules Rimet trophy months before England hosted the 1966 tournament, the Mirror reveals today. Until now mystery has surrounded its theft, and what happened to the precious cup in the week before it was found again by a dog called Pickles. But now, with the 2018 World Cup just 22 days away, our investigation tells for the first time the story behind one of the world’s most notorious thefts.   \u0027He was thieving from a young age\u0027: The life and crimes of the man who stole the 1966 World Cup  Armed robber Sidney, then 40, stole the trophy with the help of brother Reg, say three independent sources with knowledge of the heist including Reg’s son Gary. And he did it just for fun, says Gary, who decided to tell the story after he was approached by the Mirror. He said: “Sidney just nicked it for the thrill – not for financial gain, but just because it was so easy.” It led to one of the biggest manhunts in Scotland Yard’s history and became a bigger story than that year’s general election.  But Cugullere died of cancer in 2005, aged 79, having never been caught.  Only a handful of relatives, friends and gangland figures have known the truth. One source said: “Many a time Sid would say he was the first Englishman to lift the World Cup in 1996 and that he did it before Bobby Moore. “He was an opportunist and the stealing of the Cup was just that. He didn’t have any inside information or help from the guards.  It was spur of the moment.” He had tried to extort a ransom of \u0026pound15,000 for the trophy with the help of pal Ted Betchley, but the plan went wrong after his friend was arrested.  Yet still he was not exposed as the culprit.   The Mirror has spent 10 months tracing Cugullere’s history and family after a source disclosed the thief was a man named “Sidney Coo”. Using interviews with insiders, police files and National Archives records we pieced together the most complete picture so far of what happened. Cugullere, jailed for more than 25 years for other offences, took the winged Greek goddess figurine on Sunday 20 March 1966 from the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster, Central London.   History of Jules Rimet trophy as mystery behind stolen 1966 World Cup revealed  It was insured for \u0026pound30,000 and was being exhibited in a glass cabinet by the Stanley Gibbons stamp company.  Sir Stanley Rous, the president of FIFA, had only agreed to it being released from the FA headquarters on condition it was watched 24 hours a day. The exhibition was closed on the Sunday and there were four guards on duty, split into two pairs. One source said Cugullere told him in the 1980s how he had pulled off the burglary.  He had driven to Westminster from his home in Walworth, South East London, to case out security after hearing the Cup was on display there.  Wearing a brown removals-style coat he walked into the area open to the public and went to the locked room where the trophy was housed in a padlocked cabinet. The source said: “There were those door handles you get on schools, the large metal ones, and he realised he could unscrew them and get in. The handle fell and was hanging there.” The handles were holding a wooden bar across the rear doors. Once removed, Cugullere could get inside. The insider said: “Sid had a bag with his tools including bolt cutters. “He said he couldn’t believe it was just in a glass-fronted wooden cabinet with a chain and a little Woolworths padlock on it, and no security watching it.  He cut the chain and in seconds got the cabinet open. When he got it out, he braced himself to lift it, expecting it to be very heavy.  “But he said it was so light it was untrue. He said it wouldn’t have made much as scrap in them days.” Cugullere then put the trophy in his bag and walked out. Gary says his father Reg told him he was also in the Methodist Central Hall, but did not see Sidney take the cup. He said: “On the street after coming out of the doors Sid lifted his jacket and said, ‘’Ere you are, Reg, look at this’. He opened one side of his jacket and the World Cup was there.  “My dad went: “F***ing hell, Sid, what the f*** do you think we are going to do with that?” Back at the Methodist Central Hall, security guards were in for a shock.  Senior guard Frank Hudson was meant to be keeping a constant eye on the Cup with colleague George Franklin on the first floor. Franklin later told police he checked the Cup at 11am before going for a coffee with Hudson.  At 12.10pm, one of the downstairs guards found the padlock on the case removed and the trophy stolen. The next day police issued a description of a lone thief in his late 30s, around 5ft 10in with sallow skin, dark eyes and greased-down black hair. The description fitted Cugullere. Sidney took the trophy home, but soon realised his wife Nell “would have flung him out” if she found it. So he called Reg, who took it home in his car to Leighton Buzzard, Beds.  And that’s when police nearly found the trophy they were all searching for. The source said: “Reggie had it under the front seat. He got pulled at a general stop by the police and they searched the car but didn’t find it.” Rewards totalling \u0026pound5,500 were soon offered for its safe return, far more than Sidney could get if he melted down the 14in gold-plated silver Cup.  DI Len Buggy of the elite Flying Squad led the probe.  His break came when the Chelsea and FA chairman Joe Mears was phoned by a man calling himself Jackson, who said a parcel would be arriving the next day. It arrived three days after the theft, on the Wednesday, and contained lining from the trophy and a ransom note demanding \u0026pound15,000 in five and one-pound notes.  The note, written by Cugullere, said: “Dear Joe Kno (sic) doubt you view with very much concern the loss of the world cup...to me it is only so much scrap gold.” He said the cup would be “for the POT” if the ransom was not paid. Buggy posed as Mears and arranged to meet “Jackson” in Battersea Park – in fact Sidney’s friend Ted Betchley, 46, a former docker.  Betchley was arrested. He insisted he was just the middleman, paid \u0026pound500 for his part, and was jailed for just two years. Gary said soon after the theft Reg and Sidney hid the World Cup in Reg’s father-in-law’s coal shed.   He added: “My dad was freaking out and he knew there was no way they could sell the cup.  They didn’t melt it down or destroy it because it’s the World Cup. They realised they had to give it back.”  Seven days after the theft, on March 27, docker David Corbett was taking his cross-bred collie Pickles for a walk when he spotted the cup in the street. It remains unclear how it got there. Corbett collected \u0026pound6,000 in rewards. Bobby Moore went on to lift the Cup after England defeated Germany 4-2 in the eighth World Cup final.

It wasn’t exactly encouraging.\u0026#8221Mark was 19 when he left Dundee and decided to travel Europe by rail, and it was those experiences that prompted him to write a book, titled Changing Trains.\u0026#8220The main character in the story is Sam, but much of it is based on my own experiences travelling alone in Europe in 1985,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’m a big fan of the novelist Christopher Isherwood, whose books formed the basis for the film Cabaret.\u0026#8220My title is a nod to his book Mr Norris Changes Trains.\u0026#8220Isherwood’s Fraulein Schroeder is remembered in my book as Madame Gilbert and all the young female characters that Sam encounters in my book kind of collectively represent Isherwood’s Sally Bowles.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220When I travelled across Europe in 1985, we were still in the cold war era \u0026#8211 weird to think we could heading that way again now \u0026#8211 and it was pre-Shengen, so I had to go through border controls as I entered and left each country and there was no euro at this point, so I had to get my head around constantly changing my currencies \u0026#8211 pounds to francs to pesetas to lira. This is all described in the book, and I have a little fun with it.\u0026#8221Mark began writing the book in 2010, while he was travelling between his work in London and a small house in France.\u0026#8220I’m a huge fan of Ian Fleming’s James Bond stories and when I travelled to places like Paris, Monte Carlo, Venice and the French Riviera \u0026#8211 all places that have appeared in Fleming’s novels \u0026#8211 it really felt like you were in the world of Bond, so I play with this a bit too,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And when I went Interrailing, I travelled \u0026#8211 as everyone did back then \u0026#8211 with a number of compilation tapes for my Walkman, so the soundtrack to the book is also very 80s.\u0026#8220Everything from Duran Duran’s Bond theme ‘A View to a Kill’ to Simple Minds’ Glittering Prize album. Fab music.\u0026#8221The story starts in Dundee, and Mark said it was central to the story of Sam\u0026#8217s journey from uncertain, undecided small-town boy to a modern, outward-looking European with a sense of direction in his life.\u0026#8220Once the main character Sam has left Dundee and is discovering new cities like Paris, Barcelona and Monte Carlo, he often compares them with his origins. His experience of ‘otherness’ opens new possibilities to him, ones that weren’t available in Dundee at that time,\u0026#8221 Mark said.He initially started looking for a publisher for the book but decided instead to self-publish and said the reviews had been great.\u0026#8220I’ve been amazed at how many people have said it really took them back to that period and reminded them of their own lives back then. I love that it resonates with them,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’ve also done some readings in London and a few guest spots on blogs. But I’m fairly unknown as an author, so it’s a hard slog to get seen and heard.\u0026#8220There’s still lots of work to do.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0288303a011.jpg ","title":"dundee people dundee student lucy gets a good look at cruise ship for school project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the cruise ship Magellan sailed away from Dundee, Lucy Anderson was there to wave it off.The Dundee seven-year-old was studying the Titanic for a school project, her mum Pauline said, and wanted to see how big a cruise ship really was.\u0026#8220We just decided as we knew someone who was going on this one and have never seen any off them leave from Dundee before,\u0026#8221 Pauline said.\u0026#8220We went down to the Stannergate where a lot of other people obviously had the same idea.\u0026#8221Along with her big brother Lewis, 11, Lucy had a good view as the 726 foot ship sailed out to sea.\u0026#8220She was amazed with it and was standing waving to everyone standing on deck,\u0026#8221 Pauline said.\u0026#8220Not sure if it’ll help her but she now knows where the rooms with balcony’s are and ones that only have windows and where the captain is.\u0026#8220It was so good to see and is such a good thing for Dundee at the moment that these boats are coming quite regularly now \u0026#8211 hopefully a sign of more good things to come to the city.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/1-1.jpg ","title":"dundee people pictures may fayre raises 600 for dundee school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt may have been competing with a royal wedding and brilliant sunshine, but a Dundee school\u0026#8217s fayre still raised £600.Lynne Rihoy, Chairperson of the Claypotts Castle Primary Parent Council, said the fayre was a success.\u0026#8220It wasn\u0026#8217t as busy as previous fayres, but given the royal wedding and the fabulous weather outside, we still managed to raise around £600,\u0026#8221 she said.Kids were treated to face-painting, a visit from the local police and other games.\u0026#8220It seemed to be quite popular,\u0026#8221 she said.Lynne said the event was one of two the Parent Council organised each year, with the money raised going back to the school to fund books, school trip, leavers jackets and other things the school couldn\u0026#8217t cover.    \t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b02866b031c0.jpg ","title":"dundee people pupils run for very worthy cause","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne hundred pupils and staff from Perth High School took part in the Perth Park Run to raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust.Teacher Dr Stephen Jones formerly worked for the trust and he also ran in the London marathon, raising £3,000 for this very worthy cause.The Perth High contingent were resplendent in their Teenage Cancer Trust T-shirts as they raced round the North Inch.Dr Jones’ initial goal was to raise £100 for every mile of this London marathon run but he is now on target to collect about £3,000.The other staff members and pupils raised a further £2,600 through their efforts.Dr Jones added: “This a fine gesture by staff and pupils.

Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"livingston star byrne on dundee united radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLivingston promotion hero Shaun Byrne is the latest player to be linked with a move to Dundee United.But the Tangerines will face stiff competition from elsewhere if they do move for him.The 24-year-old was part of the side that clinched promotion to the Premiership by beating Partick Thistle in the play-offs on Sunday.He’s now out of contract and that’s alerted United, Falkirk and a string of English clubs.

proud of stints at both dundee and united but focus is now on hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSought-after Simon Murray’s future will not be decided until July at the very earliest.And while the striker, who’s just finished a loan spell at Dundee, is extremely flattered by interest from the other side of Tannadice Street, his first choice is to remain at parent club Hibs.Murray is currently enjoying his summer break but is well aware of speculation linking him with a return to first full-time employers Dundee United.Beaten Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are also known to be considering a summer move for him and, dating back to his time at United, several clubs in Europe have monitored his progress.As recently as Dundee’s victory over St Johnstone last month, one sent their chief scout to update their file on him.For the 26-year-old, however, the next piece of business he aims to be involved in is a battle to re-establish himself at Easter Road.“I am contracted to Hibs for another year and, although I spent the second half of the season on loan at Dundee, my aim has always been to go back there.“I still finished the season top scorer for them and, even when I went to Dundee in January, the plan was always to go back.“At the time I spoke to Neil Lennon and he stressed whether or not I went was entirely down to me.“I could have stayed and he would have considered me for selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/20180510Forfar1-PR.jpg.jpg ","title":"traders clean up street","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA street has been given a deep clean thanks to business owners.The trio have rolled up their sleeves to rid Osnaburg Street of litter and are now hoping to officially adopt the cobbled stretch of road which leads from Forfar town centre to The Vennel.The nature of the street, known locally as The Pend, means it acts as a wind tunnel which whips up discarded rubbish.Dawn McFarlane of the Osnaburg Bar has called time on the litter louts, along with Neil MacKay of the Pend Emporium and Jacqui Robb of Auntie Jacquis.They said: “We take pride in our street and want it to be welcoming and clean.

wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the border.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the
