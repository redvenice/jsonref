Many are repeat offenders – including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd.Nine MPs have had their card suspended more than ten times over the past three years, including prominent Tory backbencher Damian Collins and constitution minister Chloe Smith.Other Cabinet ministers, or MPs who sit in Cabinet meetings, to have had their cards suspended include Stephen Barclay, Greg Clark, Chris Grayling, Robert Buckland, Claire Perry, Rory Stewart, Jeremy Wright and David Mundell.         They are among the 377 MPs to be penalised since 2015 for breaking the rules by not providing receipts or failing to pay back ineligible expenses.

The rest of the nation would only expect to have to comply in similar circumstances.’Parliamentary credit cards were introduced following the expenses scandal to ensure spending could be closely monitored.Sir Alistair said MPs have ‘clearly become lax’ and ‘casual in their approach in meeting the rules’.He added: ‘If MPs can’t deal with this rather narrow sphere of finances, why should we trust them in dealing with the nation’s finances?’A spokesman for Miss Rudd said: ‘Some payment deadlines were missed by the member of staff responsible for these matters. These issues were subsequently resolved.’A Labour spokesman said: ‘Our MPs’ offices rectify all such administrative issues as soon as they are identified.’Ruth Evans, Ipsa chairman, said: ‘Ten years ago, the difficulty of having politicians self regulate their pay and expenses became all too clear. It led to the establishment of Ipsa.‘Since then, Ipsa has established a clear set of rules for MPs to follow and enforced them fairly. The openness and transparency has become a model for legislatures worldwide.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/08/01/13223308-0-image-a-6_1557274980009.jpg","title":"Royal baby Meghan Markle early stages labour Kensington Palace says","story":"Share this articleLayer up like Meghan in a blue coat by SmytheBuy it at Harvey NicholsThe Duchess of Sussex launched a charity cookbook back in September last year, marking her first solo project as a fully-fledged member of the Royal Family.She looked as elegant as ever for the occasion, combining some of her favourite labels.

Therefore, we unreservedly apologise and accept full responsibility for the mishandling of Jessica Anderson\u0027s application.\u0027Ms Fay added that Guinness will no longer allow fancy dress clothing for the category - and will introduce guidelines \u0027which reflect the clothes worn by nurses in the UK and around the world\u0027.    She said: \u0027The review of this category is the first review of each one of our 200+ marathon titles we will be conducting as a priority, to ensure we do not allow any costumes which bring a profession or any other subject into disrepute. Any we discover will be either amended to reflect modern standards, or deactivated.\u0027Happening concurrently to this is a constant scrutiny of not just marathon record titles, but all of our record titles, as we continue to strive to ensure we create, monitor and catalogue record-breaking feats which truly reflect the world we live in today.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Photos YouTuber Jake Pauls Calabasas mansion aftermath house party","story":"                 The party was attended by Paul\u0027s YouTube star brother Logan (left).

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA housing complex for more than 140 students has been proposed for a site close to the Grangegorman university campus, in Stoneybatter, Dublin, previously designated for 40 standard residential apartments.The five-storey development beside Tommy O’Gara’s pub on Manor Street would bring the number of students living within half a kilometre of the TU Dublin campus (formerly DIT) to more than 5,500, twice the number of permanent residents.Dublin City Council has raised “serious concerns” in relation to the proposed new development and has ordered the developers to “submit a justification for the provision of student accommodation rather than standard residential accommodation on the site”.Local residents, councillors\u0026nbspand a primary school next to the site\u0026nbsphave also objected to the scheme.CSD (Stoneybatter), a developer based in Manchester, wants to demolish the three-storey building which fronts on to the main street in Stoneybatter, and other buildings to the rear, and replace them with apartments for 142 students ranging in height from three to five storeys.Key siteThere was, it said, a “chronic shortfall in dedicated student accommodation supply in the region” and a need for “greater ersity of tenure within Dublin”, which the development would address. The proposed scheme would also see the reuse of a key site which had been vacant for years.The board of management of Stanhope Primary School said the development could deprive the school of adequate daylight and has raised potential “child protection” issues with the complex overlooking its playgrounds.Local Fine Gael councillor Ray McAdam said while he did not object to purpose-built student blocks in general, there was an over-concentration of student accommodation in the area.If this scheme is approved by the council it would bring the number of private student bedspaces planned for the area to more than 3,000 in addition to the 2,500 permitted on-campus at Grangegorman. Census data shows that about 2,600 residents live within 500m of the campus.“I ask the planning department of Dublin City Council to review its consideration of when oversaturation of a specific type of development in one particular district or part of the city has been met,” Mr McAdam said.‘Serious concerns’Green Party councillor Ciarán Cuffe said the application proposed placing a “significant amount of development into a very restricted site”. He raised concerns about “overcrowding” on the site, and the potential loss of pre-20th century buildings.Several local residents have lodged objections to the development, including the residents of nearby Kirwan Street. They noted there were a large number of student complexes proposed for the area which were all being assessed on an inidual basis “with little consideration of the overall composition of the area”.The council has told the developer it has “serious concerns” in relation to “unacceptable levels of overlooking” of the primary school. It has also directed a map be submitted showing all student accommodation facilities within 1km of the site along with a justification for building student accommodation rather than standard residential accommodation."},{"url":null,"title":"more than half of irish men binge drink once a month study finds","story":"Most Irish men, and 40 per cent of the population overall, are classified as heavy episodic drinkers in a new global study of alcohol consumption.Alcohol intake in Ireland has increased since 2010, even as it has fallen in many other western countries, the study published in the Lancet finds.Some 54 per cent of Irish men, and 26 per cent of women, were classified in the study as heavy episodic drinkers. This is defined as having at least one occasion of 60g of pure alcohol intake over a 30-day period.Globally, the study finds targets to reduce harmful alcohol use are likely to be missed as intake worldwide increases. Falls in alcohol intake in many parts of Europe and Russia are being more than offset by increased use in developing countries.Intake grew from 5.9 litres of pure alcohol a year per person in 1990 to 6.5 litres, across the 189 countries surveyed.Alcohol intake in Ireland is about twice this global average, varying from 13.6 litres in 1990 to 12.3 litres in 2010 and 13.2 litres in 2017.AbstentionRates of abstention in Ireland have dropped over the period, from 19 per cent in 1990 to 9 per cent in 2017, suggesting the rest of the population is drinking less inidually overall.The estimates in the study suggest that by 2030 half of all adults in the world will drink alcohol, and almost a quarter (23 per cent) will binge drink at least once a month.Alcohol is a major risk factor for disease, and is causally linked to more than 200 diseases, in particular non-communicable diseases and injuries.“Before 1990, most alcohol was consumed in high-income countries, with the highest use levels recorded in Europe. However, this pattern has changed substantially, with large reductions across Eastern Europe and vast increases in several middle-income countries such as China, India and Vietnam. This trend is forecast to continue up to 2030 when Europe is no longer predicted to have the highest level of alcohol use,” says study author Jakob Manthey, from Dresden University in Germany.The drinks industry contends that binge -drinking is on the decline. Spirits Europe said the modelling study was contradicted by real-world evidence of a reduction in problem alcohol use.“More and more people are drinking responsibly across the world. The World Health Organisation’s own evidence shows it. This study is only a projection while the WHO’s evidence shows binge-drinking is down across the globe,” said Spirits Europe’s director general Ulrich Adam."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3884213.1557258916!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"beneficiaries of ni cash for ash scheme may have to repay money","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe RHI scheme was launched in November 2012, when DUP leader Arlene Foster was minister for enterprise, trade and investment. File image: PAA legal expert has said that if some payments from Northern Ireland’s ill-fated renewable heat incentive are found to be unauthorised under EU rules, the money will have to be clawed back like a “hard-nosed creditor”.The RHI scheme was designed to encourage businesses to switch from burning fossil fuels to more sustainable alternatives like wood biomass.The subsidies proved overly lucrative, paying more than the wood pellets cost, encouraging firms to “burn to earn”.The European Commission made clear that state aid approval for the scheme “is based on a 12 per cent rate of return rather than the associated tariff levels”, and tariffs have since been reduced from the original rate set in 2012.However if previous payments under the so-called “cash for ash” scheme are found to be unauthorised state aid, all the money paid out will have to be retrieved, according to George Peretz QC, from Monckton Chambers.He told the Northern Ireland affairs committee of the UK parliament on Tuesday: “The general rule is that when a unlawful aid is granted... there has to be recovery of the aid from the beneficiaries.“The European court has made that clear over the last decades, that obligation to recover overrides national rules, and that member states can’t refuse to recover aid simply because it creates a danger of insolvency.“It needs to take the attitude of a hard-nosed creditor, determined to get its money back if at all possible. You take up a hard-nosed commercial attitude to recovery, and that’s a strict obligation.“The legal issue is to whether there actually has been overpayment, i.e., a payment outside the scope of the decision, because that depends on one’s view of what the 2012 decision actually was and means.“That’s a legal issue on which two views could be taken if recovery was ever sought, and I’m sure lawyers representing the beneficiaries would be wanting to argue that as far as they could possibly do so.”A number of committee members asked about a possible hardship scheme to help those who would have to pay back the money made from RHI with interest.It was noted that many of those involved are farmers or small rural businesses, and may no longer have the money.Mr Peretz said it was unlikely that such a hardship fund could be established.“I find that quite difficult, as once you have established that a small company has been given a whole lot of state aid that was unlawful, and if the commission was asked about it, it would have said no, but the commission wasn’t asked about it, the company gets the money. The principle is, it should be recovered,” he said.“There are strings of cases that go on to say, unsurprisingly, it’s entirely impossible for a member state, under their own law, to say you can sue the member state and get the money back in damages.“That’s effectively giving you back the aid you should never have got in the first place.“The basic principle is that the state should get the money back and not come up with clever ways to get it back again.”Mr Peretz added that those involved may be able to retrieve some money for additional costs such as legal fees or other obligations that resulted from the payments.The RHI scheme was launched in November 2012, when DUP leader Arlene Foster was minister for enterprise, trade and investment. Controversy surrounding it led to the collapse of Northern Ireland’s devolved government in January 2017, and was the subject of a lengthy public inquiry.Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin is expected to deliver his conclusions later this year. - PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3884170.1557256045!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain and ireland to sign common travel area deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney and David Lidington will sign the agreement in London on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council.

File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsOpposition parties have accused the Government of using the national broadband plan to bolster its chances in the upcoming local and European elections.He said: “It seems to me that it’s an effort by the Taoiseach in particular and his Government to give the impression that they care about rural Ireland. “I think he should well recognise the people are not going to be bought over by this announcement. This is just an announcement about making the one remaining bidder the preferred bidder. No contract is signed today. And I think if it were, we would be in a different position. We’re told that it may take up to six months before a contract will be agreed with the remaining party.“I think the people of rural Ireland who are waiting for broadband will treat this with an air of scepticism and quite frankly I don’t think they have any trust in the Government to roll out such an infrastructure.”Sinn Féin’s communications spokesman Brian Stanley said his party believes the Government deliberately waited until now to make the announcement.“We wanted to see it rolled out seven years ago. We finally had the announcement today. I believe the Government have been sitting on this for months and obviously it’s been announced now, 18 days out from an election but nevertheless it needs to happen and needs to happen quickly.”Mr Dooley said he was “shocked that the rollout time for delivery of project has tripled from three to 10 years” and criticised the fact that the State will not own the infrastructure when the project is completed.He said: “Fine Gael for the past three elections and in their last manifesto and the Programme for Government indicated that it could be done within three to four years.“So effectively what has been confirmed today is a further delay in the roll-out of broadband. We now have a national broadband plan that is covering a third less homes than was originally envisaged. It’s going to take three times longer to deliver. It’s going to cost six times more than it was originally costed at and at the end this one remaining bidder, a private investment fund from Boston, will own that infrastructure which has been paid for by the taxpayer at a cost of €3 billion.”Mr Dooley said the plan was “flawed” and ultimately will not deliver for the taxpayer.“We made it very clear in our facilitation of the Government that there was a necessity to roll out high-speed broadband,” he said.“The Government today is announcing their plan for doing that. In my view it’s a poor plan but it’s their plan. It’s not of our making. If we were doing it, I’ve made it very clear that I would do it very differently and I’m not just saying that now, I said it in 2016. I said it in 2017. “It’s not an ‘I told you so’, but I think what we predicted has come to pass.

A contract hasn’t even been signed yet and the Government is simply announcing a preferred bidder in a situation where there only is one bidder.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3884172.1557256033!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eir may profit from broadband rollout to tune of 1bn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEir had originally been favourite to win the NBP contract but dropped out of the procurement process last year, citing commercial complexities.Telecoms firm Eir stands to make up to €1 billion from the National Broadband Plan (NBP) even though it is no longer part of the process.The scheme, approved by Cabinet on Tuesday, will utilise Eir’s existing network of poles and ducts to bring high-speed broadband to more than 540,000 homes and businesses across Ireland.Leasing this infrastructure from the former semi-State body will, however, cost up to €1 billion over the 25-year lifetime of the contract.This is equivalent to a third of the entire cost of the scheme.It promises to be a lucrative revenue stream for Eir’s new owners, French telecoms consortium NJJ. The price Eir charges for access to its poles and ducts was a major sticking point in the early part of the negotiations.The company insists its wholesale prices accurately reflect the costs involved and were agreed with the regulator Comreg.Procurement processEir had originally been favourite to win the NBP contract but controversially dropped out of the procurement process last year, citing commercial issues and complexities around the tender.Before it exited, it successfully convinced the Government to remove 300,000 homes originally earmarked for the plan, undertaking to service them itself as part of its own commercial rollout.However, the move was seen by many as cherry-picking the quasi-commercial part of the project.The Government’s decision to farm out nearly 40 per cent of the homes in the original intervention area has been one of the principal reasons why the cost of the scheme has ballooned to €3 billion, from an estimate of €1 billion as recently as 2016.Remote locationsThis is because the remaining homes left to be covered are located in the most remote locations, which increases the average per-unit connection costs, and ultimately the subsidy required by the likely operator, US investment firm Granahan McCourt.If the Government had opposed Eir’s move, it could have faced a legal challenge under EU state aid rules, which prevent governments from intervening in areas where commercial entities are willing to operate.It is understood that it will cost on average €1,000 to connect a premises to the new network but that National Broadband Ireland, the newly incorporated company set up to operate it, will only charge €100 to the retailers operating on the network in order to boost take-up.It will be up to each retailer whether they wish to pass this on to the customer.

Photograph: Tom HonanEvery home, school, farm and business in the country will be connected to the internet through high-speed broadband within seven years at a cost to the State of no more than €3 billion, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar pledged on Tuesday, dismissing concerns about the cost, structure and likely take-up of the scheme. Mr Varadkar hailed “a very significant day for our country” as he announced a preferred bidder for the largest single contract in the history of the State and the effective go-ahead for a project that has been dogged by delays, controversy and objections from high-ranking officials. As expected, the preferred bidder is the sole remaining entrant in the competition, National Broadband Ireland, a consortium led by the US businessman David McCourt. Mr Varadkar said in the future people would not ask why the project had cost so much, but why it was not done sooner. “We must pay the price of progress now, or we risk staying trapped in the past forever,” Mr Varadkar said.However, opposition parties and some industry experts continued to question the plan, with one senior source dismissing as completely unrealistic Government claims that the scheme would have an 80 per cent take-up within five years – an estimate that would put it far ahead of the rate seen by commercial providers.But Ministers brushed aside concerns about the cost of the project and the likely take-up rate at a press conference following the Cabinet meeting.Public spendingMinister for Finance and Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said his department had “very robustly” performed its “challenge function” to ensure sustainable public spending. He promised to publish correspondence between his officials and other stakeholders outlining the department’s objections and criticisms of the scheme, though his spokeswoman said last night that this would not be done until Wednesday. Senior officials in Mr Donohoe’s department were opposed to the plan because they felt it did not represent value for money, and took the unprecedented step of registering their objections in formal Cabinet documentation.However, Mr Donohoe said he believed that alternatives could not deliver 100 per cent coverage any more cheaply and that, considering the long-term benefits of the project, he supported the adoption of the plan “on balance”.Mr Donohoe said while officials had supplied him with advice on the plan, it was up to him and the rest of the Cabinet to make the decisions for the future of the country, and both the Taoiseach and Ministers stressed the long-term benefits of the broadband rollout.Electrification comparisonMinister for Communications Richard Bruton likened the provision of broadband to the supply of water and electricity, while the Taoiseach repeatedly drew parallels with the rural electrification scheme, which brought electricity to every home in the country between the 1940s and 1970s.The contract is likely to be signed in about six months, Mr Bruton said, with work commencing next year. There are no additional costs for the exchequer this year, but officials said money for the additional capital expenditure would have to be found the following year.Opposition parties said the announcement was directly linked to the forthcoming elections. Fianna Fáil communications spokesman Timmy Dooley said it had “all the hallmarks of a PR exercise two weeks out from a local and a European election”.Labour leader Brendan Howlin accused Fine Gael of putting electoral politics before the public good. “Labour wants to see rural broadband delivered, but this plan risks leaving people in rural Ireland totally dependent on a private monopoly, which will ultimately be able to charge what it wants for access to the internet,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent

last great wilderness jeopardy autocratic president","story":"How the Stiegler’s Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station will lookIt is arguably the Empire’s greatest legacy to conservation, the outrageous vision of a British poacher-turned-naturalist whose misanthropic cussedness would shape Africa’s largest wildlife sanctuary.Stretching across a swathe of woodland savannah four-fifths the size of the Republic of Ireland, the Selous Game Reserve in southern Tanzania is among the world’s biggest protected wildernesses, home, until Africa’s latest poaching frenzy, to one of the largest elephant concentrations on the continent.For much of its 123-year history, the Selous has been threatened, coveted by prospectors and industrialists who saw in its untouched vastness the possibility of equally vast wealth.Until this year the profit-seekers had been held back.That is about to change, with work beginning on a development that will forever change the Selous’ landscape.A herd of African Elephants approaching the shore of Lake Manze in the Selous Game ReserveKicking up plumes of dust that scatter the grazing wildlife, a relentless flow of bulldozers, water tankers and lorries trundles along the main track across the northwest of the reserve towards Stiegler’s Gorge.For decades, tourist and hunting lodges aside, the only permanent structures in the reserve were two tombstones. One marked the grave of Sir Frederick Selous, the imperial adventurer after whom the reserve is named, the other that of Constantine Ionides, a snake-collecting English eccentric who made the reserve what it is today.But now, in Stiegler’s 330-foot deep canyon along the River Rufiji, construction is underway — with the undeclared assistance of China — on one of the world’s largest dams, the first time such a project has ever taken place in a Unesco World Heritage site.Conservationists, who have quietly been celebrating a decline in poaching in recent years, see it as a catastrophe, with Unesco’s World Heritage Committee warning of “a high likelihood of serious and irreversible damage”.For them, it is more than a mere eyesore. The dam will upend the reserve’s fragile ecosystem, reduce the habitat of the wildlife that has thrived in it and embolden further human encroachment.Worried Western donors, too, have lobbied Tanzania to halt the development, arguing that the dam is unlikely ever to work and could even bankrupt the country.“It is a colossal white elephant, ruinous in every way,” an economist based in Tanzania says. “It is hard to think of a project more ill-conceived.”A relentless flow of bulldozers, water tankers and lorries trundles along the main track across the northwest of the reserve towards Stiegler’s GorgeSuch criticisms are voiced quietly. John Magufuli, Tanzania’s president, brooks neither domestic nor Western criticism. Since he came to power in 2015, independent newspapers have been closed and 20 opposition MPs arrested. One of the president’s foremost parliamentary critics was shot 16 times in 2017. Questioning the dam in public is risky, as the government has gone to pains to point out.“The government will go on with the implementation of the project whether you like it or not,” Kangi Lugola, Tanzania’s environment minister, told parliament last year. “Those who resist the project will be jailed.”For the president, the ends justify the means. The Stiegler’s Gorge Dam would more than double the electricity Tanzania generates, could set Tanzania on the road to industrialisation and bring power to the two-thirds of his people without it.For his critics, however, the dam is just another vanity project by a president who prizes grandiosity over realism, one likely to become yet another vehicle for corrupt government officials to pocket cash.Little the president says about the dam is grounded in reality, they say. A forecast completion date of 2021 will probably overrun by at least six years, western experts reckon costs could spiral to £7.6 billion, treble the project’s present budget, making a return on investment unlikely.Tanzania\u0026#39s President John Magufuli walks alongside President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of EgyptMoreover, a feasibility study projecting the dam’s likely generation capacity was conducted quarter of a century ago, before upstream irrigation and climate change reduced water levels in the Rufiji.“The river has lost 25 per cent of its capacity in the past 25 years,” says Zitto Kabwe, an economist and leading opposition politician who has frequently been arrested for criticising the government. “It is not possible to produce the electricity talked about.”The funding, too, is murky. Mr Magufuli insists Tanzania can pay for the dam itself and that funds will not be sought from China.However, registration logs show large numbers of employees from two state-owned Chinese companies, SinoHydro and Power China, visiting the construction site daily.Already, the Selous is already being radically altered. Loggers, most of them reportedly prisoners, have begun clearing an area of threatened Miombo woodland the size of Surrey to make way for what will be East Africa’s largest artificial reservoir.Elsewhere, quarries are being gouged out and bridges laid to accommodate heavy-duty vehicles.It is only the start. If completed, the nature of the Rufiji would forever change as sandbanks where hippos and crocodiles bask are submerged and its stunning oxbow lakes disappear. Further downstream there would be devastation, too, as the vast Rufiji Delta, one of the continent’s most important wetland sites, shrinks, threatening disaster for East Africa’s largest endangered mangrove forest. Ionides’ vision of an untouched wilderness, and the miracle of regeneration he wrought, is rapidly unravelling. “The Father of the Selous” did not create the reserve a small protected area was carved out by Tanganyika’s German governor in 1896. But, as game warden after Britain took over following the First World War, he increased its boundaries 20-fold. It now encompasses 22,000 square miles.Ruthlessness was involved: the local Ngindo tribesmen who had moved into the area two decades earlier, fleeing Germany’s brutal suppression of the Maji Maji rebellion, were encouraged and eventually forced to move off to reservations where their livestock were safer from lion attack.But Ionides reasoned the land, with its poor soil and plagues of tsetse fly, was only suitable for game. His unyielding desire for solitude, perhaps the result of bullying at Rugby whose latter-day Flashmans could never forgive his Greek origins even though he was a fourth- generation Englishman, also played a part.Whatever the reason, the regeneration of nature was remarkable. Half a century earlier, Joseph Thomson, the Scottish explorer, had not seen a single elephant when he crossed the area: they had all been poached by the Arab slave and ivory traders who plied their wretched trade along the Rufiji’s banks until Britain ended the practice. By Tanzania’s independence in 1961 there were 150,000 of them in the reserve he named after his hero and fellow Old Rugbeian.Selous was killed in the reserve in 1917, the naturalist and big-game hunter who inspired Rider Haggard’s Allan Quatermain meeting his fate at the hands of the Schutztruppe commanded by his nemesis Gen Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. His grave, beneath a tamarind tree in the shadow of the Beho Beho hills a few yards from the still-visible trenches where he fell, is a scene, laced with poignancy and romance, that seems to encapsulate the Selous itself, the spirit of Africa as it once was.In its last great redoubt, that spirit, already tenuous, looks increasingly doomed. Territory elsewhere in the reserve has already been hived off by Rosatom, a state-owned Russian firm to mine uranium. Its work will forever contaminate the soil in an area the elephants still roam. With other riches in the ground too – copper, silver, cobalt, zinc and gold – the vultures of business circling. Should the dam go ahead, further eroding the Selous’ uniqueness, conservationists say it will be harder than ever to keep them at bay.In the meantime, the elephants that had been the reserve’s chief asset are vanishing as the poachers do their bloody work. An aerial survey in 2014 found just 15,000 left in the reserve, a fall of 45,000 in just five years and a 90 per cent decline since Ionides’ day. Though the numbers have stabilised in the last few years, the chances of pulling off an Ionides-style miracle a second time seem slight.Even as Ionides set about his carving out his wilderness, many in the Colonial Office dismissed him as, at best, a flawed visionary creating an untenable dream.Nearly 60 years after his death, with his vision visibly beginning to crumble, the critics seem likely to be proved right.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security  Rise of the sexless marriage as social media brings outside world into privacy of the bedroomPorn should be banned on public transport, say MPs Comment: Could trading relationships between America and the Arab world be the answer to the PalestinianIsraeli standoff? You shouldn\u0026#39t see your doctor in afternoon as they \u0026#39are drained of empathy\u0026#39 after 20 patientsWomen are having lives cut short because GPs miss symptoms of ovarian cancer, study suggests North Korea may make contact with Japan after Abe said he was willing to hold a summit \u0026#39without conditions\u0026#39Trump tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show $1 billion in losses, according to NY TimesCambridge College removes historic bell from view, amid fears it was used on a slave plantationGordonstoun School alumni say outdoor lessons didn\u0026#39t help their prospects Missing piece of Stonehenge found 60 years after excavator stashed it away in his officeUS removes sanctions on Venezuelan intelligence chief after he abandoned MaduroAlcohol consumption has dropped 10 per cent since 90s, with one in four adults turning their back on boozeSeven students wounded in Denver school shooting as police arrest two suspectsThe secret history of the QE2Son threw mother to her death over care home balcony \u0026#39to stop her living in pain\u0026#39Chernobyl, review: Sky\u0026#39s new drama about the power plant explosion is riveting – and utterly horrifyingNicola Sturgeon sets her sights on another six years as First MinisterWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/06/TELEMMGLPICT000196195572_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqplGOf-dgG3z4gg9owgQTXA1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"venezuela accuses bank england blocking food medicine people","story":"Jorge Arreaza, the foreign minister, was speaking following a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey LavrovVenezuela on Monday accused the Bank of England of preventing it from feeding its people and funding public healthcare by blocking access to more than £1 billion in gold deposited by the Maduro regime. During a visit to Moscow, Jorge Arreaza, the Venezuelan foreign minister, sought to blame the recently-imposed US and international sanctions on the Maduro government for the years-long economic and humanitarian crisis that has brought hyperinflation and crippling shortages of food and medicine. In the Bank of England, there are 1359 million euros (£1.16 billion) in Venezuelan gold blocked, Mr Arreaza told a press conference, insisting that this was destined for the health of the people, to feed the people, for production in Venezuela.The Bank of England was among a number of European and international financial institutions that had confiscated 5 billion euros of Venezuela\u0027s money at the behest of Mr Trump, he said. It was this blockade which was to blame for Venezuelan suffering, Mr Arreaza claimed.These are resources of the Venezuelan people for their food, for their health, for their public services, for their housing, for their infrastructure, it\u0027s criminal what the United States is doing, he said. When a housewife can\u0027t get a product or it\u0027s more expensive, it\u0027s thanks to the blockade, When a child can\u0027t be operated on, it\u0027s thanks to the blockade, the foreign minister alleged.Mr Arreaza did not address why these funds had been erted overseas rather than used to met urgent needs at home prior to the sanctions introduced earlier this year. But he said Venezuela was now seeking help from allies such as China and Russia to create alternative routes ... to bypass the American blockade. The Bank of England in January denied Nicolas Maduro\u0027s request to withdraw the gold after the US lobbied for the regime to be cut off from its overseas assets amid the leadership standoff with Juan Guaidó. Mr Guaidó, the National Assembly leader who declared himself the constitutionally legitimate president on January 23, asked for the funds to be erted to him instead, though at present the assets are believed to remain frozen.The US imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela in late January.

The country\u0027s GDP has fallen by around 50 per cent since Mr Maduro took over from the late Hugo Chavez in 2013.In March, Mr Maduro claimed that days-long nationwide blackouts were the result of an electric war waged by the United States, despite previous warnings from electricity workers that the system was on the verge of collapse following years of deterioration and rolling power cuts.Caracas has consistently refused international offers of humanitarian assistance in recent years, even as more than 3.4 million people - more than 10 percent of the population - have fled the country, mostly to other Latin American or nearby Caribbean nations.Mr Maduro\u0027s government has been accused by groups such as Amnesty International of stepping up human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, since the leadership crisis began in January.Rise of the sexless marriage as social media brings outside world into privacy of the bedroomPorn should be banned on public transport, say MPs Comment: Could trading relationships between America and the Arab world be the answer to the PalestinianIsraeli standoff? You shouldn\u0026#39t see your doctor in afternoon as they \u0026#39are drained of empathy\u0026#39 after 20 patientsWomen are having lives cut short because GPs miss symptoms of ovarian cancer, study suggests North Korea may make contact with Japan after Abe said he was willing to hold a summit \u0026#39without conditions\u0026#39Trump tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show $1 billion in losses, according to NY TimesCambridge College removes historic bell from view, amid fears it was used on a slave plantationGordonstoun School alumni say outdoor lessons didn\u0026#39t help their prospects Missing piece of Stonehenge found 60 years after excavator stashed it away in his officeUS removes sanctions on Venezuelan intelligence chief after he abandoned MaduroAlcohol consumption has dropped 10 per cent since 90s, with one in four adults turning their back on boozeSeven students wounded in Denver school shooting as police arrest two suspectsThe secret history of the QE2Son threw mother to her death over care home balcony \u0026#39to stop her living in pain\u0026#39Chernobyl, review: Sky\u0026#39s new drama about the power plant explosion is riveting – and utterly horrifyingNicola Sturgeon sets her sights on another six years as First MinisterWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2018/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000150363861_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth","title":"number foreign nurses coming","story":"There are currently 42,000 nursing vacancies in the NHSThe number of nurses coming to work in the UK from beyond Europe has more than doubled in a year, after watchdogs relaxed the rules on language testing for foreign nurses.New figures show that 6,157 midwives and nurses registered to work in the UK in the last year - a rise from 2,790 the year previously.The Nursing and Midwifery Council said the rise was linked to changes it made to streamline its systems.These included allowing nurses wishing to work in Britain to take their tests in two sittings, if they miss the required standards in their first exam.Since then it has drawn up plans to go futher, lowering the threshold for passing such tests.The new figures show the number of nurses coming from beyond Europe has risen by 126 per cent between March 2018 and March of this year.It followed amendments to the language test requirements, which were annnounced in June 2016.The report also shows a continued drop in the number of nurses coming to work in the UK from countries within the European Union, with a 13 per cent drop in the last two years.Royal College of Nursing chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair said it was “inapppropriate” to rely on a steady stream of nurses from beyond the EU.It follows the leak of a draft workforce strategy, setting out plans for the NHS to launch a global recruitment drive to plug shortages of nurses and doctors.Rise of the sexless marriage as social media brings outside world into privacy of the bedroomComment: Could trading relationships between America and the Arab world be the answer to the PalestinianIsraeli standoff? You shouldn\u0026#39t see your doctor in afternoon as they \u0026#39are drained of empathy\u0026#39 after 20 patientsWomen are having lives cut short because GPs miss symptoms of ovarian cancer, study suggests Porn should be banned on public transport, say MPs North Korea may make contact with Japan after Abe said he was willing to hold a summit \u0026#39without conditions\u0026#39Trump tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show $1 billion in losses, according to NY TimesCambridge College removes historic bell from view, amid fears it was used on a slave plantationMissing piece of Stonehenge found 60 years after excavator stashed it away in his officeGordonstoun School alumni say outdoor lessons didn\u0026#39t help their prospects US removes sanctions on Venezuelan intelligence chief after he abandoned MaduroAlcohol consumption has dropped 10 per cent since 90s, with one in four adults turning their back on boozeSeven students wounded in Denver school shooting as police arrest two suspectsThe secret history of the QE2Son threw mother to her death over care home balcony \u0026#39to stop her living in pain\u0026#39Chernobyl, review: Sky\u0026#39s new drama about the power plant explosion is riveting – and utterly horrifyingNicola Sturgeon sets her sights on another six years as First MinisterComment: Our entire political system is based on confrontation.

Earlier this week the High Pay Centre attacked big shareholders for failing to act on excessive boardroom payClick to followThe IndependentBritish Gas owner Centrica is at the centre of a row over boss Iain Conn\u0027s payIs Centrica’s annual meeting going to provide another example of the failure of big institutional investors to act on excessive pay?The owner of British Gas is coming off a thoroughly miserable year. It angered consumers by imposing price increases, issued a profit warning, and announced thousands of job cuts. The performance of the shares, meanwhile, was miserable.\u0026nbspDespite all this, CEO Iain Conn saw his overall packaging rising to £2.4m from £1.7m thanks to bonuses, including an annual award and a payout from the long term incentive plan the company gave him.\u0026nbspBritish Gas owner’s stock falls to 20-year low after warning on profitBritish Gas owner Centrica will cut 1,000 jobs this yearNeedless to say, the rise has come in for considerable criticism. The latest to take a shot at it is Pirc, the voting adviser, which has urged shareholders to vote down the remuneration report at the forthcoming AGM.“The change in CEO total pay over five years is not commensurate with the change in TSR (total shareholder return) over the same period. Awards granted during the year under review were excessive at 250 per cent of salary,” it said in a report.\u0026nbspJust so. Quite how such a package can be seen as in any way in shareholders’ interests when shareholders\u0027 interests\u0026nbspin the company have so obviously been declining in value is beyond me.Pirc’s intervention is worth of note because it comes just a day after the High Pay Commission\u0026nbspsharply criticised Britain’s institutional investors for failing to curb excessive executive pay.\u0026nbspIt took a look at the rules that gave shareholders a veto on companies’ pay policy but failed to find an incidence of them actually using their power at a\u0026nbspFTSE 100 company.\u0026nbspOf 700 pay related resolutions in total, only 11 per cent attracted “significant” levels of dissent among 20 per cent or more of shareholders. Meanwhile, the median (most common) level of CEO pay in the FTSE reached £3.9m in 2017, 137 times that of the typical UK worker.

The catch is that the customer has to pay the fee regardless of whether their property is sold or not.\u0026nbspThe model has nonetheless rapidly gained traction in the UK, and the company’s successful marketing\u0026nbsprecently got it named on one of those “super brand” lists people like to put out.\u0026nbspLondon house prices fall at fastest pace since 2009Purplebricks founder and CEO Michael Bruce resignsPurplebricks to put its own house up for saleBut there’s nothing super about the way it has performed as an investment. Purplebricks joined the stock market at a quid in 2015 and backers\u0026nbspwere richly rewarded in the early days. The stock was touching a fiver within 18 months as investors got stars in their eyes over the plans by Bruce and his team to take the brand global.\u0026nbspBut the shares hit a bump in the road when stockbroker Jeffries last year issued a sharply critical research note, questioning the company’s sales success rates, and describing selling with it as “a £1,000 coin toss”, a reference to the fees which top that in London post codes.\u0026nbspThe broker argued the model hadn’t been sufficiently tested and claimed that the shares were priced for “perfection”.\u0026nbspThe latter part of that has proved prescient given the less than perfect performance the company has put in. Chairman Paul Pindar issued what can only be described as a grovelling apology to its investors in the latest update.\u0026nbsp“We are very conscious that the group’s performance has been disappointing over the last 12 months and we sincerely apologise to shareholders for that,” he said.\u0026nbspHowever, Purplebricks denies that there is any problem with the model per se.\u0026nbspPindar rather put the blame for the company’s issues on trying to go global too fast and making some bad investments, or, as he put it, “we have also made sub-optimal decisions in allocating capital”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

On the table was a bottle of wine. When they ordered a second, there was an audible ripple of admiration around the room. Fellow diners smiled in their direction.\u0026nbspThis scene unfolded recently in a City restaurant. Indeed, the two men looked as if they had met for a bit of a stockbroker reunion, to reminisce about their share trading, and lunching, days.\u0026nbspHardly anyone has a “two bottler” any more. Not at lunch on a work day. One bottle is rare, but a couple –\u0026nbspthat is going some.\u0026nbspEven a glass of wine is relatively scarce. If I look through my diary of a month’s worth of business lunches, those where the other person had a glass (like many, I no longer drink at lunchtime) amount to just a handful.\u0026nbspIn most workplaces today, drinking during working hours is frowned upon, as is consuming enough alcohol in the evening so that your breath smells of it the following morning. Doing the latter once may be okay\u0026nbspdo it twice or more, and you will be marked down as having “a problem”.\u0026nbspLloyd’s of London bans drink and drugs in the workplaceTimes have changed enormously since I started out, first in the City, then in media. Back then, and we’re talking more than three decades ago, it was standard to head to the nearest wine bar or the pub, and polish off a few glasses of wine or pints of beer before returning to your desk and attempting to work.\u0026nbspSometimes, as a junior, you felt obliged to keep your end up, so when the partners at my law firm, all male, lined up another bottle I would gulp and go along with it. Likewise, as a journalist, you occasionally had to go with the flow\u0026nbspas part of the job.\u0026nbspOne of the booziest lunches I ever had was with Crispin Odey, the hedge fund magnate. When I arrived to interview him at Corrigan’s –\u0026nbspthe super-smart Mayfair restaurant of star chef Richard Corrigan –\u0026nbspI was treated like royalty. Odey was running slightly late, and I was shown to a prime table. The staff bustled around, checking I was okay\u0026nbspnothing was too much for them. Finally\u0026nbsphe arrived, and they went into overdrive.A bottle of normally exquisite –\u0026nbspand expensive –\u0026nbspwhite Burgundy was produced, which Odey decided was not quite right. The sommelier scurried away to fetch another one. Odey glanced at the menu and knew what he wanted: a duck egg to start, followed by, if I agreed, a shared steak and kidney pie. “And what about some beef on the side, let’s have the loin of beef on the side. Lovely. Oh, and we’d better have some mash and some kale –\u0026nbspwe ought to have something green.”He called over the wine waiter again: “And we’d like a bottle of the Leoville.” The Leoville Barton was superb, as was the food. This was mid-week. A bottle of white, and a bottle of red. Beef on the side. Even back then, nobody had lunch like this, not any more, not in oh-so politically correct, watching-the-calories, London. Not on this scale, and even more rarely, at this cost. What’s more, with Odey, there was the feeling this was nothing special. The office of his firm, Odey Asset Management, was across the road, and Corrigan’s might as well have been his canteen.As the lunch progressed, my handwriting became illegible, and started to angle down the page,\u0026nbspuntil the words trailed off completelySo, when I read an interview this week with veteran advertising boss Rory Sutherland, I was drawn to his statement that his industry is inordinately less boozy than it was: “Mind you, everything is less boozy. It was pretty routine at lunchtime to see people in the street outside a pub at 2.30 necking pints. It was also routine in advertising, which I always thought was a good thing which we shouldn’t have lost.”Sutherland was reminiscing in the same month that Lloyd’s of London has issued a new stern code of conduct to the 40,000 pass holders at its Leadenhall Street headquarters. From now on, anyone thought to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be refused entry. This, from what was regarded for its 331 year existence as the high temple of lunchtime boozing.\u0026nbspWho is right, who is wrong? Lloyd’s move was motivated by claims of sexual harassment and bad, laddish behaviour. It effectively signals the end for what was known euphemistically in the City as “liquid negotiations” or what Brexiteer Nigel Farage, a former broker, refers to as PFLs\u0026nbsp– “proper f***ing lunches”.\u0026nbspLike Nigel, I enjoyed my PFLs. Like Rory, too, I look back at them with fondness.\u0026nbspBut I also have to ask myself:\u0026nbspapart from spending what, over the years, would have amounted to a considerable sum of money, piling on the calories, and making me feel terrible the rest of the day, what did they actually achieve? Of course, they fostered camaraderie, of the loud, male, kind.\u0026nbspI also\u0026nbspsaw, though, far too many careers and lives ruined by what began as the odd PFL turning into a daily occurrence. A liquid lunch would then be replicated by something similar in the evening, every evening. One of\u0026nbsp those, doubtless, was Guy Farage, a City trader and alcoholic\u0026nbspwho abandoned the family home and his son, Nigel, then aged five.\u0026nbspDid any good come from them? I would venture, not where progress at work was concerned. I attempted to fire questions at Odey. As the lunch progressed, my handwriting became illegible\u0026nbspand started to angle down the page, until the words trailed off completely. I had to finish the interview when I was sober.\u0026nbspLloyd’s initiative is long overdue. We may miss the lunchtime drinking. But if we’re honest, not really.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But thanks to\u0026nbspColston, who started localised growing programmes in 2018, her descendants have survived. Her great-great-great-great granddaughter is sitting at a table made from oak grown from an acorn Colston planted, and harvested at a a sawmill established under Colston’s watch, which has brought business back to the valley. “Thank you for making change happen and thank you for our future,” the descendant writes.\u0026nbspGovernment set to ‘miss public land housebuilding target by 95,000’NHS hospital in England refusing to accept patients from WalesScottish Government plans to tackle land ownership inequalityIt’s Wednesday lunchtime in an empty shopping unit in the Capitol Centre, Cardiff, and Colston is one of of a handful of residents presenting their vision for the future of the Welsh valleys. Nearly 100 people are gathered, including Welsh assembly members, local councillors, forestry authorities and community groups. The Skyline Project has\u0026nbspspent nine months engaging\u0026nbspartists to unlock residents’\u0026nbspideas about their natural environment. The resulting maps and quotations are pasted all over the gallery walls, including dreams of swimming pools, walking routes, honeybees and wild birds.Colston’s postcard might be fantasy today, but Skyline\u0026nbspsees this artistic reimagining as the first step to a community action plan for the land.One man is here to show them what’s possible. Alastair McIntosh was one of four founders of the Isle of Eigg Trust in 1991, which in the space of six years wrested the island in the Scottish Hebrides from rich owners and put it in the hands of the community. “It’s not about sloganising politics, it’s about figuring out things that are going to work,” he says. “You have to start digging with a teaspoon, then a spade, then a digger, and then political confidence to flow into those channels.”But Scotland has a very different tradition of land ownership. As well as positive examples of community ownership, Scotland has a history of crofting, or long term leases of private land to stewards, and momentum is growing for further reform. An investigation by the Scottish Land Commission found that concentrated land ownership in Scotland, where 1,125 people own 70 per cent of the land, has held back prospects for economic, housing and community development. The commission went so far as to describe the concentration of land ownership in Scotland as “socially corrosive”.The situation in Wales is different. Wales has fewer private landowners. It also has much more public land. The question for the groups involved in Skyline is whether they can get public bodies to support their ideas. “Being able to get land is a political thing,” says Mark Walton, the co-director of Shared Assets. “In Scotland it required legislation. What’s exciting is that Skyline is looking at what is already publicly owned land. It is in the gift of authorities to transfer ownership to communities or give them leases to allow the to manage productively. That’s a massive opportunity because it overcomes the main barrier to entry, which is the cost of buying the land.”Walton says that an ambitious programme of land transfer to communities in urban areas has the potential to revitalise areas still reeling from the death of traditional industry, particularly in Wales and the north of England. But he acknowledges that is it sometimes difficult for authorities to cede power: “Authorities are afraid because this fundamentally changes the relationship between the state and the people. It changes the way the civil servants behave. It changes the dynamic – and that is scary.”Ian Thomas, runs Welcome to Our Woods, a community partnership in the upper Rhondda Fawr making local natural resources accessible to residents. In May, Welcome to Our Woods was awarded £90,000 in grants and loans from the Co-op Foundation, to put towards its project converting waste wood into furniture and biomass fuel, generating income. The money has been generated by the sale of 5p bags in the Co-op’s Welsh supermarkets.In October, Thomas, Colston and other volunteers from other valleys groups visited the Kilfinan Community Forest in Tighnabruaich, which manages ownership of 434 hectares of Acharossan Forest. Chris Blake, who started the Skyline Project, says that the trip proved the possibilities. “To see for yourselves what the forest crofts has achieved in eight years was quite staggering,” he says. “At the end of the day we sat down and suddenly we realised it can be done.”Geraint Davies, the Plaid Cymru councillor for Treherbert ward, is among those at the event in the shopping centre. As visitors browse\u0026nbspthe exhibition, he remembers playing in the mountains as a child:\u0026nbsp“We used to be up there making dams, but you don’t see children up there now.”Would he support community ownership of the land? “I think that would be wonderful,” he says. “It’s very important to get people committed to the area through ownership. In the past people have come in, done things, and gone again.”Lee Waters, the deputy minister for economy and transport at the Welsh assembly, sees Skyline as part of a broader movement for the democratic ownership of land and the economy that is going on in places like Preston in Lancashire and Barcelona in Spain.How South Wales is learning from community forests in Scotland“There has been a profound change going on in the valleys in just two generations. There’s been considerable depopulation\u0026nbspand some areas are returning to semi-rural, which creates a range of policy challenges but also opens up a new way of doing things,” Waters says. “Might the Welsh government give Skyline funding for land? There’s absolutely no reason why we wouldn’t. We’d have to see some detail but I think it’s got huge potential.”Thomas says the seeds of change have already been planted. “When we looked at our land we found that 85 per cent is public estate,” he says. “So we’re not talking about ownership because as far as we’re concerned we already own the land. It’s about what level of stewardship we get. What we are looking at is a micro-hydro scheme, a sawmill, solar farms and forest crofts. This land is opportunity for us.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will learn from these errors and will not make them again.”Purplebricks bemoaned “increasingly challenging” conditions in Australia and confessed to “execution errors”, adding that returns from the nation are “not sufficient to justify continued investment”.It will now commence an “orderly run down” with immediate effect, pending closure.In the US, Purplebricks has put its operations under review.Brexit a major drag on UK housing market as demand slumpsAsking prices slashed by £26,000 as UK housing market slows downThe firm said: “Whilst good progress has been made in launching our brand across the US, the board has materially cut investment in marketing and other overheads to reduce expenditure to sustainable levels and begun a strategic review.”In February, Purplebricks warned over headwinds in the Australian housing market when it admitted that it does not expect to meet revenue forecasts for the year.In the US, the company cautioned that there has been a “slower-than-expected response” to its marketing initiative and it also does not expect US revenue to meet expectations.To compound matters, last month analysts downgraded the online estate agent and said it would have to raise fresh cash.Berenberg warned in a research note that the group should either give up on its international expansion plans or raise more funding as it slashed its rating from buy to sell.It cited a slowdown in Purplebricks’ core UK market, as well as tough conditions in Australia and the US.Purplebricks confirmed that it expects revenue to be within the £130m to £140m range it guided for in February and cash balances will be no lower than £62m.Shares in Purplebricks shed over 5 per cent\u0026nbspin morning trade to 127p.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, said: “The UK housing market has softened, prices are falling in Australia and cracking the US is proving very difficult.“It’s tried to expand a little bit too quickly, but clearly the market conditions in the UK and Australia have been less than favourable.“In fact, it’s got so bad in Australia that the company is pulling out. In the US it looks like it will materially scale back the business. Canada is better, but small. The focus will now be on Canada, where growth is good, and shoring up the core domestic market in the UK.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our expectation is that all brands we work with are aware of and actively engaging with the issues surrounding palm oil and deforestation.”Consumers have become increasingly aware\u0026nbspof the devastation linked to palm oil, prompting\u0026nbspretailers to seek to reduce their usage of the commodity, but so far progress has been limited.Last year, Iceland attracted attention by becoming the first UK supermarket to commit to removing\u0026nbsppalm oil from all of its own-brand lines.Iceland accused of still using palm oil – despite promising to stopIceland said it would achieve its goal by the end of 2018 but in January it emerged that 28 own-brand products containing palm oil were still on sale and the company had removed its label form 17 other lines.Around 600 branded products containing palm oil were still available at Iceland, the BBC found.Nestle, the world’s biggest food manufacturer, attracted firm criticism from environmental groups over claims made last week that 77 per cent of the commodities used in its products were deforestation-free.Richard George, Head of Forests at Greenpeace UK said the claim “wholly contradicts” very recent discussions that Greenpeace had with Nestle.“We know Nestle continues to trade with some of the world’s guiltiest suppliers when it comes to deforestation for palm oil, soya and cocoa,” Mr George said.“Without further explanation, we can only conclude that this is a blatant and embarrassing attempt by the company to deceive its customers and absolve all responsibility for its contribution to the destruction of the world’s forests.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here\u0027s exactly what has changed, what stayed the same, what the specs are – and how much it will actually cost.The new phones\u0027 key selling point – and the main thing that sets it apart from the Pixel 3\u0026nbsp– is the price.\u0026nbspThe 3a starts at £399 and the 3a XL starts at £469. That\u0027s nearly half the price of their bigger siblings: the 3 starts at £739 and the 3 XL costs at least £869.Those same price differences will be reflected across different markets and on pay monthly plans, too.The phone is available to buy immediately, and is being sold in the UK by Google itself as well as other retailers including EE and Argos.The first thing to mention is that there\u0027s nothing new in the Pixel 3a that wasn\u0027t there in the Pixel 3. The only extra thing it has is the return of the headphone jack, which disappeared on the Pixel 3.So the only real advantage the new phone has over the old one is the price – though that of course is fairly significant.There are some features slashed from the Pixel 3 to get to that cheaper price, and some specs have been downgraded.\u0026nbspIn full, they are: a slightly slower processor, the removal of the selfie cam that allows you to zoom out extra wide and get everyone into a picture, the lack of wireless charging, slightly less high-powered speakers, and no water resistance.The screen sizes are also slightly different. The display on the 3a XL is smaller than its more premium counterpart at 6-inches\u0026nbsp– and is a slightly\u0026nbsplower definition –\u0026nbspand the display on the standard 3a is a little bigger than the Pixel 3 at 5.6-inches.You also miss out on the option to upgrade your storage. The Pixel 3 range allows people to buy up to 128GB of space – but the 3a is stuck at 64GB.Everything else – from the display to the memory – is unchanged.Even the external design is so similar that you can only spot it from the minor tweaks on the outside, like the added headphone jack and the lack of lens for the selfie camera.For your (reduced) money, you get a whole host of decent if downgraded specs. The screens are both FHD+ OLED\u0026nbspdisplays, the phones have Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 processors, they have 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. On the back is a\u0026nbsp12 megapixel dual-pixel camera, just like on the Pixel 3.As well as all of the specs, Google has promised that the 3a and 3a XL will receive three years of security and operating system upgrades. That\u0027s intended as a way of stressing that this phone won\u0027t be left out in the cold despite its cheaper price and the fact that its processors could become too slow for new updates more quickly.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the UK a standard drink is 8g of pure alcohol. A measure of 5.9 litres is equivalent to one-and-a-half UK standard drinks per day.More than one in seven (15 per cent) people in the UK abstained from alcohol in 2017, three in four (77 per cent) had alcohol, and more than one in four (26 per cent) were\u0026nbspbinge drinking\u0026nbspat least once a month.Karen Tyrell, of drug and alcohol charity Addaction, warned: “In the UK, four out of five people with an alcohol problem aren’t getting any sort of treatment. We need to make it a lot easier to get help and support at a much earlier stage.“Alcohol is soaked through our culture. The alcohol industry has set the terms of the debate for too long. Flashy marketing disguises an industry that doesn’t do nearly enough to compensate for the harm it causes. We know that 4 per cent of drinkers consume one-third of the alcohol sold.”He added: “Helping people make healthier choices is vital but all the evidence shows we need a better policy if we are serious about change.”Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But does everyone have what it takes to get a book deal?\u0026nbspBesides a great idea, you arguably need\u0026nbsptalent, time and dedication to tip yourself over the line from aspiring writer to published author. In 2019, you may also need a social media following.\u0026nbspTake Pinch of Nom, a cookbook by Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson, which sold more than 210,000 copies in three days.Pinch of Nom was the UK’s most read cooking blog. Another major factor contributing to the duo’s potential was their strong Facebook group following of more than 800,000 people, a very engaged and responsive community which shared recipes and slimming tips, not counting the 1.4 million people who like their public Facebook page. These numbers are all the more impressive given the authors didn’t launch the Facebook group until 2016.The arguable starting point for social media-fuelled book deals started with YouTube. A few years ago, many of the popular vloggers won deals. Zoella, aka Zoe Sugg, published her first novel at age 24 with Penguin in 2014. Her first week sales numbers outstripped Harry Potter and Fifty Shades of Grey (Sugg later admitted the book was ghost written). But by 2017, publishers were complaining the YouTube market was saturated, and were sometimes seeing disappointing UK e-book sales and waning interest from certain foreign markets.Anna Steadman, a senior commissioning editor at a publisher called Headline, described this phenomenon as the “YouTube gold rush”. She added that publishers now take a more nuanced view of the different social media platforms and how that might affect book sales.\u0026nbsp“People can have 250,000 followers on Instagram, for example, but that doesn’t always translate into sales,” she said. “Instagram can be quite a passive medium, where people are mainly looking at pictures, while a smaller Twitter or Facebook following, for example, can sometimes be more engaged.”Created with Sketch.Social media influencers who got book deals Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pinch of Nom by Kay Featherstone and Kate AllinsonGirl Online by Zoella The Unmumsy Mum by Sarah TurnerWhy Mummy Drinks by Gill SimsMan vs Toddler by Matt CoynePinch of Nom by Kay Featherstone and Kate AllinsonGirl Online by Zoella The Unmumsy Mum by Sarah TurnerWhy Mummy Drinks by Gill SimsMan vs Toddler by Matt CoyneAfter the YouTube books came the so-called mummy bloggers. Those that sold very well all had strong followings on Facebook. The Unmumsy Mum, by Sarah Turner, was published last year, five years after Turner started her blog and gathering 650,000 Facebook followers in the meantime. Why Mummy Drinks, by Gill Sims, was published in 2017 and also followed on from a blog. Sims currently has 407,000 Facebook followers. Man vs. Toddler: The Trials and Triumphs of Toddlerdom, by Matt Coyne, also started off as a blog and he now has 241,000 fans on the social media platform.‘Ask children about impact of social media’, psychiatrists toldIn an age where people can buy Twitter followers, and where Facebook is accused of artificially inflating video viewing figures, publishers are less likely to take big numbers at face value. As Steadman explained, they look for quality over quantity – good news for those of us who could never hope to replicate Pinch of Nom’s Facebook success.Nonetheless, social media numbers do still come into it. Alex Holder, who has just published her debut non-fiction book, Open Up: The Power of Talking About Money, said at least one editor rejected her proposal due to her social media. She has more than 4,000 Twitter followers.Holder ended up getting a deal with Serpent’s Tail. There is very little transparency around how much authors are paid, so trying to determine whether authors get offered more if they have a large social media following is almost impossible. Holder is one of the few authors to reveal the advance for her debut (£12,500) and she wrote an article arguing that more people should reveal their advances to increase transparency in the industry. However, she said she understands some publishers’ initial hesitation when it comes to judging a person’s social media following.Sometimes, all publishers say ‘no thanks’ and the author in question has to take a different tact.\u0026nbspAlice-May Purkiss, author of Life, Lemons and Melons, her memoir about battling breast cancer, said that despite her “incredible agent” and the excitement from publishers, her social media following was cited as the reason to not give her a deal.Bestsellers on AmazonPinch of Nom: 100 Slimming Home-Style Recipes by Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson (813,000 Facebook group members)Hinch Yourself Happy: All The Best Cleaning Tips To Shine Your Sink And Soothe Your Soul by Mrs Hinch (126,000 Facebook group members)5 Ingredients – Quick \u0026amp Easy Food, by Jamie Oliver (6.9m Facebook page followers)Mary Berry’s Quick Cooking, by Mary Berry (366,000 Facebook page followers)This Is Going To Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor, by Adam Kay (67,000\u0026nbspTwitter followers)“I had around 3,000 followers across the platforms, which I totally accept is small but I guess I hoped that the idea and my writing would be enough to carry the project,” she said.\u0026nbspThat was two years ago. Since then she decided to self-publish, creating a Kickstarted campaign. She raised £5,000 for the first print run and donated 10 per cent\u0026nbspof the proceeds to charity.Part of the reason publishers and agents get excited about social media is the way they can generate pre-sales, before the book is printed. If an author can generate enough pre-sales themselves, even without social media, a publisher may then offer a contract.Another hot trend in the non-fiction category millennial memoirs, with recent and upcoming books from many well-known journalists and writers with social media followings, including Joel Golby, Bryony Gordon, Daisy Buchanan and Hannah Witton, who has her own YouTube channel. The memoir trend arguably reached new heights after the publication last year of Dolly Alderton’s memoir and Sunday Times best-seller, Everything I Know About Love.Anna Steadman was part of the team that bought Alderton’s memoir at Fig Tree (Penguin) before she moved to Headline. Speaking generally about memoirs, Steadman said: “Unless you have a genuinely incredible story, and even if you do,, it helps to have a fanbase who wants to read your story – it could be a newspaper column or a Facebook page but if no one has heard of you then of course it will be harder to sell your book.”Steadman added that publishers are always looking to break an author out beyond their fanbase, however large, because they want to publish work that will resonate with existing fans as well as people who might not have come across that writer before. Essentially, throwing the net as wide as possible.Social media firms to be legally forced to protect usersObama urges young people to fight ‘negative politics’ of social mediaSurge in prisoners’ social media accounts being closed downBut what about fiction?\u0026nbspAnna Davis is a literary agent at Curtis Brown and director of the Curtis Brown Creative writing school. Since inception in 2011, the writing courses have seen 63 of their alumni secure book deals for their first novel, either via working with Curtis Brown or with other agents.\u0026nbsp“I’m not aware of any situations in fiction where someone has been turned down for not having a social media following,” Davis insisted. “I don’t believe it, in fact. Most important is the book, and anything else is an extra.”Davis added: “There will always be writers not taken on by agents and publishers. Sometimes they want to point the finger at something specific, like the writer’s social media following, but I doubt that’s the real reason in all but a few places.”In fiction, some authors do not engage online at all, or some write under pseudonyms, like Elena Ferrante. But even Ferrante engages in traditional publicity, for example giving interviews. Many people in the publishing industry look at the top 100 best-selling lists on Amazon, which are updated every hour: the rankings can change as soon as an author appears on a radio show or has an article published, for example.Many novelists that The Independent spoke to agreed that social media was less important when it came to securing a deal in fiction, compared to other categories.“It’s all about the book,” said Fiona Mitchell, who has a two-book deal with Hodder. “Social media helps, probably, but it’s not essential to land a deal. Besides, there’s such a long lead in from getting signed to publication that you can build social media in that time.”Social media helps, probably, but it’s not essential to land a deal.\u0026nbsp There’s such a long lead in from getting signed to publication that you can build social media in that timeThere can be many months, if not years, between birthing an idea for a book and publication day. In the run up to publication, authors are encouraged to share their contacts of people who might be willing to review or read their proofs, as well as engage in social media – although this advice is not usually part of a contract with a publisher.“If you don’t have a big budget assigned to you, as is the case with most authors, you meet your publicist, discuss personal contacts, who to send proofs to, and who could maybe review the book or do a reading,” said Davis. “A great address book has always been a boon. But now with social media you’ll see your publicist and they will say, ‘You have 50,000 followers – what can we do with that?’”Twitter is a useful platform to engage with other writers, too. Crime writers, for example, are known for being supportive and generous towards each other’s work.One of those crime authors is Erin Kelly, who says all the crime writers she knows now she met on Twitter. Those conversations, she said, migrated to Facebook and then became real life friendships. Kelly was signed 10 years ago, before social media became mainstream. Now she regularly posts on Twitter, but said it was a gradual process.Bestsellers on AmazonMy Lovely Wife, by Samantha Downing (1,938 Twitter followers)The Rumour, by Lesley Kara (1,191 Twitter followers)No Way Out, by Cara Hunter (3,593 Twitter followers)The World Walker, by Ian W Sainsbury (748 Facebook followers and just 229 Twitter followers)“Marketing departments will walk you through it, if you’re new to social media,” she said. “They will show you who to follow or emulate, and how to do it.”She insists that her books and social media channels are two separate brands.\u0026nbsp“My Twitter is funny and light and I avoid politics – politics make my blood pressure scoot off the scale. Instead, I share books I’m reading and talk about culture and music,” she said. “I find that doing that is the way forward. But there’s no graph to show whether that leads to book sales. I imagine it’s more a gentle encouragement.”Kelly added that being present on social media should not be all about self-promotion, as people will switch off.\u0026nbsp“I would always encourage an author to talk about their book in context, instead of saying ‘buy my book, buy my book’,” she said. “I always follow people I’m genuinely interested in and I don’t do strategic follows.”The irony is that building up and engaging with your following can take you away from your writing – the most important part of the whole process. For example, Kelly said she bought an app called Freedom for about £30 so she can get her writing done – currently she has a rate of a new book every year.“Some authors become so anxious developing a following it becomes counterproductive,” advised Davis. “And if an author is really uncomfortable going on social media, I would tell them not to do it.\u0027\u0027Pinch of NomOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will learn from these errors and will not make them again.”Purplebricks bemoaned “increasingly challenging” conditions in Australia and confessed to “execution errors”, adding that returns from the nation are “not sufficient to justify continued investment”.It will now commence an “orderly run down” with immediate effect, pending closure.In the US, Purplebricks has put its operations under review.Brexit a major drag on UK housing market as demand slumpsAsking prices slashed by £26,000 as UK housing market slows downThe firm said: “Whilst good progress has been made in launching our brand across the US, the board has materially cut investment in marketing and other overheads to reduce expenditure to sustainable levels and begun a strategic review.”In February, Purplebricks warned over headwinds in the Australian housing market when it admitted that it does not expect to meet revenue forecasts for the year.In the US, the company cautioned that there has been a “slower-than-expected response” to its marketing initiative and it also does not expect US revenue to meet expectations.To compound matters, last month analysts downgraded the online estate agent and said it would have to raise fresh cash.Berenberg warned in a research note that the group should either give up on its international expansion plans or raise more funding as it slashed its rating from buy to sell.It cited a slowdown in Purplebricks’ core UK market, as well as tough conditions in Australia and the US.Purplebricks confirmed that it expects revenue to be within the £130m to £140m range it guided for in February and cash balances will be no lower than £62m.Shares in Purplebricks shed over 5 per cent\u0026nbspin morning trade to 127p.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, said: “The UK housing market has softened, prices are falling in Australia and cracking the US is proving very difficult.“It’s tried to expand a little bit too quickly, but clearly the market conditions in the UK and Australia have been less than favourable.“In fact, it’s got so bad in Australia that the company is pulling out. In the US it looks like it will materially scale back the business. Canada is better, but small. The focus will now be on Canada, where growth is good, and shoring up the core domestic market in the UK.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our expectation is that all brands we work with are aware of and actively engaging with the issues surrounding palm oil and deforestation.”Consumers have become increasingly aware\u0026nbspof the devastation linked to palm oil, prompting\u0026nbspretailers to seek to reduce their usage of the commodity, but so far progress has been limited.Last year, Iceland attracted attention by becoming the first UK supermarket to commit to removing\u0026nbsppalm oil from all of its own-brand lines.Iceland accused of still using palm oil – despite promising to stopIceland said it would achieve its goal by the end of 2018 but in January it emerged that 28 own-brand products containing palm oil were still on sale and the company had removed its label form 17 other lines.Around 600 branded products containing palm oil were still available at Iceland, the BBC found.Nestle, the world’s biggest food manufacturer, attracted firm criticism from environmental groups over claims made last week that 77 per cent of the commodities used in its products were deforestation-free.Richard George, Head of Forests at Greenpeace UK said the claim “wholly contradicts” very recent discussions that Greenpeace had with Nestle.“We know Nestle continues to trade with some of the world’s guiltiest suppliers when it comes to deforestation for palm oil, soya and cocoa,” Mr George said.“Without further explanation, we can only conclude that this is a blatant and embarrassing attempt by the company to deceive its customers and absolve all responsibility for its contribution to the destruction of the world’s forests.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To avoid further costs, the withdrawal agreement bill will need to be put before MPs within a week or so – but that will not happen without a Labour agreement not to vote it down.At the weekend, the acrimony was laid bare when John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and other Labour figures accused Ms May of refusing to budge on the party’s central demand for a permanent customs union.How the MPs’ expenses scandal paved the way for BrexitJuncker says mistake for EU to stay silent during Brexit referendumMay faces renewed Tory pressure to quit over Brexit handlingHow to register to vote for the European electionsCorbyn should back a second referendum – but with a crucial conditionHeading into the talks, Sir Keir, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “The time has now come to a crunch time, where the government has to decide whether it’s serious about significant changes capable of actually carrying a majority in the House of Commons.”He pointed significantly to the clamour over a further referendum, adding: “A confirmatory vote will also be on the agenda, and we’re going to discuss that this afternoon.”No 10 has refused to provide “a checklist” of her continued red lines in the talks, but her own MPs made clear the referendum issue could no longer be dodged.“If there can be no compromise between the parties, I can actually see then the logic, and other people will be demanding another referendum,” Mr Kawczynski added.Mr Vaizey, a former minister, said: “I\u0027ve always been against a second referendum. But I think what is changing my mind is this talk about any agreement reached by parliament being seen as illegitimate.”Any cross-party deal would pass only narrowly, which means MPs would “spend their whole time telling the public that this isn\u0027t Brexit, it’s not the Brexit they voted for – it\u0027s illegitimate”.\u0026nbspEarlier, the prime minister met Graham Brady, the head of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, who was expected to again urge her to set a rapid timetable for her departure.If she refuses, the 1922 will consider rewriting the rules to allow a fresh vote of no confidence this summer – but Sir Graham made no immediate comment on Ms May’s response.\u0026nbspAsked about the EU elections, the prime minister’s spokesman said she “deeply regrets” the fact the UK would be taking part, admitting: “Many members of the public will feel great frustration at this.”The spokesman declined to say whether Ms May thought people should vote in the elections – or whether she would take part in any election campaign launch by the Conservatives.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think she will make a great mum."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT0004872046461.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may corbyn brexit compromise","story":"Theresa May is days away from unveiling a soft Brexit compromise, cobbled together in desperation with an equally battered Jeremy Corbyn, which risks infuriating voters even more.It doesn’t matter what they call it, this will be a customs union in all but name.Such an arrangement will block Britain from striking its own lucrative trade deals after quitting the EU, leaving us shackled to Brussels for years.If this climbdown is not enough, weak-willed Mrs May also appears to have bowed to Labour’s wish to keep us tied to EU rules on workers’ rights.The PM seems willing to cave in to all the Labour leader’s demands, just as she did with Brussels Eurocrats.Eventhis diluted deal does gain Parliamentary and EU backing, there is barely enough time to prevent the £million European elections on May .So millions of fed-up and furious voters will deliver an even more devastating verdict at the ballot box.After Thursday’s vote it’s clear people don’t want the wool pulled over their eyes on Brexit. They want a clean break.Ignoring them will be politically fatal.A FOREIGN holiday is a well-deserved break for many hard-working families.So it beggars belief that Labour is considering slapping a new tax on Brits who diligently save up their cash so they can fly abroad more than once a year.Under a frequent flyer levy, anyone will be penalised when they land back in Britain for the second time. The amount would rise for subsequent journeys.Labour eco-zealots said the plans were aimed at the rich.But millions of ordinary families will find the cost of their holidays rising yet again.Jeremy Corbyn and his Marxist rabble plan to use every aspect of our lives to fleece us.THE police have announced that Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson didn’t commit a crime by allegedly leaking information about the Chinese tech giant Huawei.In fact, they said, he didn’t break Britain’s Official Secrets Act, didn’t commit an act of misconduct in public office and it wasn’t a police matter at all.Anyone might think he was fired on Wednesday to ert attention from Mrs May’s Brexit deal with Labour on the eve of the local elections.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s their antics that have cost us tonight.”He was just one of several leading Labour councillors who spoke in similarly scathing terms about the damage done by their party’s Brexit shenanigans.And it affects the Conservative Party just as much — , lost council seats can be seen no other way.Anybody who has knocked on a door in the last few weeks knows this is how the country feels and realises the danger our democratic system facesthis lack of trust is not addressed.The public holds both major parties responsible.Unfortunately, it has reached the stage now where one fears the worst and wonders what next pitfall awaits.There are at least two imminent bear traps.The first is a pact with the devil, whereby the Prime Minister does a deal with Jeremy Corbyn simply to wish the problem of Brexit away.Of course, it won’t work. If the UK remains in the Customs Union, it will be a betrayal of Brexit.It will lead to a path that leads to remaining in the single market and subjection to EU law, and it will stop the UK making trade deals with the rest of the world.What a pathetic state of affairs. Essentially agreeing anything, just anything, so long as we no longer have to talk about Brexit. Of course, this would be disastrous. Corbyn is a neo-Marxist.The public do not trust him. This is another clear message from these local elections. Why do deals with somebody so discredited  The very idea filled Conservative councillors, and not a few Tory voters, with fury during this campaign.The second trap would be carrying on regardless.Stick with the Prime Minister’s thrice-rejected deal and claim “there is no alternative”.This seems to be the default position on this Government since last summer.This path will lead to more disagreement, more misery and a hammering in the European Elections the like of which no governing party has ever seen.The Government’s proposed Withdrawal Agreement is deeply flawed.How many times have they been told this  It subjects the UK to EU law-making and hands over £billion for very little in .It was only able to be made tolerablethe Northern Ireland backstop was scrapped or time limited. This is why the House of Commons passed the Brady Amendment.Notably it was literally the only thing the House could agree on.The message was clear — scrap the backstop. Replace with common sense proposals. Anything less is unacceptable.So, what should the Government do now Obviously, it should honour the pledges of all major parties and carry out Brexit speedily and cleanly, preferably with a deal, but failing that, without a deal.That is what the public was promised and that is what the public expects.I have lost count of the number of members of the public who have come up to me, astonished bythe “naivety of a House of Commons who threw away our strongest negotiating card, the threat of No Deal”.It might be politically dficult. It might need courage. But nothing  will suffice.Ignoring the millions of protest votes and spoilt ballot papers will lead to nothing but further misery.The public will respect an admission that mistakes have been made.It will respect an attempt to reconnect the Conservative Party with its voters, activists and members.To ignore one of the angriest responses we have ever witnessed at election time would be suicidal. Surely nobody wants that  Face up, be realistic and put right the mistakes.Go back to the EU and give it one last chance. Renegotiate an acceptable agreement, or we will leave calmly and speedily without a deal.Scrap the European Elections and set the date for leaving as June . It is the only way forward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody trusts Mrs May and for good reason. She has broken too many promises.She insisted we would leave the EU customs union which sets our trade policy and our tarfs with other countries.Now she is ready to tear up this pledge, leaving Britain in limbo with no say and no gain. We will also abandon hard-won trade-union reforms and accept the sort of red tape that has seen EU joblessness rates soar.The PM is being pressed to allow a second referendum — rejected, until now, as a total betrayal of the first one.Will she go wobbly on this promise, too The stark truth is that Mrs May should not even be in charge of talks.She is now working her notice with no authority as PM. She should have been kicked out after her catastrophic general election shambles.Jezza has also upset voters by putting his Downing Street ambitions and a hunger for a general election ahead of the national interest.Voters knew exactly what they were doing last week when they gave a V-sign to both parties. They will give them an even bigger kickingthe EU poll goes ahead later this month.Parliament has failed. MPs have defied the will of the people by refusing to enact the democratic choice made in  to leave the European Union.Voters will use Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party as a stick to beat them with.Farage is a much more challenging figure this time round.The slightly raffish former merchant banker has grown out of his “cheeky chappie” Ukip image. He is now electable. Fed-up punters, both Tory and Labour, will vote for him in their millions.Unless the Tories wake up very quickly, dump Mrs May and pick a genuine pro-Brexit leader, he will be fielding a party of his own MPs in Parliament after the next election.The Brexit Party will have its first MP in just a month’s timeJacob Rees-Mogg’s sister Annunziata wins the Peterborough by-election on June . Smug Remainers should now see how much they are out of step with the great British majority.The likes of Anna “Suck It Up” Soubry and co-conspirator Dominic Grieve will pay the price as their Change UK party sinks without trace, swamped by a pro-Brexit surge.Pro-EU Lib Dems are a phantom party, led by ghostly Vince Cable, a bolt-hole for voters who can stomach neither Labour nor Tory.Cynics claim this is the end of the two-party system.Labour, under its present leadership, certainly cannot win on its own.People are fed up with Brexit.

You can’t simply take something off somebody and refuse to pay them the proper price.Nobody will shed a tear for the handsomely paid CEOs in Corbyn’s line of fire.

And we need to find out what.”It wasn’t, however, until Gill Biggeloe was unmasked as the latest bad apple, that the episode really lost the plot.Firstly by trying to repeat series four’s “Urgent exit required” text trick.Then by turning sweet, little ginger Tina, who went for Biggeloe in the toilet with a kne, into a member of the OCG death cult. And finally by asking us to believe DI Cottan’s death twitches signalled four people were H.For some, I know, this will have been a step too far, but I’m still keeping the LoD faith.It may demand a lot of viewers and take risks, but that’s what all great dramas should do.And,some don’t come off, it’s one of the few home-made shows that can usually fall back on its script or the astonishing performances of its cast.Particular plaudits this series, of course, go to Adrian Dunbar who’s turned Superintendent Ted Hastings into a television legend and, in these crucyingly right-on times, reminded us how much the public still loves a strong male character.I don’t expect such an important message to register with BBC drama, where every overpaid moron in the building will be running around shouting: “We need a female Ted.” But that’s their funeral.Line Of Duty will still have over ten million viewers hooked, whenever it s, because, as we learned in the closing credits, its integrity, storyline and main characters all endure: Arnott’s been exonerated after shooting Tina.OCG member Ryan’s at police training college.

I can see why they want the EU to do it for them.The party sent out a message from their new account saying their website and Twitter address had changed.But their website and emails were still redirecting to the old social media address this afternoon.Interim leader Heidi Allens account was still pointing people to the joke handle too.The gaffe is just the latest in a string of humiliations for the new party, which launched earlier this year.One of its candidates was forced to stand down within hours of being revealed - over offensive online comments.Ali Sadjady wrote on Twitter: “When I hear that  per cent of pick pockets caught on the London Underground are Romanian it kind of makes me want Brexit.”And despite pledging to support another referendum, he also wrote back in  that it would be a slap in the face of democracy.A blank space will also appear on the ballot papers later this month for the party - after their logo was rejected by the elections watchdog for having a hashtag in it.All other parties will have a logo there instead.On the partys launch today in February, Labour defector Angela Smith had to apologise for appearing to use the phrase “funny tinge” to describe ethnic minority people.Then when the rebel MPs – eight from Labour and three from the Tories – said they wanted to be known as Change UK they were hit with an angry response from petition website Change.org.Brits are also confused about what the official name for the party is.Theyve known to go by Change UK, The Independent Group, TIG, The Tiggers and other names.The For Change Now handle is likely to confuse their brand even more.The party wants a peoples vote on Brexit to try and overturn the result of the referendum and stay in the EU.The party have been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000477133484.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle prince harry birth misled","story":"A couple of weeks ago, that most “woke” of royal couples, Meghan and Harry, made a self-important statement to say there would be no statement about the forthcoming birth of the  squillionth in line to the throne.The nation stopped what they were doing for a moment, muttered “Yer what ” then gave a collective shrug and carried on trying to pay the bills.Then came yesterday’s weird stage management of what could have been a simple “They’ve had a healthy baby boy” statement made at a time that suited them.Instead, at pm, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duchess of Sussex was “in labour” then,  minutes later, followed it up with the news that it was a lb oz boy who, it later transpired, had arrived in the world in the early hours of that morning.So why the smoke and mirrors nonsense  It begs the question: If they put out misinformation about something so innocent, why should we believe what they say in any future statements As the old saying goes, “Don’t start drama and then say you hate drama”.Prince Harry has a special place in our hearts for many reasons, but particularly because he lost his mother at such a young age and was forced by royal duty to walk behind her coffin in full view of the world — a move that, today, seems even more unthinkable than it did then.So it’s understandable that he wanted to keep that most private of moments — the birth of his first child — out of the public gaze for a few precious hours. Fair enough.Equally, no one was much bothered whether or not Meghan came out on the steps of a hospital  seconds after giving birth. Each to their own and all that.But being Hollywood-style “woke” means you can’t just quietly get on with it and let your actions speak for themselves.No, you have to make grand declarations about your right-on credentials, such as “climate change is a very important issue” or “racism is abhorrent” as , by not making such virtue-signalling statements, the rest of us disagree and need to be enlightened.And so, rather than just announcing the birth when it suited them, they issued a rather pompous and bewildering press release to tell us in advance that they wanted to “keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private”.Asthe Press and public were constantly banging on the door of their easily accessible, terraced house, demanding to knowlittle Wayne or Waynetta had arrived yet.This push-back, following as it did the very public ghosting of Meghan’s father Thomas, risked alienating those members of the public with a genuine fondness for the prince and his new we.But happily, all the nonsense was forgotten the moment Harry bounded in to the stables area at Windsor Castle, where a select few of the world’s media were assembled.As the horses behind him gazed disinterestedly into the middle distance, his obvious delight at becoming a father was written all over his face.This was the Labrador puppy-esque Harry of old, and thanks to his excellent “How women do that is beyond comprehension” remark, he’s now firmly reinstated as the uncomplicated, cheeky chappie we all have a soft spot for.So, a heartfelt congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the birth of their first child.And moving forward, perhaps a little less of the stage-management and self-important virtue-signalling would be wise.In other words, take a leaf out of our admirable Queen’s book and just show us what you’re made of, rather than tell.PRINCESS CHARLOTTE celebrated her fourth birthday last week with a party at Kensington Palace.One can only imagine what a hot ticket that was at her primary school.Not among the children, silly. I mean the parents.The fevered anticipation at school pick-up time must have been palpable.Is there a gilt-edged stfyin the backpack or not Should they wait until they’re in the car before looking Or should they just fall to their knees in the playground right now for a spot of desperate, unseemly rummaging In the event, Prince William described it as “a rowdy party” which suggests that he and Kate swerved any potential breach of social etiquette by inviting the whole class. Phew.But of course, small children, the elderly or infirm would have had no chance in the face of such disastrous selfishness.QUEEN the band are now richer than our actual monarch following the worldwide success of their movie Bohemian Rhapsody.Guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor are the brains behind the biopic, which focuses on former frontman Freddie Mercury, who died in .But perhaps the smartest of them all is bassist John Deacon, who, despite being asked to be involved in the planning and production of the movie, didn’t even reply to the email – preferring to live a non-famous, quiet le in West London with his we and kids.While still benefiting from the enormous royalty cheques, of course.SO let’s get this straight. Former Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked from his post based on accusations from people unknown and “evidence” he’s not allowed to see.This Government is getting more like the Stasi with each passing day.EMMA THOMPSON has been branded a “first class hypocrite” after lecturing the rest of us on climate change then hopping on a commercial jet.Was she on a mercy mission to the socialist haven of Venezuela, where the political and economic crisis has resulted in violence and helpless families being wracked by poverty and death Nope, thought not. She was on her way to New York for business meetings.But hey, do as I say, not as I do. Isn’t that the luvvie way The surreptitiously taken photo of her in seat F was accompanied by exquisite detail of her Laurent-Perrier champagne and beef carpaccio consumption.And according to one report, her share of the carbon dioxide generated by the flight was “the same as that emitted by heating an average house for nine months”.While I could extrapolate for hourson climate change data and its possible outcomes and solutions, I instead find my attention drting towards the more compelling conundrum of . . . who nobbled Dame Emma at ,ft Given that the first-class compartment of the BA jet only seats , it has all the makings of an excellent TV mystery in which all the exits are sealed, Miss Marple comes on board, and the perpetrator is eventually unmasked.Except, in this case, they’d be a national hero.STRICTLY dancer Katya Jones has reportedly been demoted from having a celeb pairing in the next series because her snog with last year’s partner Seann Walsh was deemed “unprofessional” by BBC bosses.

I don’t think that I’ll [deliver] another baby that size the normal way in my career… it’s pretty unreal.”Annika told the publication that it was unusual for newborns to weigh that much, let alone be delivered without a caesarean.However, the midwe said there were no signs that Nicolina was carrying a much larger baby, as she “never looked enormous”.Tobiass older brother, Sage, aged , was vastly lighter when born, weighing eight pounds and ten ounces.Had the boys size been known prior to his birth there “would have been a lot of pressure fromto have a C-section”, Annika said, adding that it was probably a blessing no one realised how big he was.Nicolina said that when the birth “got a bit much” she asked for gas, and was given rementanil, which is a very short acting but strong pain-relieving drug, similar to Pethidine.But, she “did not have an epidural”.Nicolina, who eats organic food, told the New Zealand Herald that her height probably disguised Tobias’s size, as she is ft ins.The down-to-earth mum added that during her pregnancy, Tobias’s kicks were “really sore” and her stomach felt “so heavy” that she thought, “man, am I soft ”And his birth last Wednesday wasn’t drama-free because, after being induced as she was two weeks overdue, his shoulder became stuck in her pelvis.Nicolina explained: “He came out head first and once my midwe realised, she pressed the emergency button.“Heaps of doctors came in and helped pull him out.“Everybody was like, ‘wow, what a big baby’ and ‘how big is he’ everyone was really shocked.”Given his surprise size, Nicolina’s first port of call after leaving hospital was the nearest shops – as none of his newborn-sized clothes fitted.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need to promote activities, services, experiences which connect people and which you just can’t do sitting at home.’But Mr Brokenshire’s comments threatened to spark ridicule from store giants furious at Government apathy over the , high street jobs that have been lost in the last year alone.Mr Brokenshire also criticised town halls for hitting motorists with sky-high parking fees - and suggested that had also had an impact on falling footfall.And he made an appeal to Brits to do their own bit to save high streets with a new ‘think before you click’ attitude.He said: “Next time you flip open the laptop or browse on your mobile for that new outfit for yourself or toys for the children or a special gt for a friend, think about taking a trip out to bag that bargain. It’s often onlyyou touch it, see it and try it that you’ll know it’s right for you.“That’s what will continue to make our high streets special in providing experiences which shopping from the sofa can simply never do.”The Government has spent £ billion in business rate support to help high street stores and has overhauled planning rules to make it easier to build new homes above shops and at the centre of towns and cities.Last year Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged £ million to the Future High Streets Fund to reinvigorate high streets.And Mr Brokenshire also pointed to the Government’s Open Doors’ project that will allow empty high street outlets to be taken over by community groups.“Councils have an important role to play in designing and supporting the vibrant town centres of our future.“It is, of course, up to local authorities to set parking charges but I would urge all councils to think carefully before introducing sharp increases that could turn more people into stay at home shoppers.“Councillors in Ashford saw a surge in shoppers in their town centre after they cut parking fees and put on popular public events to encourage people back to the high street.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bubbly and hard-working graphic designer Samantha Ewen, , was found dead in her home in west Hull by her parents on October , . An hearing at Hull Coroneraposs Court today heard she had taken her own le after she grew out of her depth with mounting debts.Samantha left several notes at her home, including one to police saying she had killed herself, reports Hull Live .Another note, written to her parents and her sister, said Ms Ewen had received a high court writ after a friend had driven her car without insurance and injured a cyclist during an accident in ,    In the note, Samantha said she had no prior knowledge of the accident and the claim was for £,.  The note read: I became out of my depth. I am sorry for the mess I have left you with, this was my mistake. I love you all to the moon and back. Paying tribute, a statement from her mother read: Growing up, Samantha was a very happy, bubbly and social girl. She learnt languages with ease and when we moved to South Africa she picked up the Afrikaans language. She has the South African way of making a plan to find a solution. She was very good in that mindset and was a hard worker. Samantha, who had attended Brough Primary School and for a year at South Hunsley Secondary School, had previously sought medication for depression, but was happy according to her family. She had wanted to secure a job in Eswatini, also known as Swaziland, in southern Africa where her mum and dad moved to when she was aged , however, she was unable to get a work permit due to her British citizenship and ed to Hull with her sister Kirsty.    Samantha had worked in public relations and marketing job sectors and worked at Viking FM and set up a marketing company with her then husband which led her to becoming a graphic designer. She then launched her own company Curious Echo in , where she produced work for NHS trusts across the country. Her mother told the inquest that her daughter revealed she worked until am or am and was very dedicated to making her business work. She had even allowed Samantha to borrow large sums of money from her to see her through after payments from her clients dropped. However, she never mentioned the payments as it would hurt her daughteraposs pride. However, Samantha struggled to keep her head above the water, and admitted not keeping up to date with her tax s in her suicide note. Her death had been pre-planned and she had organised her parents to dog-sit her two pets the night that she chose to take her own le, the hearing was told. Samanthaaposs parents entered her property at around .pm on October  last year to see the heartbreaking note on her unlocked front door to read their daughteraposs body would be tragically found inside. Humberside Police officer Hayley Browne said there were no suspicious circumstances or third party involvement in Samanthaaposs death. Returning a conclusion of suicide, area coroner Rosemary Baxter said: Samantha had been in fact struggling with le in the months before her death.

The government is offering them transition cash and a one-off back payment after accepting many of them lost out. Yet months after the last claimants moved to UC in January, the Department for Work and Pensionsstill hasnapost coughed up that extra money. Instead, it is on hold because the cash is tied up with wider UC regulations that havenapost passed into law.And the claimants could now face yet another delay after the High Court ruled the cash pot was unlawful.A judge last week backed two claimants who argued the back payments, worth just £ per month, short-changed them by around £.    Despite the long delay so far, Tory Justin Tomlinson today said the DWP has not yet decided whether to appeal the High Court case or cough up the money, or how. The Minister for Disabled People told MPs: We will be considering all options in light of the judgement and we will update the House in due course.Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft said a constituent had now been without his back payments for nine months.She said: In March I raised with the minister the case of a constituent with a severe brain injury. [He] applied to Universal Credit in August  and immediately lost his Severe Disability Premium. The minister requested that I write to him. As yet I have received no response. My constituent has now been without SDP for almost nine months. This vulnerable inidual needs action. will the minister get a grip of this  Mr Tomlinson replied: I apologise that I havenapost seen sight of that yet. I will make sure as a matter of urgency that I do and I will respond personally.    Labour MP Ruth George said one of her constituents is now owed almost £, by the DWP. She said he was building up rent arrears and in danger of eviction. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: These are people who by definition are already having to cope with some of the most severe medical conditions and with disabilities. They should not have to fight through the court for the support they should be entitled to. They deserve better. Mr Tomlinson said the Government havenapost taken any money out of the system, prompting groans from some MPs. He said around one million disabled households are receiving on average around £ a month more on Universal Credit than they would have had on legacy benefits. But Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams claimed the department was robbing Peter to pay Paul.

The Bill will make it an offence for an operator of a travelling circus in England to use a wild animal in the circus. Should MPs agree, travelling circuses in England which currently use wild animals will have until  January  before it becomes an offence to use the wild animal in exhibition or performance. There are currently  wild animals left in travelling circuses.But critics say the new bill only comes after years of heel dragging from the Tories and campaigning from charities, activists and Labour .The bill is virtually identical to Trudy Harrison MP’s Ten Minute Rule Private Member’s Bill which was co-sponsored by Sue Hayman MP, introduced on th March , which had not yet received a Second Reading . There have been several similar Private Member’s Bills in previous Parliaments: - - Kevin Foster MP - - Will Quince MP - - Jim Fitzpatrick MP - - Thomas Docherty MP. In  the then- Labour government consulted on introducing a ban on the use of wild animals in travelling circuses, with the proposals receiving % support.    The Coalition Government said in  it wanted to look into a ban on ethical grounds but needed to change the law because there was not enough evidence that a ban could be justied on welfare grounds. In the meantime the Government introduced a licensing scheme under the Animal Welfare Act . The Welfare of Wild Animals in Travelling CircusesRegulations  came into force on  January  and are set to expire on  January . Last year DEFRA confirmed the government would not be renewing the regulations. Only two travelling circuses have been licensed under the  Regulations to use wild animal acts. The Government published a post- implementation review of the Regulations in January . The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committeeaposs main recommendation that the ban should not apply to all wild animals was not accepted by the Government. The Wild Animals in Travelling CircusesAct  already prohibits the use of wild animals in travelling circuses in Scotland. The Welsh Government consulted on a ban in October  after an independent review of the evidence on animal welfare of wild animals in travelling and non-travelling circuses and has announced a ban will be introduced in . Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland Executive has investigated the possibility of an all-island approach to the issue of wild animals in circuses through adoption of a Code of Practice. The Republic of Ireland banned wild animals in circuses in .  Ahead of the billaposs second reading, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: Travelling circuses are no place for wild animals in the st century and I am pleased that this legislation will put an end to this practice for good. Today’s announcement follows other measures we have taken to strengthen our position as a world leader on animal protection. This includes our ban on ivory sales to protect elephants, and delivering Finn’s Law to strengthen the protection of service animals.

The former solicitor refused to quit the Commons but last week the electorate took the decision out of her hands and she became the first-ever MP to be ousted through a recall petition. Now, Labour, the Tories and the new Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, who holds a rally in the city tonight, will battle it out with other parties until polling day on June .    The Brexit Party is yet to unveil its candidate for what will be its first election for a Westminster seat, where three in five voters backed Leave. Sprightly -year-old Bill Marriott, who was cycling to the swimming pool for an afternoon dip, was scornful of both Labour and the Toriesapos prospects. “Labour donapost know which way they want to go, they are arguing among themselves,” said the retired Tesco produce manager.“When Theresa May first came to power I thought she was going to be another Maggie Thatcher but she lost her way. Itaposs a great pity.”Bill went on: “Iaposm sick and tired of Brexit. When it comes on the TV I switch it off, Iaposm sick to death of it. “Regardless of what people voted – for or against – these politicians and MPs should respect the wishes of the public and get on with it and stop squabbling among themselves. “Nigel Farageaposs party is going to have a lot of votes. Heaposs very well known and will certainly liven Peterborough up a bit and put it in the spotlight.”  Civil servant Linda Woodham, , signed the petition to oust Onasanya. “Itaposs the start of politicians being held accountable for their actions,” she said in between bites of an iced doughnut as she sat on a bench during her lunch break. Linda believed the fight could be dominated by domestic issues such as “housing, school places and hospitals” – which could help Labour and hit the Conservatives. But she added: “The Brexit Party will get a lot of support. “Nigel Farage has been here a couple of times, he has shown an interest.” Lindaaposs pal Tina Jones, , said of Onasanyaaposs fall from grace: “I donapost see how she could carry on. “I donapost understand how you can be an MPyouaposve got a criminal record.” Retired salesman Graham Raywood, , agreed, saying: “In a nutshell, itaposs a ludicrous situation. “Here you have someone thataposs supposed to have legal training and is prepared to sacrice her livelihood, her reputation, for basically trying to avoid three points on her licence. It makes no sense at all.    “Even someone without legal training would have just taken the points. “I donapost understand the risk.” He believed the by-election will be tight, with a campaign focused on Brexit and immigration. “Peterborough is obviously very marginal,” said Graham. “The big issue is immigration and thataposs what will probably get the next candidate elected. “Brexit is always an issue – people are getting fed up with it now.”Told former MP and ex-Celebrity Big Brother star George Galloway will fight the seat, Graham said: “And his credibility is what  Impersonating a cat on TV ”Bar maid Hannah McIntosh, , will not vote on June . “I have no interest in politics, I know nothing that they stand for,” she said. “I didnapost vote in the referendum, I donapost know enough to make an educated guess. “I guess I mightI felt like politics was affecting my le directly, but at the minute nothing does.” Hannahaposs boss Sean Page, , who plans to spoil his ballot paper, described Farage as “a bit of a tw*t”. He said: “The manner in which he tries to present a lot of his thoughts comes across as very bigoted.”  Asked why Farage might find Peterborough an attractive target, he added: “We have a lot of aposforeignersapos looking to work – they are just looking for a job. “They come here and then you have the Brit that sits there going, aposI canapost get a job but all these people around me are getting jobsapos. “Thataposs probably why thereaposs that ignorance in a lot of voters.” Sean believes Brexit chaos has unleashed “uncertainty” - and was keen to highlight what he saw as his cityaposs ersity. “Peterborough has historically been a very multicultural city,” he said.    “Iaposm a second-generation immigrant – my grandfather came from Italy to work in the brickyards. “Thereaposs a massive Pakistani and Indian contingent in Peterborough, a huge east European contingent. “I donapost see it clashing but there are quite segregated parts of the city.”  Chris Killigrew, , has run a plant stall in Cathedral Square for seven years. She had no sympathy for Onasanya, who lasted  months as the cityaposs MP.    “Iaposm glad sheaposs gone, I donapost think she should be in a position of power after all that,” said Chris. She believes Brexit will dominate the campaign, three years after the city voted to quit the EU. “Itaposs still very much to Leave – thereaposs anger that we havenapost left yet,” said Chris. In a familiar complaint against politicians, she said voters were “fed up of them all”. In more bad news for Jeremy Corbyn and the Prime Minister, she thinks the Brexit Party could attract big support as electors shun the two main parties. Echoing fears about the impact of immigration on this corner of the country, she went on: “Thereaposs a big community of Polish and east Europeans in Peterborough and surrounding areas. “There are waits for doctorsapos and hospital appointments – you canapost get a dentist.” But she might also boycott the poll. “Iaposm tempted not to vote at all because there doesnapost seem any point,” she said. “We voted Brexit but itaposs not happening and itaposs never going to be a full-on Brexit.” Romanian Avram Jianu, , came to the UK when he was three years old and believes racism has increased since the  referendum.    Avram, who was selling toys from a stall and also works in a Marks and Spencer warehouse, said in slightly broken English and with a Yorkshire accent: “Here there are a lot of immigrants, east Europeans. “I have noticed a change in how people look at me since Brexit – they think I am stealing, I rob them. “They think I come into England to steal. I am working, I am paying taxes.” He too believes Brexit will be the major theme of the by-election. “Brexit will make the Pound go down. Food is getting expensive but the wages stay the same,” he said. “When people voted, they didnapost know what they voted for. “Young people didnapost vote, it was people in their s, s and s who voted to leave.” Youngsters, along with everyone  in Peterborough aged  and over, will have their chance to vote next month, deciding whether they boost Labouraposs hopes of winning a general election or whether they give the PM an unexpected bounce. Or whether they hand victory to the Brexit Party.

Senior cabinet minister David Lidington confirmed there was now not enough time to get a Brexit deal through Parliament.And he admitted that the UK may not now leave the European Union until August , after the start of MPs’ summer recess. Downing Street said the Prime Minister “deeply regrets” the elections - which could cost an estimated £m - going ahead. The humiliating admission comes despite repeated assurances by Mrs May that she was determined to prevent voters going to the polls. In March, she told MPs: “As Prime Minister I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than the June .” The increased pressure on her already fragile leadership came as the Tories backbench chief again told her to set a departure date.  Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  committee, was thought to have warned her that unless she did she could face another challenge. Grassroots Tory activists will also hold an emergency summit in June to hold a no confidence vote in the PM.Cross-party Brexit talks kicked off again today with Labour sources downplaying claims they were ready to strike a deal. Both Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn had said last week’s poor local election results showed the public wanted them to get on with Brexit.The key issue of a customs union was still iding the parties with Labour MPs insisting there would need to be a confirmatory public vote while Tory MPs warning the compromise could permanently fracture the party. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said: “I’m not a believer in a customs union as a sustainable long-term solution.” Mr Lidington claimed the Government was “redoubling our efforts” to get its Brexit deal ratied by the start of July, so  MEPs elected on May  month will never have to take their seats. But he admitted wrangling could continue until MPs go on their summer holidays, delaying Brexit Day until August  when MEPs would give up their seats after just three weeks.    “We very much hoped that we would be able to get our exit sorted and have the treaty concluded so that those elections did not have to take place. But legally they do have to take place... so those will now go ahead,” he said. “But we will be redoubling our efforts and talks with MPs of all parties to try to make sure that the delay after that is as short as possible. “Ideally we’d like to be in a situation where those MEPs never actually have to take their seat at European Parliament - certainly, to get this done and dusted by the summer recess.” The PM’s spokesman admitted the public would feel “great frustration” that the elections were taking place. Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman predicted the Tories would “get a kicking” and be down to  MEPs. The new Brexit Party could scoop up the Leave vote while Remain supporters could flock to pro-EU parties like the Lib Dems. It came as a handful of Brexiteer Tories hinted they could back a second referendum to resolve the issue once and for all.

The newest royal entered the world at :am yesterday morning, weighing lb oz and mum and baby are both doing well. Meghan Markle had hoped to have a natural birth at the Frogmore Cottage home she shares with Prince Harry in Windsor. But her dreams were dashed now it has been reported she had to be taken to the Portland Hospital in London by her security team to deliver her son. The plans were so secret that senior royals were not even told of the move, it is claimed. For all the latest royal baby updates, follow our live blog here.   It is understood that Meghan was around a week overdue. It had been widely rumoured that Meghan and harry would chose NHS Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey for the birth of their son. But it seems the couple opted for a far more luxurious venue to welcome the much-anticipated baby boy. So, what will Meghan have experienced inside the Portland Hospitalaposs maternity ward, which costs £,. First of all thereaposs the previous A-list patients.    Victoria Beckham gave birth to two of her four children in the hospital and itaposs also where Jamie Oliveraposs we, Jools, opted to have her babies. Jerry Hall, Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson, Spice Girl  Geri Halliwell  , Benazir Bhutto, Trudi Styler,  Patsy Kensit  , Victoria Wood and Julie Walters are all reported to have given birth at the hospital. Meghan and Harry are also not the first royals to become parents at the high-end hospital. Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew delivered their first-born, Princess Beatrice, at The Portland. Then thereaposs the fine dining. The hospital boasts suites with sitting rooms and fridges stocked full of Champagne.    You can pick which doctor you want andyou donapost fancy pushing then even opt for a caesarean. Doctors are on hand to dish out medicine to stop your milk coming and a nursery will look after your baby around the clock – at £, a night – until you feel ready to face the world. Chief executive Janene Madden, who runs a staff of , boasts: “I have seen somebody spend £,. “We have princesses from the middle east who deliver here quite regularly. We have celebrities and iniduals of very high net worth and they used to getting what they want.  “Andthey want  additional rooms or  additional rooms we will provide it. “As long as that woman or husband can pay for what they are requesting we will do our best to provide that. “What I can advocate here is it is like having a holiday, when you deliver at the Portland you get to use the nursery and your baby is only bought back for feeding time so you absolutely after two to three nights you leave here fit and well and ready to face the challenges of motherhood.” For those who fancy the luxury on offer be warned, you need deep pockets, as a basic consultant led package costs upwards of £, which doesnapost include the doctor. And choosing your own doctor at the American-owned hospital can easily double the cost.  There is certainly no shortage of midwives at the hospital, with a team of around  on hand for mums-to-be. As well as maternity care the Portland offers a range of high end facilities to guests at itaposs  rooms, there is even a private in house photography company for snaps of the babies and gt shop offers trinkets like silver and bronze casts of babies feet. A hotel standard kitchen, based in the one in five-star hotel The Dorchester, provides around the clock fine dining and while in the NHS breakfast costs as little as p in the Portland there is a team of  preparing any dish the mothers desire. One cooks boasts: “We can get foie gras, lobsters and oysterspeople want they, we have fantastic champagne, Dom Pérignonpeople want it.” The food is all delivered on silver platters.  While mums are treated to one on one care newborns cared for by staff, there is nursery on first floor and babies are electronically tagged with a computer system monitoring their exact location at any one time. And new babies donapost have to sleep in standard plastic cots. Dragons of Walton Street has a range available for use at the hospital which includes a Moses basket costing £, and even a four-poster cot. AndMeghan fancied a pamper once her baby boy arrived Molton Brown toiletries are available for everyone who stays there. The cheapest maternity package starts at £, but some parents have spent up to £, to ensure their child is born in utmost luxury.  And almost half of all mums at the hospital opt for a Caesarean section, wth one consultant known for doing a good scar. The care doesnapost end when mum and baby are discharged. Each are provided with a goodie bag containing top-of-the-range tys, Champagne and a free photoshoot. Just hours after Meghan delivered her baby son, whose name is yet t be announced, a beaming Harry gave a press conference announcing the arrival of the baby. He said: Iaposm very excited to announce that Meghan and myself had a baby boy this morning, a very healthy baby boy.  I havenapost been at many births. This is definitely my first birth - it was amazing, absolutely incredible. Iaposm so incredibly proud of my we. And as every father and parent would say, your baby is absolutely amazing. Harry was at his weaposs side throughout the birth and the couple will now spend a few days celebrating as a family. Harry added: How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension. But weaposre both absolutely thrilled. But this little thing is absolutely to-die-for so Iaposm absolutely over the moon. Itaposs been the most amazing experience I could ever have possibly imagined.

It was also widely understood that Meghan had wanted to give birth at home but then late on Monday it broke that, in fact, Baby Sussex had been born at Portland Hospital in London. It has emerged tonight how, on Sunday, the royal couple, and Meghanaposs mum Doria, had travelled in secret from Windsor to the posh private hospital where the child was delivered.    The trio are said to have travelled in a two-car convoy, with only a handful of people informed, for the -minute journey into the capital. Escorted by Scotland Yard, they were able to slip into the hospital unnoticed and then exit in the same manner, claims the Daily Mail. Details on the birth are yet to emerge, for instance it is not knownMeghan was induced. But we do know a very healthy boy was born weighing lbs oz at .am. Harry and Meghan are then claimed to have spent four hours at the hospital with their newborn child, before the prince is believed to have contacted aides to tell them the happy news.    The new parents and Doria then travelled back to Frogmore - where Harry is said to have got two hours kip. Meanwhile, for reasons that still arenapost clear, the Palace released a statement that Meghan was in labour at .pm - seven hours after the child was born. Then, less than  minutes later, Harry went to the stables at Windsor Castle for a prearranged TV interview where he confirmed the birth of his son. In the run up to the birth, it was the consensus that Meghan and Harry had wanted to have a home birth.  According to reports, this is still believed to be the case, however, with the mum-to-be overdue they are said to have started making other plans. It is claimed that the pair had started speaking to medical staff at Portland - the site of multiple celebrity and royal births - as well as packing essentials. Then on Sunday evening, they are thought to have been taken into central London but not under blue flashing lights for the birth to take palce. Meghan is understood to be feeling fine today. A royal source told the Mirror: “Meghan is doing really well. “She’s loving le and is just really enjoying being home with her family. “Together with Harry they are soaking up every minute.” Meanwhile, we should get our first glimpse of the royal baby on Wednesday - and possibly a name.

Facing reporters on Monday following the birth of his baby son he was bubbling with joy, bursting with pride… and clearly traumatised by what he’d just experienced. “How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension,” Harry said, holding his head in his hands as images of blood, sweat and tearsseemed to flash before him. Oh yes, Harry, it’s beyond comprehension alright. No amount of binge watching One Born Every Minute can prepare a first-time parent for the reality of the labour ward – the sheer excruciating agony of childbirth so alien to us in our cotton-wool culture, the stench, the mess and the total loss of dignity that comes with it. Although by that point dignity is of as much interest as those fancy dan birth plans mums-to-be are encouraged to write before they realise they might as well ask to be transported to the maternity unit on the back of a unicorn. My husband, who’s witnessed dozens of post-mortems in his job, still says he’d rather watch a body being carved up than another birth. “Like Vietnam without the helicopters” was his verdict after our daughter was born.    My friend’s ft ins st husband said after baby number two HE just could not go through it all again. So he didn’t – when number three popped out he popped out to the hospital cafe. And I can’t say that I blame him. “I really couldn’t face watching the woman I love go through that again,” he said. Everything in our world today is so clean, ordered, tidy and managed that childbirth is now one of the few occasions in le where we’re reminded all too clearly that we too are animals. But it’s hugely humbling as a result. The nicest thing I thought Prince Harry said in his interview was “I’m so proud of my we”. For now he knows that Meghan isn’t just beautul, talented and smart – she’s rock hard to boot. It’s still not known why the couple had to rush to London’s Portland Hospital for the birth. But presumably labour wasn’t plain sailing. So Harry has every right to be proud of his we. But take note Harry, this is just the beginning of how rock hard Meghan can be now she’s become a mum.

James Jorge De Sousa Stayton, known as JJ, fell to his death from the Whispering Gallery in St Paul’s Cathedral after skipping lectures for two months due to mental health problems, his family says. The -year-old died from multiple injuries when he fell at the London landmark on April .His grieving family say they want universities to sound alarm bells when students stop attending classes and offer extra help to all young people suffering from mental health problems, Gloucestershire Live reports.The family described James as an“intelligent, funny and passionate” young man. They have started a fundraising campaign in memory of the popular -year-old from Ross-on-Wye who was a history student at Queen Mary University in London.  A full inquest has yet to determine the official cause of death but a GoFundMe page set up by his elder sister Sapphire in memory of her brother says: “On April , , JJ took his own le at the age of . “He had been struggling with his mental health, the extent of which he had kept hidden from his family and friends.” Describing him has an “intelligent, funny and passionate young man, with strong interests in history and drama”, she said his family and friends have seen it a mission to create change around the stigma of mental health. She says they want to “ensure help is available to young people when they need it most”, and that includes when they are away from home at university and college. “We aim to push for a change in protocols - specically in universities -  to prevent young adults slipping under the radar,” the fundraising page says. “Currently, there is no convention, that we are aware of, where someone is alerted to a signicant change in circumstance - when students stop attending class, for example.  “We learned, following his death, that JJ had not been going to university for at least  months, isolating himself from everyone. “Despite communications with the university, they were unable to inform us of these changes in his attendance. “Had we known,it is possible something could have been done to help him.” Within days, the campaign has raised more than £, towards the charity Rowing Together for Healthy Minds. Donating to the appeal, Joyce Seabrook wrote: JJ was a good friend of mine in first year. We lost contact in the beginning of the year but I have really fond memories of him. His smile and humour were brilliant and he was such a kind person. It’s time that people had more of an awareness of students and their mental health - so we can stop tragic events like this. My thoughts are with you all. Shortly after Jamesapos death senior coroner Alison Hewitt opened an inquest at City of London Coroneraposs Court and said there was a  witness statement which confirmed the young man had fallen to his death. But there were no further details and Ms Hewitt added: “And that has been the evidence which will open this inquest.  “Further evidence has to be gathered, that is taking place as we speak - I am not going to fix a date because the evidence is still being gathered.”  After the inquest his family issued a tribute through City of London Police, saying they were in deep shock at the loss of a beautul, talented and intelligent son who had a deep passion for history  and a wicked sense of humour. “Words cannot adequately express the devastation we feel, nor the love we have for him.

And they do not get hairier than this ­selection of face fuzz-toting folk which History Revealed magazine has put together. Fidel Castro Castro’s beard was part of his public persona and he wore it as a symbol of his triumph during the Cuban Revolution, which was finally victorious on January , . The CIA concocted numerous attempts at assassinations or discrediting him by attacking his image. One plan was to dust his shoes with toxic thallium salts while he travelled overseas, making his beard fall out. However, the trip was cancelled. Despite the CIA’s efforts, Castro’s beard lived to fight another day. Edward Maria Wingfield  As well as keeping your chin warm and for aesthetic appeal, sometimes beards can save your le. Edward Maria Wingfield was one of the financial backers of the Virginia Company of London. They established the colony of Jamestown in Virginia, with Wingfield becoming its first president. During a brutal Native American attack in , Wingfield was shot with an arrow – but only through his beard. The rest of him escaped unscathed. Thomas More  Thomas More was once a trusted mentor to Henry VIII.A deeply religious man, he could not reconcile himself with Henry’s break from the Catholic Church in  in order to orce his first we, Catherineof Aragon.More resigned from his role as Lord Chancellor and refused to swear an oath recognising Henry as the head of the Church of England. Beheaded in , on the chopping block he reportedly laid his beard out of the way and asked the executioner to spare it, noting “this hath not offended the king”. Blackbeard  Blackbeard was feared across the Caribbean Sea and the North American colonies. His nickname apparently came from his thick beard, where he would keep lit fuses to scare enemies. His smouldering whiskers terried some sailors so much they surrendered the moment he stepped on board their ship. His legacy inspired the idea of the pirate as a rogue of the seas. Real name Edward Teach, he was killed in  when cornered by the navy. Hans Steininger  Beards are not normally feared as being dangerous, but for one man excessive facial hair would be the death of him. Hans Steininger was mayor of the town of Braunauin the th century. He was renowned for his beard – believed to measure .ft – which he kept tucked in a pouch. In September , a fire broke out in the town. In the chaos, Steininger tripped over his beard and fell down some stairs, breaking his neck. Annie Jones  PT Barnum’s circus was full of curiosities, including bearded women. One of these was Annie Jones, who joined the show at just nine months old in . Billed as “The Infant Esau” – the biblical Esau being distinguished by his wealth of hair – Jones grew a full beard, moustache and sideburns. This was probably due to hirsutism, a condition that causes excessive body hair. As well as being one of the star attractions, Jones became a spokeswoman for the “freaks” in Barnum’s show and campaigned to rid the circus of the offensive term. Osiris  The Ancient Egyptians strangely preferred  beards to the real thing. Pharaohs, both male and female, would don metallic beards in order to emulate Osiris. The God of the Underworld and Judge of the Dead was often shown with a beard, and burial masks often had them. In , the beard on Tutankhamun’s mask broke and conservators reattached it hastily with glue, scratching the mask. Hans Langseth  The trophy for longest beard goes to Hans Langseth. A native of Norway, he emigrated to the US in . He began growing his beard at  for a local competition and carried on. A farmer by profession, for a while he travelled in a “freak show”. At his death in  it measured .ft. The beard resides in Washington DC’s Smithsonian Institution. Henry VIII  The Tudor king’s beard – or lack of – nearly sent the country into war back in . Henry and Francis I of France were attempting to arrange a meeting. Both kings had promised not to shave until they met one another.

Francis’ mother took this as a slight against her son and some swt diplomatic flattery was required to restore the peace. Abraham Lincoln  US president Abraham Lincoln is easily recognisable with his full beard. During his early political career, however, he was clean shaven. That was until he received a letter from -year-old Grace Bedell, a month before the  presidential election: “If you will let your whiskers grow, I will try and get the rest of them to vote for you. You would look a great deal better.” Lincoln replied to his young admirer, expressing concern that a beard would look silly. But within the month, he had grown a beard and won the election.

Another person on the plane told local media that the woman was taken off the aircraft, at Wellington Airport, New Zealand, for refusing to watch the safety video. The passenger said that she thought the airline was to blame for the episode. They suggested Air New Zealand should make a short safety film that is compulsory to watch - and should tell passengers they will be kicked off the planethey do not view it.   A police spokesman told Newshub that officers escorted the woman off the plane on Tuesday morning because she would not listen to crew members.The spokesman reportedly added that the passenger will receive a Civil Aviation Authority infringement notice relating to the use of a mobile phone. The Air New Zealand NZ flight was forced toto the gate in order for the woman to be taken off the plan, reports claim. The airline was in the headlines again last year after it made a aposcringe worthyapos safety video, featuring Kiwi artists rapping about how to prepare for a crash. New Zealand First MP Shane Jones blasted the film as embarrassing and said it trivialised safety. It was withdrawn less than six months after it was introduced.

It was quite a challenging thing to do.“We knew it would be the right thing to do but we weren’t sure how the public would respond.“We were pleasantly surprised.

they want to is something we can all be deeply proud of, and should celebrate with pride.”But Mr Stewart added it’s important to “look forward, rather than back”, and consider what actions have been

his possessions to fund a two-year volunteering mission across Africa and has ed with a renewed sense of perspective.During his travels across Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda Dominic witnessed violent election riots, contracted Malaria and suffered a iety of broken bones having fallen down a storm drain.Dominic, who is , told the Border : ldquoWe really donrsquot have any idea of how others live on the other side of the world in some of the poorest countries on earth.ldquoI spent most of my time living in slums, which ied from corrugated houses to mud houses with grass thatched roofs.During his time in Africa, Dominic acted as a trustee for Roll Out the Barrel Trust UK, a project that aims to help with water supply issues in some of the worldrsquos poorest countries.Dominic also helped found a charity in Kenya, The Sunflower Community Orphans Support Project.The organization helps feed orphaned children, many of whom are affected by poverty and HIV AIDS, by using the proceeds of a cafeacute selling food to the public.Dominic fully embraced the lestyle of the local community, enduring the same daily struggles faced by the local population.ldquoI experienced what it was like to have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude to le since ing to the UK in March.He added: ldquoAfter selling most of my things to help fund this mission I now own very few items and the ones I do own I appreciate more.ldquoI appreciate things

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

Therersquos natural field run off, from the field to the south.ldquoMost of that seems to occur to the west of the site, but wersquore going to prevent any more run off by installing a cut off drain all the way around the site which will collect the water.ldquoThis drain will be connected to a culvert which runs under the railway to the north, and eventually runs into the Eye.ldquoThe other issue is that surface water is getting into the combined sewer that serves this area, and is causing problems down stream.ldquoSome road gullies are connected into this combined sewer and are causing surcharge of the sewer and in some cases flooding.ldquoWersquove out careful design into this, and wersquore not taking surface water to the combined sewer, wersquore taking it to the culvert under the railway.ldquoIt will be taken off at a very attenuated rate, at just two litres a second, which is a very small amount of water. The culvert could take up to  litres.Following an hour-long discussion, councillors were finally able to decide that the proposals could go ahead, providing that in depth surveys were conducted into drainage and foul water flooding.The site will then be subject to planning conditions once the scale of the problem is known.Speaking in favour of approving the planning application, Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford said: ldquoWe have to ask ourselves: do the proposals represent a suitable development  I think yes they do.ldquoAre the proposals acceptable in terms of parking and road safety  I think yes they are.ldquoI am a little concerned about industrial traffic but I feel this could be mitigated by an industrial road.Lauderdale and Melrose councillor Tom Miers told the committee: ldquoI think for me the main concern is absolutely drainage and flooding.ldquoWe need to be absolutely certain that any new development will not exacerbate any existing problems.ldquoI think it would be useful to include a condition that we require written evidence that the development will not add to the issues.ldquoIt needs to be in black and white, that according to the evidence it will not create more problems.East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton said: ldquoThere must be some sort of attenuation to the drainage. If that work was done before construction starts, then that would be useful.ldquoIt would be the best option to make sure this is all in place before any work starts.Councillors voted to approve the application, with the exception of Galashiels and District councillor Sandy Aitchison, who voted against."},{"url":null,"title":"junior-choir-delights-with-anniversary-show","story":"REVIEWBy Revd Pamela StrachanEddleston Junior ChoirAN exploding lsquoTreble Clefrsquo culminated an evening of joyous music from the Eddleston Parish Church Junior Choir last Friday evening, as Musical Director, Lorraine Mulholland, cut the spectacular Pintildeata cake.Baked by one of the Junior Choir mothers, Teresa Bedford, the fabulous cake was a fitting tribute to  years of this little choir bringing its vitality and exuberance to worship in the church.As well as giving regular concerts over the years, the young singers have raised money for charity, made their own CD and brought joy to the elderly in residential homes in Peebles.The choir has also been the starting point for many talented young musicians who have gone on to become accomplished young soloists, as we heard on Friday evening.The programme began with a touching performance of lsquoHumility  Appreciationrsquo from The Little Triangleand was followed by solo pieces from past choir members.After learning the piano for merely a year, young Izzy Steele gave a confident performance of two solo pieces, along with a duet of Bobby Shafto.Izzy already plays with great expression as the audience heard Bobby cheerfully setting sail but then becoming queasy with seasickness only for his spirits to lt as he heads for home once again.Very competent performances followed by both Jenner Brownand Shona Sinclairas they demonstrated how participation in the Junior Choir has fostered their talent and love of music.Jenner played lsquoRussianrsquo by Martrei Blanter, Blue Dayand Allegro Assai rd Movement from Concertino in D Major by Ferdinand Kuchler.These pieces would have been a challenge for older players, but this young violinist played with great panache.Shona Sinclair gave a similarly spirited performance on the piano with Branle de la Torche by Michael Praetorius, Shadows by Walter Carrol and the lively Scott Joplin number, The Entertainer.Rowan Steele, older sister of Izzy, delighted the audience with her performance on fiddle, with Farewell to the Glenand A Set of Shetland Reels.Rowan and Jenner then performed together on violin and fiddle with The Love of the Islesand Stomach Steinway Man, written by Ian Lowthian who was born in the Scottish Borders where he still works as a music teacher and educator.The ten young singers who currently make up the Eddleston Junior Choir produce a lsquobig soundrsquo and sing with such obvious pleasure and enthusiasm.The Lemonade Kid by Peter Fardellgave them all scope for their exuberance, as did their repeat performance of A Midsummer Nightrsquos Dream by Kane and Kane.We were treated to this at the summer concert last year and such was the choirrsquos obvious delight in performing this number, we were told they requested to sing it again.That seems to be the secret of this young choirrsquos success all the young members thoroughly enjoy the singing and performing, the rhythm and the sheer pleasure of making music.Delighted parents in the audience confirmed how much their children enjoy belonging to the choir as Lorraine Mulholland was presented with bouquets and warmly thanked by the Reverend Calum Macdougall for her  years of dedication and commitment to so many young singers in Eddleston and Peebles.The Church, parents and the Eddleston community all owe a huge debt to this inspirational Musical Director and music teacher."},{"url":null,"title":"inspirational-stories-set-for-borders-book-festival","story":"INSPIRATIONAL stories will told at this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it.

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach.

And unfortunately, dear reader, there is much to worry about these days on that score.Read more: SNP declares war on cybernatsNowhere do we see it more than on social media. With this in mind, I applaud unequivocal attempts by prominent SNP figures, as outlined in yesterdayrsquos Herald, to denounce the online abuse spat out by some on their side of the constitutional debate, not just at opponents of independence, but anyone who dares say or tweet something, no matter how innocuous, that doesnrsquot chime entirely with their world view. Describing such keyboard warriors as ldquoweird, ldquocreepy, ldquopoisonous, ldquovicious ldquocowards, former party deputy Angus Robertson, MP Stewart McDonald and MEP Alyn Smith are absolutely right to point out that such trolling, bullying and harassment ndash much of it aimed specically at women ndash is not only out of order, but ultimately damaging to the cause they support.If anyone is in any doubt about the form this sort of intimidation takes, you need only look at last weekrsquos bullying of BBC Scotland journalist Emma Clford Bell. Researching a piece about Dundeersquos reaction to Nicolarsquos Sturgeonrsquos announcement on a possible second independence referendum, she did her job and appealed on social media for a pro-Union voice to appear among a ldquoiety of opinions ndash including pro-independence supporters ndash to be featured in the package. What followed was a pile-on of epic and bizarre proportions, as hundreds jumped on the bandwagon and accused her of bias, told her to ldquof*** off , that she was ldquoscum, a ldquoclown of a lassie and a ldquostupid bint.Primarily, this is a very personal ndash not to mention sexist ndash attack on Ms Clford Bell. But it also represents a worrying and increasingly common assault on the act and process of journalism itself, a wilful misunderstanding of what journalists do, a knowing conflation of news and comment, a perpetuation of the warped idea that ldquogood journalism is what I agree with, and ldquobad journalism is everything .Read more: SNP declares war on cybernatsMore than anything, it reflects a worrying lack of critical thinking. Indeed, some of the responses to those who criticised the bad behaviour are as grim as the initial attack blaming the victim, whatabouteryand reeling off old complaints about BBC presenters only makes it worse.

And since the current system encourages anonymity and duplicity, it can be hard to work out who or what is even real.The so-called lsquoCybernatsrsquo exist in a relatively tiny corner of social media, of course, their vitriol matched by those shouting about other extreme world views, most notably ldquoBrit Nats, Hard Brexiteers, Trump supporters and white supremacists.Theyrsquore all equally unsavoury, flourishing by using OTT, hysterical narratives to pinpoint and frame their attacks, often choosing to personally abuse the target in the process humiliate, intimidate and crush.Since they shout so loud, the lsquoCybernatsrsquo often succeed in getting the attention they crave, which in turn exaggerates how representative their views are within the Yes movement, thus turning off more moderate supporters and potential new recruits to the cause.Depressingly, thatrsquos why I think it will be so dficult for Messrs Robertson, McDonald and Smith to change anything. The attack dogs do so knowingly, in order to deliberately provoke attention, or are so far down the unthinking zealot road as to be beyond reach. What both have in common is that the more they insult, the easier it becomes.Such abuse has nothingto do with independence per se, but the damage for the wider Yes movement will be harder to disassociate.The appeal for nuance and persuasion comes at a time when both seem out of fashion, while extreme language pulses and trends through our discourse.Those of us looking for comfort should perhaps turn back to Dickens.

Labour needs to appear willing to negotiate, but wants the blame to lie firmly with the Prime Minister when talks fail.Coming to an agreement with Mrs May, even a good one, would make Mr Corbyn an accessory to Brexit. And itrsquos not at all clear that the Labour leadership actually wants another referendum. It has anyway been relegated to the status of a backstop against a ldquobad Tory Brexit. Shadow Cabinet figures like Diane Abbott believe a repeat referendum would probably result in another Leave vote. But Mr Corbyn is acutely aware that his legions of youthful fans in Momentum support a Peoplersquos Vote. So he tries to look both ways at once.This may be enough to get Labour through the European elections. Many Conservative constituency associations, and MPs like Boris Johnson, are refusing to campaign for these elections on the grounds that they should never have taken place.

Labour is not going to do particularly well either, but , by pursuing a policy of studied ambiguity, it can hold onto some Leave and some Remain voters, that will do nicely.But it wonrsquot be so nice for the rest of us. Mrs May has to go, even , as happened with Chamberlain, the successor is a isive character like Winston Churchill.

Our message [...] is that Scotland can prosper now. [hellip] There is absolutely nothing stopping us.

I dont believe that you are standing up for Scotland by flying to America and telling them that your country is being held back or by opening the curtains on a sunny day spending your time searching the horizon for a dark cloud and then blame Westminster for it.\"Indeed. It was high time that someone injected implicit confidence in the Scotland of the here and now.In contrast the SNP has governed the country for the past  years in the spirit that a devolved Scotland is somehow ldquonot normal and that a positive outlook requires ever more powers and, ultimately, separation.Had the devolved governments of the German Federal States adopted a similar approach of deliberate procrastination in , the Wirtschaftswunder of the s would never have happened. It can be done ndashyou want to.Regina Erich,Stonehaven.AS the SNP ratchets up the rhetoric for yet another independence referendum it was inevitable that the currency issue would rightly once more become the central part of the debate ndash unless, of course, you simply agree with Nicola Sturgeon that independence can somehow miraculously \"transcend\" the economy. For example, some SNP supporters have argued in these columns that as the Canadian dollar floats freely with the United States\"without any problems\", a Scottish currency should also work. However, what they fail to mention is that the Canadian dollar runs at around a  per cent discount to the US dollar, which would be similar to what we should expect against a pound sterling ndash especially when one factors in transaction costs. The knock-on effect on higher mortgages and borrowing costs would under these circumstances be extremely painful for all concerned.Others have claimed the pound was losing its attractiveness due to the UKs trade deficit in goods of pound billion as a reason for Sterlings decline but conveniently ignore the poundbn surplus on services in . Furthermore the overall deficitis entirely due to the trade with the EUand not with the rest of the world where we are in surplus and conduct most of our business under WTO-based rules.Finally, it seems strange that the SNP, which is now so desperate to be a full member of the EU, is already trying to distance itself from joining the euro at some time in the future when a key piece of the European lawstates that a new joining member would have to adopt the euro or find itself \"not fully compatible\".Small wonder the is are hopelessly split about the future direction of an independent Scottish currency when the wiser headsurge caution and the flag-waving members want to jump over the clf edge regardless of the economic consequences.Ian Lakin,Aberdeen AB.ALAN Stephenattacks your correspondent Kevin Mackennas remarks on Ruth Davidson where he wrote that she was back with the ldquosame stale old anti-independence but does not apply the same treatment to Nicola Sturgeon.Ms Sturgeons pro-independence principles have not changed, unlike Ms Davidson, who said two years ago that there was no reason for Theresa May to block a second independence referendum but now thinks she should.Opinions may change, but principles should not, unless she is a believer in Groucho Marx who stated: \"Themrsquos my principles, andyou donrsquot like them, I have others.Jim Lynch,Edinburgh EH.YOU quote a Conservative MP as saying that his party believes in ldquoOne nation values whereas the SNP does not . Surely he does not know the meaning of ldquoOne Nation Conservatism. It arose as a response to Disraelirsquos observation that there were two nations in Britain, the rich and the poor.

The online poll is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website www.orkney.gov.ukA shortlist has been drawn up by OIC Marine Services which features prominent figures from the county’s history, plus the name of a previous pilot launch:The design and build contract for the new -metre pilot vessel was secured after a competitive tendering exercise by Astilleros Armon S.A, which has its main base in Northern Spain.The vessel will join the two pilot launches currently operated by Marine Services. The naming ceremony is planned for September .Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “Like the celebrated explorer John Rae, some fitting names from Orkney’s past feature on the shortlist for the new vessel and I would encourage folk to take part in the poll.“With harbour business thriving in Orkney, this is an opportune time to replace an ageing pilot launch with a more modern, capable, and reliable vessel.

Like a letter from our past it not only tells us about the aspirations of our younger selves but forces us to reflect on whether we have lived up to our earlier ambitions as we mark this important milestone.‘Power For Change’, the document I found, was a comprehensive manesto for the change that the Scottish Trades Union Congress believed was necessary to be led by a Scottish Parliament. The clue was in the title. It was not constitutional change for its own sake, but for real change for the people of Scotland. It was written collectively and I contributed a number of chapters as the STUC’s newly appointed assistant secretary for economic affairs.Dusted off from the corner of my garage and reconsidered, it tells us a lot about why we are here today. The Scottish Parliament grew out of a process involving the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which itself was born out of the frustration of people in Scotland who knew thatpower could be held in the right hands at the right level, it could be used much more effectively for the benefit of the majority.The labour movement, industrially and politically, was deeply involved in developing that case. ‘Power For Change’ was the culmination of many years of such work by the trade unions, collectively, in Scotland. Building on earlier STUC pressure, this programme of reform argued for a strategy that “covers a wide sweep of areas crucial to the wellbeing and the development of the people of Scotland”.: Scottish Parliament at : How Holyrood found the power to make a dferenceNotably, it did not limit itself to talking about the powers that are required as an arid constitutional point, but instead placed those powers at the heart of delivering something dferent: “Central to this strategy has been the creation of a Scottish Parliament with powers to ensure that Scotland’s priorities are to the forefront when dealing with economic issues.”The late and much missed Campbell Christie was the General Secretary of the STUC at that time. He was determined to ensure that the focus remained on the purpose of a Scottish Parliament, not merely its fact. And so, in , Campbell initiated a comprehensive document for what the Scottish Parliament must do, designed to help shape the agenda of an incoming Neil Kinnock Labour government, and it was published in the weeks before the  general election. Labour lost, and we had to wait another five years for the election of a government that would finally deliver the Scottish Parliament that Power For Change so desperately wanted to see. Nonetheless, its vision and the arguments it contained remained a blueprint for progressive Scottish politics in the years leading up to the final establishment of the Parliament. It is not a factional point, but an historic fact, that during this whole time, the Tories implacably opposed the creation of a Scottish Parliament and the SNP walked out of the Constitutional Convention altogether. I am struck today by the all-encompassing, transformative vision that was held by those of us who fought for a Scottish Parliament, which is reflected in our ideas in Power For Change. Presciently, this vision demanded an energy policy for the st century that recognised the need to place the environment at its heart. On the economy, the agenda was to be radical. Recognising the role of financial services under a Scottish Parliament, Power For Change saw that the Parliament must provide for intervention in the economy – influencing mergers, safeguarding industry, and undertaking strategic economic planning. Manufacturing was seen as central to the wellbeing of the economy as a whole and an efficient modern transport infrastructure was understood to be essential for the economic growth Scotland needs. We also understood that Scotland would only be prosperousall of Scotland’s people could participate in its future and therefore that all forms of discrimination must be tackled. We saw that Parliament must see this objective as a priority. Education and skills were vital. Public services such as local government and the health service were to be revitalised and housing had to be addressed as a matter of urgency. : Queen to address MSPs at Holyrood to mark th anniversaryIt is instructive to remind ourselves of this all-embracing analysis of the state of Scottish economic and social conditions at the time when the Parliament was in gestation. Let us be honest with ourselves. Those conditions are fundamentally the same now. Some elements may be dferent in form but in content the conditions that made the creation of a Parliament necessary have just not gone away.Moreover, the early years of the Parliament certainly delivered real reform such as the scrapping of tuition fees, the introduction of free personal care and free bus travel for the over-s, the smoking ban and the repeal of clause a. But deep-seated change is now stalled. If anything, as I have argued here before, the big headline ‘change’ of constantly dragging everything back to independence, distracts from the actual change that could be delivered by a Scottish Parliament that drew strength and inspiration from the causes that led to its establishment in the first place.On this anniversary, there are tasks here for my party, and there are tasks for the Parliament. Labour delivered a Scottish Parliament and the next Scottish Labour Government will implement the most radical economic and social agenda in the history of devolution. To do that, my party must recapture and rededicate itself to the vision and hope of John Smith, Donald Dewar and all of those of us who campaigned for a Scottish Parliament. And for the Parliament, in recent years it has been distracted by constitutional debate rather than real action on the issues people care about and need, like jobs, schools and hospitals. The use of new powers over tax and social security has been too limited. While the wealth and incomes of the richest have soared in the past decade, one in four children are growing up in poverty. Twenty years on, that once again must be what drives us to use that power for change.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove unveils plans to take control of holyrood cash","story":"Radical plans to hold back tens of millions of pounds from Holyrood and allow UK ministers instead to spend the cash directly north of the Border have been set out by environment secretary Michael Gove.The Scots-born MP is among the front-runners to replace Theresa May when she stands down.He insists his plan for Westminster to be allowed to spend Treasury funding in traditionally devolved areas would strengthen the Union.It could see Westminster funding projects in areas such as education and farming.The plan would also tackle unrest at Westminster over the Scottish Government’s claim that it alone “speaks for Scotland”.“There’s a rule that we’re currently bound by, a Treasury rule which means that the UK Government can’t spend money in areas that are devolved,” Mr Gove told a fringe event at the Tory conference yesterday.“So that means when it comes to promoting culture or supporting agriculture and fisheries, the money has to go through the Scottish Government.“I think that once we’ve given the Scottish Government their fair share, the UK Government should be able to spend additional money on the basis of need for projects that will strengthen the Union.” Mr Gove said every government department thinks of itself as a UK department.Speaking during a question-and-answer session with Stirling MP Stephen Kerr, Mr Gove also hinted UK ministers could start spending in devolved areas.“The department of education deals primarily with schools in England, but actually the strength of our knowledge base across the United Kingdom matters. “There are English students in Scottish Universities and there are Scottish academics in English Universities- we need to make sure that the money that we spend and the initiatives that we carry out here are badged as UK Government.“The Scottish Government is very good at using money that it gets form Westminster to claim it is delivering them - actually it is the UK Government that is providing this and leading the way on budgets.”He hinted that more Scottish MPs would be handed ministerial roleshe replaces Theresa May“We shouldmake sure the Westminster government is seen as representative of every part of the United Kingdom and we’re prepared to energetically say to the SNP ‘You don’t speak for Scotland.’”“The whole idea that you say you are the Scottish Government and therefore you are the only legitimate voice that speaks for Scotland is wrong.“Of course we respect the devolution settlement and we respect their capacity to make policy as long they have a majority.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing. Otherwise it will be a drop in the Minch."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/barra-airport-1.jpg","title":"new flight bank to give barra community more","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCreating a bank of  flights between Barra and Glasgow which can be used by the community at busy times of the year has been welcomed by the chairman of Castlebay Community Council.Michael Galbraith said the announcement, made last in late April by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, was all about giving locals #more control# over the number of flights rather than having them dictated by Loganair.#If there is a wedding or an event like Barrathon then we could well need the extra flights and we can pass that request on to Loganair,# he added. #First of all it will go through the chairs of Castlebay and Northbay community councils and we will disseminate that request to the other members.

In three months, I’ve put nearly £ into the heating. The guy that came out to look at it said that I was pumping money into nothing.

We were a support network for each other really.“I knew everything was going well for her le. Her partner Sara meant I never had to worry about Lyra. Everything was in place for her and it is really bad her le has been ended so quickly.”Conall was contacted after the vigil by Susan Curran, who came up with the idea of the walk.“The idea came about quite spontaneously the night after Lyra’s killing in a conversation I had with Conall,” she said.“Conall had organised the vigil but I was late in work that night and really gutted that I missed it. “The idea came in my head of a walk from Belfast to Derry. I just said to Conall let’s do it!“I was just overcome with anger about what happened and fear that we were going back to that.“We are just a group of people who want to react and take action. I have legs, a voice and a heart and that is all I need for the walk.“Everyone can take part in the walk in any way they can. We would ask people to challenge themselves. We are asking people to ‘Be more Lyra’.“Our message to people who don’t support us is for them to be honest with themselves and realise the majority of people who signed up to the Good Friday Agreement.“We don’t want any more young people in graves or swayed by violence. We want Lyra’s death to be the last Troubles-related death in our society.“Through the walk, we want to demonstrate the will of the majority of people in our society to reject violence as a means to resolving our issues.“We want to rejuvenate and bring new le into the principles of the Good Friday Agreement which has been broken time and time again. As ordinary people in society, we are fully behind it.“We have very real memories of the Troubles and we don’t want a repeat for our children and our children’s children.“We believe Lyra’s death will be a catalyst for change. This is our generation’s peace walk.”The walk will leave Writer’s Square in Belfast at am on Saturday, May  to walk the  miles to Moneymick in Randalstown for the first camp.On Sunday , walkers will depart at am to walk  miles to Dungiven for the second stop over before completing the last  miles on Mondayto Guildhall in Derry.Brenda Gough is encouraging people to get involved in whatever way they can.“Over  people have registered.

That means that  per cent of the most affordable homes are no longer available in West Belfast.”Cllr Corr continued: “The reality for us and for many many people in West Belfast who are looking for a home is the massive dference in rents between the Housing Executive houses and housing association houses,” he said.Cllr Corr said he has had numerous tenants seeking advice over their current housing association rents and that the monetary dference between that and a Housing Executive tenancy agreement could be between £ and £ per week.“Rents are decided by a housing association board, whose homes are part-funded by the Department for Communitiesbut who also need to repay loans taken out for house construction, while the Housing Executive is a totally dferent set up.“What you are finding is that housing associations are pricing out working families, especially people on low paid income who cannot afford their rents.“People are stuck. In extreme cases people have had to give up their tenancies and go back to live with their parents in what is now being referred to as the ‘boomerang generation’.“We need a radical overhaul, to increase massively the amount of affordable housing, and we need to have housing-led regeneration for many disadvantaged areas.“People who are working are forced into private rental as they can’t get a mortgage. If you can’t get a mortgage in West Belfast you are forced to look to Glenavy, Crumlin or Lisburn. People are having to leave their family support network, which in turn puts more pressure on those trying to access childcare and schools.

The play tells of the journey of two Belfast women set against the backdrop of the crumbling Floral Hall as they recall the fateful night they met their future musician husbands. Old grudges and sparks fly as they reminisce about the lestyles of their globetrotting other halves who experienced fame and fortune while the wives they left behind struggled to bring up their young families, working all day and spending countless lonely nights. Written and directed by Brenda Winter-Palmer, the production has been developed by West Belfast actress Antoinette Morelli, daughter of showband legend Tony. Inbetween a quick rehearsal break, Antoinette spoke passionately to the Andersonstown News about how she has haboured the project for the past  years and how proud she is to see it come to fruition on The MAC stage next week. “I’m in a wee bit of shock and obviously incredibly excited that it’s got to this stage,” she said. “Brenda had heard my story about daddy and it turned out that Brenda’s daddy was Micky Conlon, a big concert promoter at that time. I commissioned Brenda three years ago to write the piece.“We had a read through last year in the Strand cinema as part of the Eastside Arts festival. David Hull the promoter was invited, he picked it up and this is where we are.”Antoinette plays the character of Rose, “a character that has been inspired by mum’s stories but is not my mum”. “The story is fictionalised and it’s about two couples, two sisters and the impact the showbands have on their lives,” she said. Antoinette continued: “With the Miami Showband story out this year and this production the stories are similar in terms of the showband connection but this is very much from the women’s perspective. “It’s tragic, it’s funny, there are a lot of good treats in there with music from the showband era. The universal heartbeat of the play is our story, the sacrices women made to let their men go off and pursue their dreams. “The Floral Hall is almost its own character in the play, after last year’s reading we had so many people come up to say ‘oh we met there’, people have such good memories of the place.“I know how dficult it is now, in terms of performing, first hand, as my husband is a stay-at-home dad to our -year-old and -month-old. If it wasn’t for him doing that I couldn’t pursue my career so I’m lucky that is he very supportive. I definitely think people will identy with the show.”Keep Telling Me Lies will be performed at The MAC theatre from Thursday May  until Sunday May .

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

READ here: https:t.co WPuNVMdjXW— Northern Ireland OfficeMay , The process will involve agenda-setting and stock-taking meetings between the five leaders and two governments at least once a week, with five working groups set up to focus on the detail of key disputes at the heart of the deadlock.The tone of Tuesday’s preliminary meeting was understood to be more harmonious than the last gathering of the party leaders in the winter.LIVE: DUP Stormont talks updatePosted by Belfast  on Tuesday, May , Afterwards, DUP leader Arlene Foster said she would enter the talks with a “good heart” and with determination to find a solution.“We want devolution to work because we are a devolutionist party,” she said.“From our part I was very clear with all the other parties that we will not be found wanting in getting a deal to get Stormont up and running again.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Arlene Foster “We are entering this talks process to find a way forward. It has to, of course, be a balanced way forward and one that everyone in Northern Ireland is comfortable with, whether they are unionist, nationalist or indeed other – and I think that’s very important.“We are not looking at the prospect of failure – we want this to work.”The last DUP Sinn Fein-led powersharing coalition imploded in January  when the late Martin McGuinness quit as Sinn Fein deputy first minister amid a row about a botched green energy scheme.The fallout over the Renewable Heat Incentivewas soon overtaken by disputes over the Irish language, the region’s ban on same-sex marriage and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.Six previous talks initiatives to restore devolution have failed to find consensus.Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ready to “do the business”.Text from the multiparty talks to restore the Northern Ireland Executive. READ here: https:t.co WPuNVMdjXW— Northern Ireland OfficeMay , “The current stalemate is not acceptable and not sustainable, there are outstanding issues that need to be resolved, and we believe they can be resolved,” she said.“If everybody is prepared to show leadership,everybody is prepared to respect the clear public desire for equality and people’s rights to be recognised and delivered on, we can find our way back to powersharing.”After the meeting, Mrs Bradley said: “None of us should be under any illusions about this.“There are some very signicant challenges and this is not going to be easy, and therefore I’d ask that we all give the parties time and space to allow them to address these dficult issues and to come to the right conclusion for the people of Northern Ireland, which is the restoration of devolution.”She said she would not be making any further public comment on the talks during the process.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Karen Bradley Mr Coveney described the first meeting as constructive and positive.“All of the parties and their political leaders were very constructive for the initial meeting today, but clearly we’ve a lot of work to do,” he said.“Everybody recognises that there is work to do to accommodate each other but certainly I think today was as constructive and positive a start as we could have hoped for.”Doubts have been raised whether parties will be prepared to compromise during the European election campaign.Mr Coveney insisted progress could be made ahead of the election, although he acknowledged a final resolution may not emerge until after the poll.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Simon Coveney Efforts to resurrect the devolved institutions have been injected with fresh urgency following the dissident republican murder of journalist Lyra McKee in Londonderry last month.Politicians are facing mounting public pressure to find consensus amid concerns that violent extremists are exploiting the power vacuum.Last week’s local council elections recorded a surge in support for middle ground parties such as Alliance, with many interpreting the result as a sign of growing disaffection at the polarised Stormont stand-off.While the DUP and Sinn Fein failed to make the gains at council level that some predicted, they remain the region’s two pre-eminent political forces and the fate of the Stormont talks is still in their hands.The last talks process broke down in acrimony last February with claim and counter-claim on what had been agreed.Sinn Fein said DUP leader Arlene Foster had agreed a draft deal to re-enter devolved government that included concessions on the Irish language – a claim Mrs Foster denied.Many of the disputes are linked to a controversial voting mechanism that enables blocs of unionists and nationalists to veto measures which command overall majority support in the Assembly.A number of the smaller parties are calling for changes to the contentious petition of concern, believing its reform could unlock several logjams at the heart of Stormont’s impasse.With the UK Government reluctant to reintroduce direct rule from Westminster, Northern Ireland has operated in a political limbo for the last two years, with senior civil servants being left to run public services.The civil servants are seriously hamstrung, unable to make key policy decisions in the absence of elected ministers.As a consequence, numerous governmental decisions are in abeyance, with many major policy initiatives in cold storage."},{"url":null,"title":"government gives green light to 3bn euro national","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is expected to take seven years to complete.The Taoiseach said the project was about connecting Ireland to the rest of the world.“When it comes to connecting our people to the world we must pay the price of progress now or we risk staying trapped in the past forever,” Mr Varadkar said.“It’s about making sure this time rural Ireland isn’t left behind.

Three were selected as preferred bidders but two pulled out, leaving one consortium in the running.Last October, former communications minister Denis Naughten stepped down amid controversy over the rural broadband plan after it came to light that he held previously undisclosed meetings with the head of the last remaining bidder.An independent review was commissioned by the Taoiseach following concerns about the procurement process, but it found it had not been influenced by Mr Naughten or businessman David McCourt, who is part of Granahan McCourt.The cost of the project was originally estimated at between  million and  million euro, but last month Mr Varadkar confirmed the cost would end up being closer to  billion euro.He maintained that the original cost estimate of  million euro was for a very dferent project."},{"url":null,"title":"heres how twitter reacted to liverpools sensational victory over barca","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Cllr Curran said space in an existing refrigeration unit is exhausted and more is required.Meanwhile, former South Down MP, Margaret Ritchie, who recently visited Ardglass, is also pleased that local fishermen can now fish in Dundalk Bay.She thanked the Minister for Fisheries and Marine in Dublin, political colleagues in Daacuteil Eacuteireann and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood for making representations to ensure legislation was enacted.She added: ldquoThis will ensure that fishing, which is the leblood of the Ardglass community, can continue unhindered. This is also good news for the local economy.Development plans for Ardglass include relocating Ardglass trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the village harbour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Artist chosen to display work at renowned exhibition in Dublin  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK artist who is the youngest ever member of the Ulster Water Colour Society is to exhibit in Irelandrsquos biggest and most prestigious art exhibition next month.Connor Maguire has recently been selected to show his self-portrait entitled lsquoMan in the Hatrsquo at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin. It will be the second time he has been chosen to exhibit along with Irelandrsquos finest artists.The  year-old mdash who is a former De La Salle High student mdash says his painting is a side profile piece which was completed in oils on canvas. Out of a total of , entries submitted to the exhibition, only  or so are successful.Connor was shortlisted last year for the Zurich Portrait prize where he was only one of  artists throughout Ireland to be up for a winning prize of two thousand euros.This gave him the opportunity to exhibit in the National Gallery of Ireland which he describes as being ldquosurreal and a dream come true.Connor said: ldquoOne of my earliest memories is of me scribbling away at a table with my grandfather, Broderick Maguire.ldquoMy grandfather, an accomplished draughtsman, carpenter, designer and painter, could do anything that he applied himself to and introduced me to pencil drawing and charcoal. He inspired and captivated me, seeing what he could accomplish with a pencil and a paintbrush. I attempted to paint as good as he did and believe Irsquom still trying.Connor continued: ldquoI recall my art teacher at high school, Mr McLaughlin, was a terric influence on me too. It was one of the few classes I actually enjoyed.ldquoAfter A-Levels, I took up art at the University of Ulster and have been painting non-stop since. I won the Chairmanrsquos Award in , and have went on to win the Stephens Award, Anna Cheyne Award and Carnathan Galleries Award.ldquoI work three days a week at the Assumption Grammar as an art technician. I work with the students, helping them explore print making and they seem to love it.Connor also works steadily as a freelance artist, specialising in painting from watercolours to oils, printmaking in the form of woodcuts, linocuts, drawings in charcoal and graphite exhibiting, and in case he might have a spare moment or two, he is a professional picture framer too.Most of Connorrsquos paintings are inspired by themes of portraiture and he has a keen eye for figure and character in familiar settings like a simple family meal. He takes inspiration form the essence of someone which he can capture through some serious study.Taking part in the exhibition, which is now in its th year, is another stepping block to Connor gaining recognition on the international stage where interest has been coming from American art curator, Didi Menendez and the RJD Gallery in New York.Both notable art critics and buyers who he has been in contact with could well result in him exhibiting further afield.Connor has also took part in BBC Radio  programmes talking about his work with broadcasting journalists, Perminder Khatkar and Helen Marks.Last year he featured on BBC rsquos lsquoThe Arts Showrsquo talking about his work with Marie Louise Muir.He says it was a ldquocool feeling to be featured alongside actor Ciaran Hynds who was featured in the same programme.Connor was shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  in association with Artists  Illustrators Magazine, exhibiting in Londonrsquos prestigious Mall Galleries alongside some of Britainrsquos greatest artists.He was also shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  with the same magazine. winning the West Dean College Award exhibiting again in the Mall Galleries in London.This RHA exhibition will catapult Connor further than he can imagine and said hersquod like to concentrate on portraiture and introduce more figures into the paintings on the theme of realism and experiment on learning new things in printmaking with woodcuts and etching.More of Connorrsquos work can be viewed on his website www.connormaguire..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Bid to boost tourism in Downpatrick area  ","story":"MORE emphasis on tourism promotion across Downpatrick and Lecale has the potential to signicantly enhance the districtrsquos economy, according to a UUP candidate in tomorrowrsquos local council election.Alexander Burgess, who is contesting one of the five seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick DEA, believes more needs to be done to make the most of the arearsquos unique link with St Patrick.Mr Burgess, who was recently joined by his party leader, Robin Swann, on a visit to the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint in Downpatrick, is confident that furthering St Patrickrsquos links with Downpatrick and wider Lecale can help promote new business opportunities, including hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.He is also delighted that planning permission was recently secured for a major new hotel at the site of the former Abbey Lodge development at the Belfast Road on the outskirts of the town.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one economic driver and we are blessed with so many fantastic places to visit in Downpatrick and across the wider district, said Mr Burgess.ldquoMany areas would give all they had to have such an important link with St Patrick. Downpatrick boasts Irelandrsquos only centre dedicated to him but I believe more needs to be done to fully exploit the tourism potential the patron saint offers us.Mr Burgess said additional overnight accommodation in Downpatrick and Lecale was crucial to assisting any new drive to encourage more people to visit and learn about Patrick and the arearsquos rich Patrician heritage.He said having spoken to many people during his election canvass, it is clear there is simply not enough tourism accommodation at present.ldquoIt is rather ironic that while Newry, Mourne and Down Council has quite rightly put tourism at the top of its agenda, there is simply not enough accommodation for people to stay. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, continued Mr Burgess.ldquoThere are already thousands of people visiting the St Patrick Centre every year and how great it would bethere were more places for them to stay to fully exploit what the area has to offer. We already have the Ballydugan Mill hotel on the outskirts of the town and a number of bed and breakfast providers, but we need to capitalise on the lucrative overnight market by providing more bed spaces.Mr Burgess said he hopes that when day-trip tour operators arrange visits to the St Patrick Centre that they will allow additional time for tourists to visit town centre shops, cafes and restaurants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Burgess calls for new centre to be opened  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to open Saintfieldrsquos new community centre immediately.The call has been issued by Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, who is concerned that weeks after work on the eagerly-anticipated Belfast Road centre was completed, the entrance gates remain locked and the ultra-modern facility lies unused.On the eve of tomorrowrsquos local government election, the Recorder understands that while several opening dates were suggested, agreement could not be reached between the ious parties and that the new centre is not expected to open until the end of this month or early June at the earliest.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on May  and it is understood that the new centre will not open before then.A local authority spokesman said as the organisation is currently operating under the restrictions of purdah mdash imposed in the lead-up to an election and which restricts councils from making major announcements ndash the opening will not take place until after the local government poll.Cllr Burgess insists he sees no reason why the centre was not opened before now.ldquoIt is my understanding having spoken to senior council officials that all the work has been completed and it is simply a case of opening the centre. I have also been told that the centre could have opened in February. We are now in May and the entrance gates remain locked. This simply isnrsquot on, he declared.ldquoThe delay in opening a centre which the people of Saintfield helped deliver is inexcusable in my book. Over poundm has been invested in the project and while building work has been completed, the cross-community facility remains closed.Cllr Burgess said there was ample time to arrange the official opening of the centre before purdah kicked in and ahead of tomorrowrsquos election.ldquoWhen the council finally gets around to opening a centre which it has allowed to remain closed for several months, it is essential that it invites all those associated with the project, in particular, those involved with the proposal from the outset.ldquoA lot of people have invested considerable time and effort in this project and it is vital their collective efforts are recognised at the official opening.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoThe people of Saintfield and indeed further afield are perplexed as to why the centre has not opened. Perhaps after purdah ends, Newry, Mourne and Down Council will tell the districtrsquos ratepayers why there has been such an extraordinarily y and, in my opinion, totally unnecessary delay.A local authority spokesman confirmed that no date has yet been agreed for the official opening of the new community centre in Saintfield.He added: As the Council is now operating under the restrictions of lsquopurdahrsquo the centre will not open until after the local council elections have taken place..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch by pass  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a start on work on Ballynahinchrsquos new poundm by-pass.It comes just days after major gridlock on the main approach roads to the market town over the Easter holiday period in Ballynahinch which is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular.Roads officials say they are keen to get on with the job of building the near two-mile by-pass linking the Belfast and Newcastle roads, with Rowallane Ulster Unionist candidate, Walter Lyons, insisting this must happen now.As part of the multi-million project, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road in Ballynahinch.Mr Lyons said the by-pass must be delivered not only to ease town centre gridlock in Ballynahinch, but to encourage new investment and attract more visitors to the area.ldquoThere is no doubt that traffic congestion in the town centre is an impediment to new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and it must be so frustrating for people from Belfast and other areas who have to make their way through the town during bank and public holidays and over the summer to sit in long tailbacks, he said.Mr Lyons, who was recently joined by UUP leader Robin Swann who was visiting the town, said the campaign for the townrsquos by-pass started  years ago and that the scheme must now be delivered.ldquoMoney has been made available for other major road schemes in Northern Ireland while Ballynahinch continues to wait, he declared. ldquoThe congestion in the town centre was as bad as it has been for many years on Easter Monday and we need to address the issue.ldquoIt is clear that the congestion problem is not only impacting on investment in the town but local tourism. My fear is that people will not want to come to our districtthey are continually caught in traffic snarl-ups.Mr Lyons said log-jammed streets could also impact on the ability of the emergency services to respond to major incidents, should one arise.He added: ldquoCongestion in Ballynahinch impacts on a much wider area yet progress on delivering the much-needed by-pass is painfully slow. It is my understanding that the project cannot move to the procurement and construction stages until the necessary funding is available. This needs to happen.ldquoWe need a financial commitment to build the road to benefit the entire district. The congestion is not solely a Ballynahinch problem but,solved, has the capacity to provide major benefits. We have been told that the scheme is shovel ready so letrsquos get on with the job of building the road.Mr Lyons said thatelected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, delivering the scheme will be one of his key priorities.

completing work on an environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street in Downpatrick has been branded a ldquodisgrace by a local politician.Councillor Dermot Curran has this week called for an urgent meeting to be arranged between traders and senior officials from a number of government departments involved in the project to discuss what went wrong and what can be done to ensure the project is completed as soon as possible.Last week the Recorder revealed that Irish Street traders are furious that work on the project is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned.Work to provide new paving, street lighting and street furniture was due to complete at the end of March, but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced, taking the scheme into July.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have also arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base and problems with the sewer network.Cllr Curran wants senior representatives from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities to meet with traders and insists that NI Water must also be represented.ldquoThe public realm scheme has been delayed by over three months, raw sewage has been running down the street and, most shockingly, traders have not been kept abreast of the reasons for the delay, he declared.ldquoThe Irish Street project was due to complete inside three months but it will now be early July and what those responsible for the work do not realise is that businesses are being affected across the town, not just those in Irish Street.Cllr Curran said the delay in completing the scheme is having a major impact on the town centre, revealing that he has heard reports that the number of people using the Irish Street car park has reduced since work on the public realm scheme started.He said with trading conditions dficult enough at the best of times, the last thing business owners need is for the one-way system remaining in place in Irish Street for another two months.ldquoThe delay in completing this scheme is nothing short of disgraceful and questions need answered. In addition, traders should be provided with weekly progress briefings as a matter of courtesy. The fact this has not happened is deeply disappointing, Cllr Curran continued.The local politician said the temporary one-way system is impacting on traffic volumes in St Patrickrsquos Avenue and Market Street in particular, with some shoppers opting to avoid Downpatrick as work on the public realm scheme continues.Cllr Curran also suggested that the delay in delivering the public realm scheme would ldquosimply not be tolerated in any other area. He claimed that taking twice as long to complete a scheme would not be accepted in areas like Newry, Lisburn or Belfast.He declared: ldquoMany businesses in Downpatrick are suffering as the result of an unacceptable delay. The clear evenings are now here, so why canrsquot contractors be asked to work longer to complete the scheme sooner ldquoWhile I accept that the delays may be the result of unexpected circumstances, surely the trick is to come up with imaginative solutions to get the work completed as soon as possible  The suggested completion date at the end of June needs to be reassessed now.Cllr Curran said he plans to contact the ious government departments and agencies to arrange a meeting with Irish Street traders and hopes it will take place as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle park needs management strategy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council officials have been asked to develop a management strategy for an open area at the rear of Newcastlersquos Donard Park and adjacent woodland.The request has been made by Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who recently tabled a council motion urging the local authority to contact the Annesley Estate with a view to leasing land it owns at this part of the town.Cllr Clarke is keen for this to happen to enable the council to maintain what he described as an ldquoattractive area to complement existing amenities in Donard Park.He believes the council can help play a key role in improving the recreational, health and well-being of local people, in tandem with enhancing the resortrsquos tourism potential,the area and its important habitat are managed properly.While his recent motion was referred to the local authorityrsquos Economic Regeneration and Tourism Committee for debate, Cllr Clarke said that,re-elected, one of his key priorities will be shaping the future management of a ldquo fabulous landscape and woodland, preserving it for future generations.He continued: ldquoThe upper green area needs to be incorporated in the future management of Donard Wood, while the pathways and signage for visitors need to be improved for visitors entering the main route used by hill walkers heading into the Mournes to climb Slieve Donard.ldquoIn the short term, I have made representations to council officials to carry out maintenance improvements at the Shanslieve Drive entrance to Donard Park where visitors are greeted by rusting litter bins, council signage dating back to the s and a potholed surface.Cllr Clarke said these are improvements that need to carried out immediately.Also this week, he has called on the local authority to repaint the historic archway at the entrance to Donard Park car park.He said: ldquoRepainting the archway will also improve the appearance and aesthetics of the entrance into Donard Park and I have requested that the work is undertaken as quickly as possible, Cllr Clarke added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle rock star’s intimate solo album  ","story":"THE discovery of a random white feather gave The Answerrsquos frontman Cormac Neeson a sign of hope at the most desperate time in his le mdash and the inspiration for his first solo album.The Newcastle rocker has just released a searingly intimate and personal album called White Feather with ten tracks which deal with his eldest son Dabhoacutegrsquos fight to be born and for le itself.Launching at Belfast venue The Black Box on May , the  year-old will give his most stripped back performance as an artist as he tours with the album over the coming months.His old friends, The Unholy Gospel Band, with bass guitarist, Downpatrickrsquos own Eamon Hanlon, will be joining him for the big night.Cormac also has a new single out from the album, Broken Wing, a country-inspired track with blues backing choir that will resonate with people whether they are a parent or not.His rock vocals have given way to a deeper, introspective sound that is still etched with emotion.The  year-old singer, who once toured with rock legends AD DC, says he the experience of nearly losing his son from being born prematurely at  weeks has changed him.Dabhoacuteg, who has Downrsquos Syndrome, weighed only lb oz when he was born. After spending his first four months in a hospital neo-natal unit and undergoing heart surgery on his first birthday, he is now four. Thankfully, Dabhoacuteg has turned the corner despite overcoming serious medical obstacles in his short le.Dabhoacuteg and his  month-old brother, Conall, mean everything to Cormac and his we Louise, who now live in Belfast.ldquoWhenever you have a sick child and you go through an ordeal like that with your family, it does definitely alter your perception and you come out the other side of it changed, said Cormac.ldquoYou just look at le in a dferent way. You appreciate stuff that you never appreciated because yoursquore not sitting in an intensive care unit in the Royal [Victoria Hospital]. Anything is better than that.The couple only had a few weeks to privately celebrate getting pregnant with their first child when Louise had to be rushed into hospital.They initially were advised that pregnancy was lost as it was so early but were told to come back to hospital in a few weeks time.ldquoIt was the longest two weeks in my le, recalls Cormac. ldquoThe night before we were due to go the hospital I went out for a walk in the Mournes. I was a bit raging at the world and screaming up to the heavens asking to be give a sign that everything was going to be ok.ldquoI was literally stopped dead in my tracks with this little splash of white high in a tree. I climbed up into the tree to see what it was and it was a white feather.ldquoI had always been brought up to believe that white feathers symbolised new le. I couldnrsquot believe that I spotted it at that time and brought it back down. I had a feeling then that everything was ok. The next day we went to hospital and sure enough there was this tiny mustard seed on the scan with the most giant heartbeat you ever saw in your le. It was the beginning of what was to be a most tumultuous journey and the beginning of where we are now, having an amazing four-year-old and a baby.ldquoDabhoacuteg really is a warrior. Hersquos been through more than me and most people ever will in their lives.Long-term fans of The Answer may be surprised at one of their leaders heading to Nashville to write and record the album.But as Cormac tells it, itrsquos just the way it was meant to be.He went to the home of country music in  on a songwriting course to help write songs for other artists but ended up literally pouring his heart and pain out in the songs mdash in time-honoured country music fashion.ldquoItrsquos not a country record but you can tell it is recorded in Nashville, said Cormac.ldquoThere is an awful lot of soul to it and a bit of subtley to it as well as it allowed me to express myself in the way that I needed to at this point in my le. I needed to make a record that reflected that switch in the way I see le.The Nashville approach to writing songs was a more reflective experience for Cormac that what he is used to with bandmates Paul Mahon, Mickey Waters and James Heatley.ldquoIt was just a completely dferent approach to songwriting that I had been used to doing for  years with The Answer, said Cormac. ldquoItrsquos a hard rocking blues band and a lot of our songs are written with the volume pedal turned up rfing away, having a good time and letting songs organically develop.ldquoIn Nashville, you sit in a room with two other people and an accustic guitar and you have a long conversation about your le and what you might want to write about. I found once we were locked into the message we wanted to put across in the song everything  fell into place. We basically wrote songs in the morning and recorded in the afternoon as thatrsquos what the studio expected.ldquoA lot of what Irsquom singing about on this record just would not work on a record from The Answer because it wouldnrsquot be appropriate. Rock and roll is loud and le-affirming. While a lot of these songs are le-affirming, they are in a completely dferent way.Cormac assures the bandrsquos devoted following that they have stockpiled a supply of new songs and will be coming out with a new album.Addressing his own personal hiatus, Cormac added: ldquoIrsquom still the same guy I was in The Answer and will be again when The Answer makes our next record. I just needed to get into the right room with the right writers making the right music.White Feather album will be released on April  before a tour kicks off in the UK on May  for a run of seven support shows followed by six Irish headline dates.

Sands struck with all the stealth and power that her dad Noel displayed for Down hurlers for many years as she beat Katie Smith all ends up with a clinical finish.Meath were now on the ropes and Sands delivered a second knock-out blow a minute later when she again ghosted in to direct a McCartan pass to the net and give down a - to - interval lead.Meath had the wind advantage after the break, but it was Down and the unrelenting McCartan who took centre stage.Two sensational points from the Castlewellan teenager, a daughter of former Down All-Ireland medal winner Greg in , stretched Downrsquos lead to seven points with only five minutes of the second half played.All credit to Meath, they steadfastly refused to throw in the towel and a Foley point left them trailing - to - after  minutes.It wax at this stage that Savage played a real captainrsquos role from her central half back role. She was simply imperious, plucking the sliotar out of the air and then sending it forward for her team-mates to chase.Meath went close to giving Down a fright in the rd minute when an explosive shot from Fagan rattled off the crossbar and was cleared to safety, but other than that, little got past Savage.McCartan and Leonard swapped points as the game drew to a close, but Down had no intention of relinquishing their grip on the game and refused to give Meath any more scores.Down: Niamh Sharkey, Orlaith OrsquoRourke, Hannah Toner, Alice Coulter, Isabella OrsquoHare, Blanaid Savage, Niamh Dempster, Megan OrsquoBoyle, Anna McKee, Cerys Clarke, Sorcha McCartan , Saoirse Sands , Gerra McGrattan, Aoibhinn Brentnall , Beth Fitzpatrick.

This senseless vandalism has to stop and stop now, he declared.ldquoThe play equipment was specically designed for small children and it is my understanding that the names of people who were spotted in the vicinity of the playground when it was vandalised have been handed over to the authorities.Mr Teggart said Crossgar was a village proud of its mixed community with people getting on well together and working in unison to make it a welcoming and vibrant place.ldquoWe all get along with each other but it would appear that there are several youths who are determined to cause harm and have no respect for anyone or indeed young childrenrsquos play equipment, he continued.Mr Teggart added: ldquoWestlands residents are rightly upset with one suggesting to me that whoever was responsible should be made to pay for the damage they have caused.Cllr Andrews said this ldquowanton act of vandalism was totally out of order and uncalled for, emphasising that it was children who suffered as a result of the ldquodespicable action of others.ldquoI have made local council officials aware of what happened and and hope that the damaged equipment can be replaced.

I detect a complete detachment between the leadership and the grassroots supporters, indeed a disregard when we hear comments from iniduals such as Gavin Robinson MP. There is a massive opposition to what the DUP have done and maybe it will be more clearly seen in the European elections where there is is a viable TUV alternative available for all areas. Meanwhile, it seems that the DUP are now taking aim at Jim Wells, who was brave enough to speak up. “Unseemly comments,” apparently. I suggest the DUP leadership read Romans : to see what is unseemly! Jim is renowned for his hard work among his constituents and is extremely popular. There are those who would be very keen to bring Jim’s  year DUP tenure to an end. They maybe don’t realise they have also finished people like myself voting for the party again.

It has to, of course, be a balanced way forward and one that everyone in Northern Ireland is comfortable with, whether they are unionist, nationalist or indeed other – and I think that’s very important.“We are not looking at the prospect of failure – we want this to work.”Six previous talks initiatives to restore devolution have failed to find consensus.Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ready to “do the business”.Seamus Close: ‘My father was a softie at heart and was at peace in his final days’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The current stalemate is not acceptable and not sustainable, there are outstanding issues that need to be resolved, and we believe they can be resolved,” she said.After the meeting, Mrs Bradley said: “None of us should be under any illusions about this.“There are some very signicant challenges and this is not going to be easy, and therefore I’d ask that we all give the parties time and space to allow them to address these dficult issues and to come to the right conclusion for the people of Northern Ireland, which is the restoration of devolution.”She said she would not be making any further public comment on the talks during the process.Mr Coveney described the first meeting as constructive and positive.try catch  TrendingWoman and dog hit by car on NI roadN.I. local elections -

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful. In the law it doesnrsquot state what you have to use to pick up the dog fouling. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth. Irsquove visited the factory literally hundreds of times in the last three years and that wouldnrsquot have been possibleit was made in China, but what it proves more than anything is that businessmen and women really need to look thoroughly at whatrsquos under their noses.ldquoIrsquove been amazed by the talent Irsquove seen on these shores - there are some incredible businesses here doing some world beating things, and they need our support. Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

outcome was pre-determined. “I am saddened that the wishes of those whose children will be affected the most have been discarded without a thought and that the support they should have received from public representatives simply did not materialise.“This consultation process is now subject to a Judicial Review following a complaint from one of the pupils affected and has been granted legal aid.”He added: “I am confident it will show that the process was flawed and that a true Lurgan solution was never truly considered.“In the meantime I will continue to speak up for the community who will now be left wondering why they are being treated in such an uncaring manner and why their voices are being ignored.”The EA launched an eight week consultation exercise on the future of the Lurgan campus of the school in January which brought a heated debate across Lurgan.Opinions were ided among those who supported the EA plan to consolidate the two campuses of the school in Portadown and those who wanted to see a ‘Lurgan solution, specically an - school at the Lurgan Junior High School site.The consultation closed in March.

He would prefer to be the only dog in the house and could live with older children.”Entry is £ per adult and children are free but encouraged to donate one tin of dog food.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .
