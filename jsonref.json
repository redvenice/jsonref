What was her first choice? A jacket that says, \u0027Womp, womp?\u0027\u0027 added Colbert, referring to a comment from Trump\u0027s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who callously mocked an immigrant girl, 10, with Down syndrome who was separated from her mother at the border. Melania\u0027s spokeswoman emphatically claimed after the media furor, that Melania hadn\u0027t been trying to send any message with her \u0027jacket seen round the world.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s just a jacket. ... There was no hidden message,\u0027 the said. The claim  was immediately undermined by the president who tweeted that it had beena commentary on the \u0027Fake News Media.\u0027Colbert said he agreed with one point, the message is \u0027definitely not hidden.\u0027  \u0027It\u0027s right on the back.

I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll have the same reaction to this,\u0027 he added.Indeed, that happened. The right also lost its mind when President Obama wore a tan suit, with one Republican lawmaker even claiming that the choice of clothing put national security at risk.

The three double bedrooms all have small balconies, and there are two bathrooms.The villas are part of a complex with three outdoor swimming pools, some with water slides, as well as basketball, volleyball and tennis courts, plus 24-hour site security.Julian Walker, of Spot Blue, says that Turkey is proving particularly good value for British holidaymakers because of the favourable currency rate between the pound and Turkish lira. He also points to the area around Bodrum becoming more accessible as Turkish Airlines has launched a new summer Gatwick to Bodrum route, running every Wednesday and Saturday until September 8.Across the Mediterranean, the property market in Ibiza is booming. Entry prices for villas, fincas and apartments in some of the most desirable locations increased once again in 2017.There have been increases of up to 17 per cent for fincas in the north of the island and 11 per cent for villas in the west. Florian Fischer, managing partner of Engel \u0026amp Völkers estate agents, which has two outlets on Ibiza, says the luxury end of the market is strong: ‘The number of properties coming on to the market is growing in the luxury segment,’ he says.Engel \u0026amp Völkers cited the sustained growth of private air traffic to Ibiza – it rose by 8.5 per cent in 2017 – and an increase in the number of wealthy visitors drawn to the island’s marinas as indicators that the rich are favouring the island more and more.The company anticipates that residential properties on Ibiza will continue to have a high level of interest, particularly among international buyers and clients from the Spanish mainland, with the current new construction activity resulting in a higher availability of quality properties on the market.However, it feels strict building regulations will mean that a scarcity in supply can be expected in the long term.          A three-bedroom apartment in this block in Ibiza is selling for £481,000For €550,000 (£481,000), Engel \u0026amp Völkers are selling a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment on the second floor of the building Nueva Ibiza, in Ibiza town. There is air conditioning and the block has a lift. There is also a 24-hour security service, gardens and a communal pool.If having a return on your investment is what you’re after, you may feel more comfortable investing in property in Britain. In which case you could enter the buy-to-let market. One way to do this with the confidence of knowing that you will have a guaranteed income is to buy in a development that promises a certain yield.Developer Crest Nicholson say that investors will receive a return of six per cent for two years if they buy an apartment in Bath Riverside, a collection of flats and penthouse apartments a short walk from the city centre. The variety of accommodation – set on the banks of the River Avon – stretches from studios to four-bedroom homes.Just across the river is the Royal Victoria Park, a substantial green area that includes botanical gardens, children’s play area, tennis courts and Victorian landscaping.However, it is northern England that is regularly top when it comes to percentage profit from buy- to-lets. The cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds have properties that can command yields of eight per cent.It’s surely no coincidence that these cities also have high student populations, and in recent years landlords have profited from the need for housing for the increasing numbers of students in the areas.But if there is someone in your family moving to another part of the country for further education, why not buy a property for him or her so you know they have somewhere decent to live when they are there? And after they have left it could be let to other students.On pages two and three of this supplement we have already dealt with the benefits of new-builds, particularly for first-time buyers.Many of those incentives are transferrable for the buy-to- let market.While you won’t be able to take advantage of Help to Buy, there are other measures that developers offer that might bring down the cost of your investment.Companies such as Galliard Homes have a number of incentives, such as properties coming fully furnished – as many of their new-builds do, including Harbour Central in London’s Docklands.There, Galliard provide Smeg integrated kitchen appliances and free furniture packages that include 40-50in LED TVs, Sonos playbars and mood-lighting.Across the Thames at Surrey Quays, Galliard are specifically targeting investors with their offers at the Marine Wharf East development.Galliard are offering a three per cent discount, a service charge allowance plus a free parking space with three-bedroom apartments there.And in Shoreditch, at their Stage development, Galliard are offsetting the extra three per cent Stamp Duty surcharge that investors pay if buying additional residential properties within England, Wales and Northern Ireland.The Stage also has a unique history to it – the 37-storey tower will include 412 apartments designed around the remains of Shakespeare’s original Curtain Theatre.  Discover the joys of lodge life When it comes to holiday homes in Britain, park homes can work out very cost effective. Because of how they are constructed, they are often a lot cheaper than traditional bricks and mortar houses. And some are located in the most spectacular settings.One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams. The site includes a collection of contemporary cedar lodges set among landscaped grounds which boast more than 1,000 species of rare and exotic plants, trees and shrubs from around the world.          One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams (pictured) It extends to five and half acres on the edge of Dartmoor and, as the grounds were established more than 25 years ago, the plots have the privacy that a mature woodland setting can afford.Co-owner Matt Morgan grew up on the farm where the lodges now sit and has been planning the site for more than 30 years.Six lodges are currently available to buy, starting from £175,000 for a two-bedroom and rising to £255,000 for a three-bedroom lodge.Peter and Yvette Cheeseman, both retirees from Dorset, say they made a lifestyle investment when they purchased their Palstone lodge and claim their family now saves £10,000 a year on holidays.‘We had money available from our pension and we were trying to think about what we might be able to buy,’ says Peter.‘We liked the idea of escaping to Devon to get away from our busy lives in Dorset where I still have business interests and Yvette competes with her horses.’          Devon delight: One of the Palstone lodgesWhat really stood out for Peter and Yvette were the secluded plots the lodges were sat on and how they are exclusively for the use of owners, their friends and family only.‘That gave us the added confidence that we were making the right decision,’ says Peter. ‘It meant that we could have certainty and peace of mind that people buying at Palstone Lodges genuinely cared about their property and who stays there.’Peter and Yvette’s four children also enjoy their Devon bolt-hole. ‘For them, it’s a free holiday,’ says Peter. ‘We take pleasure in the fact that we’re giving them something special as part of our family unit.’Each plot has a 125-year licence and annual service charges of £2,750, plus VAT, which covers garden and grounds maintenance and general insurance. Each property is free from Stamp Duty and Council Tax.The lodges are designed as holiday homes and not places of permanent residence.          Regulars: Phil and Rebecca Grant with their children Rory and OscarRebecca and Phil Grant, from Harpenden in Hertfordshire, often come to their Palstone lodge with their children Rory and Oscar.‘For me, working in horticulture, the attraction came from the setting, with established planting and carefully curated landscaping,’ says Rebecca. ‘It seemed to suit us perfectly. We wanted a gentle, soft green space.’Since buying more than ten years ago, they have visited the lodge most months, taking extra time there in the summers.Rebecca and Phil have made good friends with the neighbours and even socialise with them away from Palstone Lodges. Rebecca feels this has been of vital importance to them, and even more so now they have a young family.‘When we visit now we know people are there, some of whom have become great friends, but we can’t hear or see them from our lodge,’ says Rebecca.‘It’s really nice to have a sense that everyone who has a home there wants a similar way of life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/19/4D62E26B00000578-5878117-image-a-5_1529780104780.jpg","title":"Boom Boom Boris blasts Becker insists hes not broke","story":"    Boris Becker has been declared bankrupt and forced to sell his precious trophies to begin paying off a rumoured £54 million debt, while his nine-year marriage to Lilly, the mother of his eight-year-old son, has collapsedIt has been a tumultuous year, to say the least, for Boris Becker.The former Wimbledon champion has been declared bankrupt and forced to sell his precious trophies to begin paying off a rumoured £54 million debt, while his nine-year marriage to Lilly, the mother of his eight-year-old son, has collapsed.Then, in a farcical twist to an already bizarre story, he was accused of falsely claiming to be a diplomat for the Central African Republic in a bid to wriggle out of paying his debts. On Friday, even the country’s foreign minister, Charles Armel Doubane, called Becker’s diplomatic passport a fake.So it’s a surprise to see the tennis legend so ebullient. He’s frustrated, yes, but still instantly recognisable as the irrepressible, confidently –and often bluntly – outspoken Boris whose BBC commentary will again entertain and inform Wimbledon fans when the tournament starts next week.And in a series of volleys of the same ferocity that earned him the nickname Boom Boom Becker during his stellar tennis career, he hits back, saying:He’s not bankrupt – in fact he makes ‘more money than 99 per cent of the world’ and has paid the money he owesHe is a genuine diplomat with the passport to prove it, and he took the role purely because of his ‘passion for humanitarian affairs’Divorcing his second wife at the age of 50 makes him ‘conservative’ compared to other celebrities.          In a series of volleys of the same ferocity that earned him the nickname Boom Boom Becker during his stellar tennis career, he insists that he is not bankruptBoris admits that since the High Court declared him insolvent on June 21, 2017, ‘it’s probably been the most difficult year of my life. \u0027The case has put a lot of pressure on me. \u0027I know how it looks from the outside. Whatever I owe, the price I’m paying is much higher.’But after reading the torrent of stories about himself – in which he claims ‘the only thing they did write correctly was my name’ – he’s here to set the record straight. And, he says, the true picture is very different from what’s been reported.                            This has been the most difficult year of my life                         First and foremost, he says: ‘I’m not broke’ – emphasising he’s been made personally bankrupt, not professionally bankrupt.‘Boris Becker plc is doing very well. We are still making more money than 99 per cent of the world, let’s be realistic. \u0027I have plenty of money in my account, my credit card works and everything’s normal.‘Yet the whole world is asking, “But how can you pay for dinner? How can you pay for your flat? We thought you were bankrupt.” \u0027But as far as I’m concerned, I’ve paid all I owe. I’m not running from my responsibilities. \u0027On the contrary, I would like to close the insolvency book as quickly as possible.’          Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woesMost of what’s happened is, he insists, a big misunderstanding, which he describes in detail during our meeting at his agent’s office. His blue eyes fix me with an intense gaze throughout the conversation, but when he smiles, his face transforms back into that of the good-natured boy from Germany who won Wimbledon aged just 17 in 1985. Wearing an expensive suit paired with red Puma trainers, his hair slicked back and a smattering of sunburn, he looks relaxed, but says he is ready to do battle.‘I’ve never been afraid of a fight,’ he says, with a flash of the grit that won him six major singles titles.He triggered a collective raising of eyebrows earlier this month when it was reported that he had become a diplomat for the Central African Republic. As his lawyers pointed out to the High Court, this would make him immune from bankruptcy proceedings under the 1961 Vienna Convention. To critics, the timing of his appointment as sports ambassador to a tiny nation seemed a little too convenient.Cherubin Moroubama, chief of staff for the nation’s foreign ministry, said: ‘The diplomatic passport that he has is a fake’, adding that its serial number corresponded to a batch stolen in 2014. The country’s prosecutor is now investigating.But according to Boris, his appointment is real and he has the paperwork to prove it.‘I was approached by the ambassador of the CAR in March and consequently met the President who asked if I’d be interested in representing the country internationally, and I was very honoured,’ he says. ‘I was inaugurated by the president in April in Brussels, witnessed by dignitaries from the CAR and my own legal advisers as well as the ambassador who gave me the diplomatic documents and a passport which is currently at the US embassy in Brussels for visa applications, so I don’t have it with me.‘I agree that the comments from the foreign minister and his office are confusing and perplexing. I’m very keen this should be resolved.’And he insists: ‘My appointment has nothing to do with my insolvency case. Humanitarian affairs are something I care deeply about.’          He’s aware some people assume a major reason for his money troubles are the payouts he’s made to women, first to Barbara (pictured), mother of his two eldest sons, in 2000, then to Russian model Angela Ermakova, with whom he fathered a daughter, Anna, after a tryst in a London restaurantBut Boris, I ask, have you ever been to the Central African Republic? ‘No, not yet, I was only recently appointed,’ he says, adding quickly: ‘We’ve been looking at dates, but the President is a busy man.’He says the reason the High Court was told of his new diplomatic status was purely because he was bound to disclose his new, official address in Brussels. Can he see, though, how it could be viewed as a scheme cooked up to help him out of his predicament?‘I can see why it could look like that,’ he concedes. ‘But that’s why I’m talking to The Mail on Sunday now, to put the record straight.’Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woes. ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process,’ he says.Love split Lilly turns her back on Boris Becker after nine...Share this article‘We are moving on and ultimately, there will be a orce. It’s being done as amicably as possible and our main concern is Amadeus. Lilly’s a wonderful woman and a great mother, but people unfortunately break up.’The continuing interest in his private life frustrates him. ‘When I look at how many celebrities have been married and orced since I split up with my first wife, Barbara 19 years ago, I’m very conservative. \u0027My second orce and I’m 50 – could be worse!’ He’s aware some people assume a major reason for his money troubles are the payouts he’s made to women, first to Barbara, mother of his two eldest sons, in 2000, then to Russian model Angela Ermakova, with whom he fathered a daughter, Anna, after a tryst in a London restaurant.  In a farcical twist to an already bizarre story, he was accused of falsely claiming to be a diplomat for the Central African Republic in a bid to wriggle out of paying his debts. He is pictured left with President Faustin Archange Touadera‘That’s absolutely not accurate,’ he says. ‘I had a pre-nup with my first wife and a orce in Germany so whatever people fantasised about a double-digit million number, not true. \u0027But more importantly, we’re on great terms. And Anna is on great form and my relationship with her mother is intact.’He’s found recent reports about his mansion in Majorca being taken over by squatters perplexing ‘because I sold it two years ago. \u0027It’s terrible that squatters are there, but it’s not mine’.Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes them.          Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes themBecker puts the figure at £3.4 million and claims that the bank charged him 25 per cent interest – claims the bank deny.He also claims the bank has used his celebrity status to demand more, and says he tried to find a solution before the bankruptcy judgment last June, such as moving the loan to another bank. ‘But there was no chance for me to negotiate a settlement. They refused to meet me and my advisers and they kept moving me into insolvency.’But the bank say: ‘Mr Becker’s colourful version of events simply does not tally with the facts and has already been dismissed by a judge. Arbuthnot Latham has at all times dealt with Mr Becker in good faith.’The £54 million figure bandied about for Boris’s total debts – including a claim for £34 million from a Swiss businessman – is absurd, he says. ‘How can you spend that much? Do you see any yachts?’But he says. ‘I have a good income and can spend whatever I want.’He can’t deny he’s made some poor business decisions over the years. In 2002, he received a two-year suspended sentence in Germany for tax evasion. Some of his businesses, including the website Sportgate, have failed. ‘Mistakes have been made, but Sportgate was almost 20 years ago. That’s business.’He adds: ‘I’ve never been driven by money. I won my first Wimbledon and forgot to take the pay check because it wasn’t important to me. I just wanted to win.’ Still, he was ‘completely taken aback’ by the High Court judgment, which he says, in typical Boris-speak, ‘happened to me like a baby to a virgin’.He believes the assets which have been collected from him in the past year by the court-appointed trustees from law firm Smith \u0026amp Williamson, which total £4.4 million, more than cover the debt. ‘I’m happy to pay back what I owe,’ he says.Theoretically, he should have been discharged from bankruptcy last week, a year after the ruling. However, the situation is rumbling on. ‘The trustee wants to prolong the insolvency for at least another six months because he doesn’t believe I’m co-operative,’ he says.    Speaking of his orce from Lilly, Boris said: ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process\u0027Boris does not believe the trustee is as neutral as he should be. ‘For some reason, they were fascinated with selling all my trophies, although I explained to them that they have strong emotional value but very little financial value. \u0027There was no need to do it, but that’s just taking the knife and digging it into my heart and saying, “We have you and we can do what we want.” ’The trustees, however, say their job is to act in the best interests of Boris’s creditors and say the sale of his trophies and memorabilia should raise more than £200,000, ‘not a sum we consider immaterial’.Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. ‘The fact is we’re going back to court soon to fight this and expect to win. I strongly feel that they were taking advantage of my fame and they thought I couldn’t afford to go to court so I would probably agree to pay a much higher sum.  Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence and right victorious‘If you want to blackmail me, you’ve picked the wrong guy because I’m happy to fight.‘What they are doing isn’t right. It’s probably the toughest match of my life, but I’m not afraid. Let’s play. I’ve never been known as someone to run away.’He now has until July 30 to present evidence that he has paid what he owes and he hopes his insolvency will be over in October. ‘I’m looking forward to having this difficult year out of the way,’ he says.He’s also excited about Wimbledon, which begins on July 2. ‘It’s the best part of the year for me, working for the BBC and talking about tennis. This country has adopted me, it’s my home and I love it.‘I’ve had to concentrate at times on keeping my spirits and sense of humour up by remembering what my passion is.’He says his ordeal has made him more reflective. ‘Some of what has happened I think is because I’m Boris Becker, a celebrity. But that’s the price to pay for all the opportunities I’ve had.‘I have a chance now to wipe the slate clean, to learn from my mistakes, to associate myself with better people perhaps. I’m not bitter. I’m healthy, I have a job I love and a wonderful family. I have a lot going for me.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/20/4D8F5E1300000578-5878161-image-a-39_1529781037200.jpg","title":"The downsizing lowdown make moving smaller home","story":"    Home comforts: The Greenhouse and Pavillion at Wadswick Green in WiltshireCraig Gibson, a partner at WDM Chartered Accountants, says: ‘Homes are a massive asset for people who have been committed to them for decades, so understanding your options is essential, especially when you’re selling.’And if you’re tempted to hand over your house or large chunks of money to your children, he says, ‘there are some ways to give your children cash or your home, but it’s very important to get good independent financial advice’. For instance, the annual allowance for tax-free gifts to children (or anyone else) is £3,000 per person. But parents can give up to £5,000 to children as wedding or civil-partnership gifts tax-free. Regular payments are exempt from inheritance tax, as long as they come from your income and not your savings and don’t significantly affect your lifestyle.When downsizing, it is important to consider what would be left to your children when you die.The inheritance-tax threshold currently stands at £325,000, and the rate payable on estates of more than that is 40 per cent of the amount above £325,000. The exception is if you are married, as you can pass your full estate to your spouse in the event of your death without paying inheritance tax. By doing this you also pass on your £325,000 inheritance-tax exemption, so £650,000 of your combined estate would then be free from inheritance tax.          Luxury living: One of Birchgrove\u0027s apartments in SidcupIf you go into residential care, you may have to sell your home to pay for it. One way to hold on to your home so you can pass the proceeds on to your children is to buy in a retirement development, like Wadswick Green in Wiltshire, where help is on hand for that care. However, exit fees that the development takes when you die will deplete any money you can pass on – as will service charges.Another option to free up money from your home is equity release. You have to be over 55 to go down this path, but it allows you to release money as a lump sum, or in several smaller amounts, or as a combination of both. And while equity-release products give you access to the cash in your home, they tend to be more expensive than regular mortgages and have associated fees. Triggering equity release may also affect your ability to claim state benefits.With so many people’s money in bricks and mortar – and with, these days, so many options available to those reaching retirement age – it’s no wonder that experts say it’s more important than ever before to look at ‘succession planning’.  Rent your way to riches In America, Australia and on the Continent, renting in retirement is much more popular than here. The British obsession with home ownership means we are keener than those in other countries to tie up our money in property.But there was 13 per cent increase in retired renters here between 2012 to 2016, according to the National Landlords Association, and Scottish Widows recently predicted figures will double to nine million by 2022.

Perched on top of the dome was a statue of Neptune, which protruded from the lake’s surface and was the only part of the structure visible from land.An air vent emerged through Neptune’s mouth and wisps of smoke were sometimes seen drifting out of it when Wright and his friends were enjoying cigars.To ensure clear views, Wright hired ers to keep the dome free from algae. Spellbound guests were able to watch fish and sometimes swimmers overhead. On summer nights, he switched off the lights so his friends could watch firework displays or gaze at the stars magnified by curved glass and water.A short flight of steps led to another underwater room with concrete walls and a curved ceiling supported on cast-iron columns. Lit by porthole-shaped skylights and equipped with a billiards table and card tables, this was the Lord of the Manor’s secret gaming room, where the men could head off for post-prandial fun.Run-down farmhouse which was bought for £300,000 then...There’s not much SPACE! Boatbuilder creates tiny...Share this articleThe ladies were catered for, too. From the gaming room, another staircase led to a stone viewing platform on the surface of the lake, where on summer afternoons his wife Anna and her friends could take tea.Wright’s tale has fascinated me ever since I first encountered this underwater hideaway while researching architectural follies. I wondered what sort of person could have built such a place. And the answer, I found, was a man the Victorians called the Napoleon of Finance, whose epic story – the subject of my new biography – was in many ways a forerunner of more modern financial disasters.Corpulent, grandiose and bull-necked, James Wright was an unlikely tycoon. Born in 1846, the eldest of five children of a Methodist preacher, he, too, became a minister before setting up a printing business in Halifax with his brother that promptly went bankrupt.The pair narrowly avoided prison, and on their father’s death, both emigrated to Toronto. Wright – by now using his middle name Whitaker – was lured by an oil boom to Philadelphia, where he met and married Anna in 1878. He set up a series of businesses, again sailing perilously close to the wind. In 1877, he and four partners were accused of making false claims in the prospectus of a new company and charged with conspiracy to defraud stockholders. Yet Wright escaped prosecution and, ever the adventurer, decided to became a prospector in America’s Wild West. An outgoing man with a quick wit and a ready charm, he made friends freely in saloons and gambling dens. Indeed, he enjoyed the rough-and-tumble boomtown life and later claimed he had witnessed ‘fierce revolver fights in the dancing halls’.          Deep secret: The underwater dome\u0027s 200 panes of glass were kept clean by a team of ersIt was in Leadville, Colorado, that he made his first fortune, talking up the prospects of a silver mine in 1880 and floating the company for $5 million (about £85 million in today’s money) on the New York stock exchange.By the time the business went bust, Wright had made a fat profit and was long gone. He repeated the trick in Utah, California, Nevada and New Mexico, where he set up a company that initially, at least, rewarded its investors handsomely.For the first five months it paid out $100,000 a month in idends as more than $1 million in silver was brought to the surface. The company’s share price soared, but again the bonanza did not last. In 1889, with his reputation tarnished and creditors breathing down his neck, he decided to reinvent himself in the land of his birth. Wright began promoting West Australian gold mines on the London stock exchange and, as the money rolled in like never before, he looked for a country property befitting of his enormous wealth, in part to prove to himself and his family that he had left that early disgrace in Halifax far behind.With money no object, he bought two tracts of land at Witley, near Godalming, paying £150,000 for the Lea Park estate, which included a 19th Century manor house, and £100,000 for the adjacent South Park Farm estate.Striding through his 9,000 acres, which contained 90 miles of roads and lanes, five lodges and ten farms, he set his swirling imagination to work. A small tributary of the River Wey meandered through the grounds, but Wright envisaged a series of great lakes, complete with islands. Most of the exotic ideas were his own. Under the direction of London architect Paxton Hood Watson, two wings were added to the existing manor house at the stupendous cost of £400,000.          Whitaker Wright was convicted of fraud in 2004The new west wing was adorned with a vast conservatory, which alone cost £10,000 (about £1 million today) and a large central glass dome filled with trees and exotic plants from across the world – a rival to Kew Gardens. The east wing, meanwhile, accommodated a domed observatory with a revolving copper roof.Between these two great embellishments were 32 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and seven reception rooms, the largest of which, at more than 2,600 square feet, was the cedar-panelled ballroom, with a dancefloor capable of accommodating hundreds. Wright even found room for a small private hospital and, oddly, one of Britain’s first private velodromes.The stable block, capable of holding 50 horses, was a centrally heated equine palace with a viewing space from which visitors could admire their mounts from the comfort of leather-upholstered settees shaded by palms. Months of work resulted in the creation of the square lake, the bathing lake and the big lake. A boathouse was home to a flotilla of electric launches, sailing craft and rowing boats.It all came at quite a cost. Over the years his improvements to the estate cost an estimated £1,115,000 – then an extraordinary amount of money. But the overblown and impossibly extravagant house – he had a staff of 77 – was a perfect expression of his creator.In Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee year of 1897, government Ministers and peers were among those who rushed to buy shares in his booming London and Globe Company and other mining-related companies.To impress investors, Wright made a point of appointing Establishment figures as directors. Future prime minister Arthur Balfour and members of the Spencer-Churchill family all invested. Even the Royal Family was said to have benefited.Whether or not these rumours were true, they were widely believed and Wright did nothing to dispel them. He established another Royal connection when he struck up a friendship with the spendthrift Sir James Reid, personal physician to Queen Victoria – in 1896 he sought Wright’s advice on how to make a killing on the stock market.To the world at large, it seemed he could do no wrong.But like the latter-day conman Charles Ponzi, inventor of the fraud scheme that bears his name, Wright’s business acumen was not as it seemed.          A dolphin\u0027s head water feature in the grounds of the estate which included lakes and islandsJust as in America, many of his much-vaunted mining prospects turned out to be duds and he used accounting tricks to make them appear solvent in annual accounts All such frauds must, eventually, come crashing down.And in a true fin de siècle moment, his house of cards collapsed on the last day of trading of the 19th Century.Panic spread in the stock market. Shares in Wright’s companies halved and 20 firms of stockbrokers were ruined.Wright fled to France and boarded a liner to New York, only to be arrested on arrival thanks to a transatlantic cable from Scotland Yard. He was brought back to London to stand trial.On January 26, 1904, he was convicted of fraud at the Royal Courts of Justice and given a seven-year prison sentence, but he evaded justice by swallowing cyanide in a court anteroom almost immediately afterwards.Magnificent as it was, Wright’s great project at Lea Park was never completed. After passing through a variety of owners, the big house burned down in 1952 and the buildings were demolished.The underwater dome, still watertight after 120 years, is now a Grade II-listed building – a monument not merely to folly, but to a life of extraordinary excess.lUltimate Folly: The Rises And Falls Of Whitaker Wright, by Henry Macrory, is published by Biteback at £20.

He also urged YSK members to \u0027do your job the right way\u0027, adding he believed the results would be \u0027very good\u0027.Opposition parties and NGOs deployed up to half a million monitors at ballot boxes to ward against fraud. They have said election law changes and fraud allegations in the 2017 referendum raise fears about the vote\u0027s fairness.Earlier, CHP spokesman Bulent Tezcan said the party had reported to the YSK allegations of block votes being cast and of election monitors being beaten and kept out of polling stations in the southeast\u0027s Sanliurfa province.YSK chairman Sadi Guven told the state-owned news agency Anadolu it was taking steps in response to reports of irregularities in the town of Suruc near the Syrian border.The government gave no immediate response to the reports, but Erdogan said there had not been any serious problems.           Earlier today opposition party member Mehmet Sıddık Durmaz (pictured) was reportedly shot dead \u0027during the voting process\u0027, local media said          A woman waits to vote at a polling station in snap twin Turkish presidential and parliamentary elections in Istanbul today          Turks went to the polls this morning in presidential and parliamentary elections that pose the biggest ballot box challenge to Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party since they swept to power over 15 years ago          Chairman of the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his wife Selvi Kilicdaroglu arrive to cast their ballot at a polling station during the parliamentary and presidential elections, in AnkaraErdogan vows to become Turkey\u0027s \u0027grandmaster\u0027: President...Erdogan bans Uber: Turkish president bows to pressure from...Revealed: UK holidaymakers travelling to Europe after Brexit...Brussels plots to make Britons buy £50 visas to visit Europe...Share this articleTurkey has been under emergency rule - which restricts some freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with decrees - for nearly two years since an attempted coup in 2016.Erdogan blamed the coup on his former ally, U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and has waged a sweeping crackdown on his followers in Turkey, detaining some 160,000 people, according to the United Nations.The president\u0027s critics, including the European Union which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent.Ince told a rally on Saturday he would lift the state of emergency within 48 hours of being elected president. He also vowed to reverse what opposition parties see as Turkey\u0027s swing towards authoritarian rule under Erdogan.\u0027This is no longer a Turkey we want.

Come, confront me, let\u0027s debate on TV.\u0027The event was the second giant rally the opposition leader addressed within the space of two days.Erdogan, a favourite to win the presidential polls, has in the past rejected the opposition candidate\u0027s proposal for a television debate, saying that \u0027I don\u0027t want anyone to get points through me\u0027.Ince has injected a breath of fresh air into the presidential campaign with his dynamism and oratorical skills comparable to those of Erdogan. In Ankara, Ince accused the state-run Anadolu news agency and TRT television of committing a \u0027constitutional crime\u0027 for failing to be even-handed.\u0027TRT aired Erdogan for 181 hours, Muharrem Ince for 15 hours,\u0027 he said.Turkey News, Pictures and Videos plus Erdogan Updates | Daily Mail OnlineİYİ Party district head shot dead during voting in Turkish election"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/21/4D5DAB7B00000578-0-image-m-58_1529786970174.jpg","title":"Top private schools including Eton shun new GCSEs favour easier tests","story":"Give me £20billion or I\u0027ll bring you down: Defence...Share this articleParent Shazia Aktar, whose 15-year old daughter is doing her GCSEs, branded the pressure students are put under as \u0027disgusting\u0027.She told MailOnline: \u0027I have a 15 year old daughter who cried when she returned home from school on Thursday after finishing her history paper.\u0027She was so upset she locked herself in her bedroom, she didn’t get to complete her paper.

To this day I am an early riser.But that is all about to change. Today sees the historic lifting of the ban on women drivers. Women can finally hit the road in Saudi Arabia: Female...Pink women-only parking spaces appear in Saudi Arabia ahead...Share this articleAnd for me, my sisters, and millions of Saudi women – many of whom have now won their licences from abroad – the day will be remembered as the culmination of years of struggle. A campaign for rights in a society that for far too long has been dominated by religious traditionalists who’ve chosen suffocating control over Saudi women, who are often far brighter and better educated than they are.          Pictured: Najah Al-OtaibiIt still staggers me that my country - with 25 per cent of the world’s oil reserves – holds the distinctly unflattering distinction of being the last country on earth to permit women to drive.But get ready! This is all about to change.Some 13,000 women have already applied for lessons with one Riyadh driving school alone. Its 45 female instructors are going to be busy. Online registration for another school attracted more than 165,000 applicants in just three days.It’s thought around 6million of us women – 65 per cent of the population – could obtain licenses. Not great for the environment perhaps – but a turbo charged boost for car manufacturers - and by 2030 it’s estimated the number of vehicles on the road will jump from the present 12million to 26million.But getting there will not be cheap. For some reason driving lessons for Saudi women are many times more expensive than for men. And yet both sexes are limited to the speed limit of 28mph in urban areas, and 50 to 87mph on main roads and motorways.Some chivalry does exist however – with special parking areas for female drivers at government buildings and universities – to stop the men taking them first.    Racer Aseel Al Hamad marked the end of the ban on women drivers in Saudi Arabia with a special drive in a Jaguar F-TYPEBut apart from the thrill of getting behind the wheel for the first time the real importance of the lifting of the ban will be the economic impact and empowerment it will have on women’s lives.In the past a driver would cost a family about 250 dollars a month. While this might be cheap for some privileged women, others simply can’t afford it. That quickly ate into the salary of a young couple where husband and wife both worked in relatively low earning jobs.Now a woman will be able to put that money towards her family and children – and drive them to school herself.Socially, women will also be unshackled from the control of their guardians. The traditional cast of men deciding everything for us has been broken. Women will be able to travel around the Kingdom and find new job opportunities.

When she texted back to say he had messaged the wrong person he called her, quickly charming her with tales of his high-flying career as a pilot for the Emirates airline. The scam was a carbon copy of the trick he used to sweet-talk his earlier victims and soon she was seeing him every chance she could – with no idea he was a jailed criminal. Within months they had a wedding ceremony at an imam’s house in London.Yesterday his 34-year-old ‘bride’ told of her anger that Haider, a married father of one, could continue ‘messing with people’s lives’ even when in prison. She said he told her ‘nearly all’ of the inmates at HMP Hewell, have access to smuggled phones.‘We’d meet up when he was on weekend or home leave – and the rest of the time he told me he was working up north’, she said.‘I can’t understand how somebody like him is able to carry on like this from a prison. More needs to be done to weed phones out of jails. I feel like I was sharing a bed with a stranger.’ The orcee, who lives in a village outside Worcester, called for laws to force ‘emotional confidence tricksters’ such as Haider to declare new relationships after a conviction. ‘Sex offenders are subjected to stringent licensing conditions, where sexual harm prevention orders require them to declare new relationships which can help to protect new partners. But there is nothing to protect the public from people like Haider,’ she said. It was one of Haider’s lies that led the woman to find out he was a jailed criminal – just weeks before his release on licence this March. After telling her he was under investigation for tax fraud, she googled the lawyer he had mentioned. The man had been involved in Haider’s trial and the search revealed articles about the conman.          Haider with one of his unfortunate victims ‘When I discovered who he really was, I hoped he’d changed, she said. ‘Unfortunately he is just an inveterate liar who causes people severe emotional harm. Everybody in his life is just a cast member to him – he kills people off whenever it is convenient for the particular lie he is spinning.’She broke up with him last month, after discovering he had been messaging the second woman, 47. By then, she had spent around £4,000 on Haider – who failed to repay her. Both women believe he obtained their phone numbers while using online dating sites under a pseudonym.In 2015, Birmingham Crown Court heard Haider persuaded three women to part with savings or take out loans – with one handing over £52,000. He told all three victims he was a budding Emirates airline pilot – but he had never worked for the firm.Haider, from Acocks Green, Birmingham, refused to comment when asked about his conduct outside his home this week.A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Using a mobile phone in prison is a crime and anyone found doing so can spend significantly longer behind bars.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/21/4D98EB0900000578-0-image-m-38_1529871172537.jpg","title":"Birmingham named UKs worst areas food hygiene second year running","story":"Birmingham, pictured, along with Hyndburn has been named as the UK\u0027s worst area for food          In Rishton in the Hydburn area just two in five of medium and high-risk food firms met hygiene standardsIn Hyndburn, the region which includes Accrington and has a population of 80,000, just two in five of medium and high-risk food firms met hygiene standards, according to Which?The study looked at data for 390 local authorities including information collected by the Food Standards Agency.

We’ll try again with them after four to five days.‘But many make it the first time. This goes back to how the person looks, how strong they are, their personality – if they know the language, that all affects how easy it is to move. \u0027The passport as well, if it’s legitimate, if the person looks like the picture, that all plays a role.’Ahmad offers three tiers of service. The cheapest, passport only, starts at £2,500, leaving the buyer to ‘sort himself out’ and try to reach a European Union country alone.For an extra £1,300 he arranges a Turkish entry stamp and pays off corrupt officials so that immigration records show the client had legitimately arrived in Turkey. The process takes ten days.The full-service package costs £7,000. Ahmad says: ‘It is a huge amount, but I arrange everything to help them leave. \u0027I book him a room in a hotel, I get them food, I get them a passport and entrance stamp and then when they leave they have to pay the money.‘Many people have never been to an airport before. The young man will check in for him, will guide him to security, then we’ll explain to him over the phone where to go until he reaches the gate.‘We’d have already explained to him any time he talks to us he should delete everything. Every time he contacts us, he has to delete it all from his phone.’Those making the trip on a fraudulent passport have a choice: either to pass through immigration control on arrival or claim asylum. Ahmad said: ‘If he looks a lot like the passport picture and he looks decent, he can land with it and pass through in a European airport.’          For £7,000 Ahmad books his client a hotel room, gets them food and hands over a stolen passport. This is the full-service package, with the cheapest being just the passport for £2,500If the client is planning to apply for asylum on arrival, he is told to go to the toilet on the plane and tear up the passport.‘We explain to him that once he arrives at the requested country, he shouldn’t hand himself in or leave immediately. He should hang around in transit for two to three hours, then he can go hand himself in or leave the airport,’ said Ahmad.‘We’d have already told him to not bring up that he came from Turkey. He should say he came from a different country. Egypt, Beirut, any other country besides Turkey.’Ahmad, a father of three, is a Palestinian-Syrian who studied medicine in Damascus and worked as heart doctor in the city’s Al Bassel Hospital before moving to Aleppo.He fled his homeland two years after the civil war broke out in 2011. ‘On our way to Greece we sank in the ocean,’ he said. ‘I spent 11 hours swimming and 140 people died. One of my friends drowned.‘The Turks caught us and saved us and brought us back here.

In a series of volleys of the same ferocity that earned him the nickname Boom Boom Becker during his stellar tennis career, he insists that he is not bankruptBoris admits that since the High Court declared him insolvent on June 21, 2017, ‘it’s probably been the most difficult year of my life. \u0027The case has put a lot of pressure on me. \u0027I know how it looks from the outside. Whatever I owe, the price I’m paying is much higher.’But after reading the torrent of stories about himself – in which he claims ‘the only thing they did write correctly was my name’ – he’s here to set the record straight. And, he says, the true picture is very different from what’s been reported.                            This has been the most difficult year of my life                         First and foremost, he says: ‘I’m not broke’ – emphasising he’s been made personally bankrupt, not professionally bankrupt.‘Boris Becker plc is doing very well. We are still making more money than 99 per cent of the world, let’s be realistic. \u0027I have plenty of money in my account, my credit card works and everything’s normal.‘Yet the whole world is asking, “But how can you pay for dinner? How can you pay for your flat? We thought you were bankrupt.” \u0027But as far as I’m concerned, I’ve paid all I owe. I’m not running from my responsibilities. \u0027On the contrary, I would like to close the insolvency book as quickly as possible.’          Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woesMost of what’s happened is, he insists, a big misunderstanding, which he describes in detail during our meeting at his agent’s office. His blue eyes fix me with an intense gaze throughout the conversation, but when he smiles, his face transforms back into that of the good-natured boy from Germany who won Wimbledon aged just 17 in 1985. Wearing an expensive suit paired with red Puma trainers, his hair slicked back and a smattering of sunburn, he looks relaxed, but says he is ready to do battle.‘I’ve never been afraid of a fight,’ he says, with a flash of the grit that won him six major singles titles.He triggered a collective raising of eyebrows earlier this month when it was reported that he had become a diplomat for the Central African Republic. As his lawyers pointed out to the High Court, this would make him immune from bankruptcy proceedings under the 1961 Vienna Convention. To critics, the timing of his appointment as sports ambassador to a tiny nation seemed a little too convenient.Cherubin Moroubama, chief of staff for the nation’s foreign ministry, said: ‘The diplomatic passport that he has is a fake’, adding that its serial number corresponded to a batch stolen in 2014. The country’s prosecutor is now investigating.But according to Boris, his appointment is real and he has the paperwork to prove it.‘I was approached by the ambassador of the CAR in March and consequently met the President who asked if I’d be interested in representing the country internationally, and I was very honoured,’ he says. ‘I was inaugurated by the president in April in Brussels, witnessed by dignitaries from the CAR and my own legal advisers as well as the ambassador who gave me the diplomatic documents and a passport which is currently at the US embassy in Brussels for visa applications, so I don’t have it with me.‘I agree that the comments from the foreign minister and his office are confusing and perplexing. I’m very keen this should be resolved.’And he insists: ‘My appointment has nothing to do with my insolvency case. Humanitarian affairs are something I care deeply about.’          He’s aware some people assume a major reason for his money troubles are the payouts he’s made to women, first to Barbara (pictured), mother of his two eldest sons, in 2000, then to Russian model Angela Ermakova, with whom he fathered a daughter, Anna, after a tryst in a London restaurantBut Boris, I ask, have you ever been to the Central African Republic? ‘No, not yet, I was only recently appointed,’ he says, adding quickly: ‘We’ve been looking at dates, but the President is a busy man.’He says the reason the High Court was told of his new diplomatic status was purely because he was bound to disclose his new, official address in Brussels. Can he see, though, how it could be viewed as a scheme cooked up to help him out of his predicament?‘I can see why it could look like that,’ he concedes. ‘But that’s why I’m talking to The Mail on Sunday now, to put the record straight.’Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woes. ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process,’ he says.Love split Lilly turns her back on Boris Becker after nine...Share this article‘We are moving on and ultimately, there will be a orce. It’s being done as amicably as possible and our main concern is Amadeus. Lilly’s a wonderful woman and a great mother, but people unfortunately break up.’The continuing interest in his private life frustrates him. ‘When I look at how many celebrities have been married and orced since I split up with my first wife, Barbara 19 years ago, I’m very conservative. \u0027My second orce and I’m 50 – could be worse!’ He’s aware some people assume a major reason for his money troubles are the payouts he’s made to women, first to Barbara, mother of his two eldest sons, in 2000, then to Russian model Angela Ermakova, with whom he fathered a daughter, Anna, after a tryst in a London restaurant.  In a farcical twist to an already bizarre story, he was accused of falsely claiming to be a diplomat for the Central African Republic in a bid to wriggle out of paying his debts. He is pictured left with President Faustin Archange Touadera‘That’s absolutely not accurate,’ he says. ‘I had a pre-nup with my first wife and a orce in Germany so whatever people fantasised about a double-digit million number, not true. \u0027But more importantly, we’re on great terms. And Anna is on great form and my relationship with her mother is intact.’He’s found recent reports about his mansion in Majorca being taken over by squatters perplexing ‘because I sold it two years ago. \u0027It’s terrible that squatters are there, but it’s not mine’.Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes them.          Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes themBecker puts the figure at £3.4 million and claims that the bank charged him 25 per cent interest – claims the bank deny.He also claims the bank has used his celebrity status to demand more, and says he tried to find a solution before the bankruptcy judgment last June, such as moving the loan to another bank. ‘But there was no chance for me to negotiate a settlement. They refused to meet me and my advisers and they kept moving me into insolvency.’But the bank say: ‘Mr Becker’s colourful version of events simply does not tally with the facts and has already been dismissed by a judge. Arbuthnot Latham has at all times dealt with Mr Becker in good faith.’The £54 million figure bandied about for Boris’s total debts – including a claim for £34 million from a Swiss businessman – is absurd, he says. ‘How can you spend that much? Do you see any yachts?’But he says. ‘I have a good income and can spend whatever I want.’He can’t deny he’s made some poor business decisions over the years. In 2002, he received a two-year suspended sentence in Germany for tax evasion. Some of his businesses, including the website Sportgate, have failed. ‘Mistakes have been made, but Sportgate was almost 20 years ago. That’s business.’He adds: ‘I’ve never been driven by money. I won my first Wimbledon and forgot to take the pay check because it wasn’t important to me. I just wanted to win.’ Still, he was ‘completely taken aback’ by the High Court judgment, which he says, in typical Boris-speak, ‘happened to me like a baby to a virgin’.He believes the assets which have been collected from him in the past year by the court-appointed trustees from law firm Smith \u0026amp Williamson, which total £4.4 million, more than cover the debt. ‘I’m happy to pay back what I owe,’ he says.Theoretically, he should have been discharged from bankruptcy last week, a year after the ruling. However, the situation is rumbling on. ‘The trustee wants to prolong the insolvency for at least another six months because he doesn’t believe I’m co-operative,’ he says.    Speaking of his orce from Lilly, Boris said: ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process\u0027Boris does not believe the trustee is as neutral as he should be. ‘For some reason, they were fascinated with selling all my trophies, although I explained to them that they have strong emotional value but very little financial value. \u0027There was no need to do it, but that’s just taking the knife and digging it into my heart and saying, “We have you and we can do what we want.” ’The trustees, however, say their job is to act in the best interests of Boris’s creditors and say the sale of his trophies and memorabilia should raise more than £200,000, ‘not a sum we consider immaterial’.Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. ‘The fact is we’re going back to court soon to fight this and expect to win. I strongly feel that they were taking advantage of my fame and they thought I couldn’t afford to go to court so I would probably agree to pay a much higher sum.  Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence and right victorious‘If you want to blackmail me, you’ve picked the wrong guy because I’m happy to fight.‘What they are doing isn’t right. It’s probably the toughest match of my life, but I’m not afraid. Let’s play. I’ve never been known as someone to run away.’He now has until July 30 to present evidence that he has paid what he owes and he hopes his insolvency will be over in October. ‘I’m looking forward to having this difficult year out of the way,’ he says.He’s also excited about Wimbledon, which begins on July 2. ‘It’s the best part of the year for me, working for the BBC and talking about tennis. This country has adopted me, it’s my home and I love it.‘I’ve had to concentrate at times on keeping my spirits and sense of humour up by remembering what my passion is.’He says his ordeal has made him more reflective. ‘Some of what has happened I think is because I’m Boris Becker, a celebrity. But that’s the price to pay for all the opportunities I’ve had.‘I have a chance now to wipe the slate clean, to learn from my mistakes, to associate myself with better people perhaps. I’m not bitter. I’m healthy, I have a job I love and a wonderful family. I have a lot going for me.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/22/4D990B5D00000578-5879221-image-a-59_1529874253608.jpg","title":"Polls open Turkeys fiercely fought elections years","story":"    President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaking at a press conference at his palace in which he declared his coalition had won the election          Erdogan speaks to his supporters in front of his palace after a press conference in which he said he hoped \u0027no-one would cast a shadow on his victory\u0027    A vast crowd of President Erdogan\u0027s supporters gathered outside the AKP\u0027s headquarters in Istanbul to herald the victory          A man stands through the sunroof of a moving car holding a scarf with the name of the incumbent President in bold white letters          Traffic in the Turkish city of Bursa is brought to a standstill as AKP supporters invade the streets during wild celebrations across the country          A crowd of women take to the streets to celebrate the President\u0027s return to power in the face of stiff opposition from several outsiders          A woman wearing a hijab speaks on a microphone while several AKP supporters bear banners with the party\u0027s logo on behind her          AKP supporters rush in front of a coach while celebrating after state media in Turkey declared President Erdogan had won Sunday\u0027s election          The election victory returns Erdogan to power for a fourth successive term having ascended to the role for the first time in 2014          An Erdogan supporter brandishes a red flare in one and and a Turkish flag in the other while hanging out the side of a van in Istanbul          Two women celebrate from the sun roof of a saloon car in Istanbul as they speed past gathered crowds on the edge of the road          Several cars in the Turkish city of Istanbul brandished flags out of their car windows bearing the face of victorious President Erdogan          Supporters of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan light torches in front of a Turkish flag as the media announced the ruling AKP party had won          A group of fervent Erdogan suppporters light flares and hold a portrait of the president aloft as they begin wild celebrations in Istanbul          A woman wearing a hijab sits on the window of a car to take pictures of the gathered crowds during celebrations after the announcement          A pair of female AKP supporters hold an enormous Turkish flag aloft and wear banners and face paint supporting the returning Erdogan          Erdogan\u0027s supporters celebrate outside the AK party headquarters in Istanbul on Sunday as the results of the vote slowly rolled in          Supporters of the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u0027 Democratic Party, or HDP, dance in the street celebrating in the mainly-Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, southeastern Turkey after winning a large enough share of the vote to enter parliament          Women dance under election banners of the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u0027 Democratic Party, or HDP, in the mainly-Kurdish city of Diyarbakir          A supporter of the HDP holds two green flares over his head as crowds gather in the center of Diyarbakir to celebrate the victory          A colourfully dressed woman waves a Kurdish flag in celebration under the banners of the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u0027 Democratic PartyEarlier today the vote was marred by violence after reports that opposition party member Mehmet Sıddık Durmaz was shot dead \u0027during the voting process\u0027. Hurriyet reported that Durmaz, of the IYI Party, was \u0027brutally shot dead by inglorious, dishonest people\u0027 in Erzurum, according to party officials. The newspaper added that a fight broke out after dozens of officials from the interior ministry arrived during voting, according to the Republican People\u0027s Party\u0027s head in Erzurum.Hüsnü Yılan added: \u0027An MP hopeful from the AKP came and we did not accept his presence either.

He also urged YSK members to \u0027do your job the right way\u0027, adding he believed the results would be \u0027very good\u0027.Opposition parties and NGOs deployed up to half a million monitors at ballot boxes to ward against fraud.

To this day I am an early riser.But that is all about to change. Today sees the historic lifting of the ban on women drivers. Women can finally hit the road in Saudi Arabia: Female...Pink women-only parking spaces appear in Saudi Arabia ahead...Share this articleAnd for me, my sisters, and millions of Saudi women – many of whom have now won their licences from abroad – the day will be remembered as the culmination of years of struggle. A campaign for rights in a society that for far too long has been dominated by religious traditionalists who’ve chosen suffocating control over Saudi women, who are often far brighter and better educated than they are.          Pictured: Najah Al-OtaibiIt still staggers me that my country - with 25 per cent of the world’s oil reserves – holds the distinctly unflattering distinction of being the last country on earth to permit women to drive.But get ready! This is all about to change.Some 13,000 women have already applied for lessons with one Riyadh driving school alone. Its 45 female instructors are going to be busy. Online registration for another school attracted more than 165,000 applicants in just three days.It’s thought around 6million of us women – 65 per cent of the population – could obtain licenses. Not great for the environment perhaps – but a turbo charged boost for car manufacturers - and by 2030 it’s estimated the number of vehicles on the road will jump from the present 12million to 26million.But getting there will not be cheap. For some reason driving lessons for Saudi women are many times more expensive than for men. And yet both sexes are limited to the speed limit of 28mph in urban areas, and 50 to 87mph on main roads and motorways.Some chivalry does exist however – with special parking areas for female drivers at government buildings and universities – to stop the men taking them first.    Racer Aseel Al Hamad marked the end of the ban on women drivers in Saudi Arabia with a special drive in a Jaguar F-TYPEBut apart from the thrill of getting behind the wheel for the first time the real importance of the lifting of the ban will be the economic impact and empowerment it will have on women’s lives.In the past a driver would cost a family about 250 dollars a month. While this might be cheap for some privileged women, others simply can’t afford it. That quickly ate into the salary of a young couple where husband and wife both worked in relatively low earning jobs.Now a woman will be able to put that money towards her family and children – and drive them to school herself.Socially, women will also be unshackled from the control of their guardians. The traditional cast of men deciding everything for us has been broken. Women will be able to travel around the Kingdom and find new job opportunities. And more importantly escape any domestic abuse. In 2016 there were 11,000 reports of abuse of women and children in Saudi Arabia. This is partly because women are prevented from leaving their household without permission.          A Saudi woman is pictured with her new driving licence after the country\u0027s driving ban ended          Women in Saudi Arabia are able to drive for the first time ever as part of a historic move by Crown Prince Mohammed bin SalmanDriving will open up new employment opportunities for women who despite making up the majority of University graduates, only represent around 22 of the workforce.By lifting the ban on women will be able to work in cars sales, training and qualifying for driving, carrying out car services and working for Uber and Careem.There are other positives as well. Women no longer have to wear the niqab in National ID card photographs. Tough anti harassment laws will protect offenders with 5 years in prison and SR 300,000 fine.How much further can Saudi Arabia go?We’ve mercifully avoided the hoary old women driver jokes until now. But believe me, even if we now have to suffer these, this will be a small price to pay for the freedom to drive our own lives forward."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/19/4D970F4300000578-5880399-image-a-10_1529863517560.jpg","title":"Princess Claire looks radiant Prince Felix celebrate Luxembourgs national day","story":"Princess Claire is smiling as she enters the Cathedral of Our Lady in Luxembourg with Prince Felix on national day          All eyes were on the colour-coordinated pair, who tied the knot in 2013, wearing baby blue and pink for Mass  Grand Duchess Stéphanie and Grand Duke Guillaume linked at the arm as they walk past a guard of honour          A beaming Grand Duke Guillaume is greeted by the Cathedral\u0027s priest ahead of national day Mass in the tiny European nationA party fit for a prince!

When she texted back to say he had messaged the wrong person he called her, quickly charming her with tales of his high-flying career as a pilot for the Emirates airline. The scam was a carbon copy of the trick he used to sweet-talk his earlier victims and soon she was seeing him every chance she could – with no idea he was a jailed criminal. Within months they had a wedding ceremony at an imam’s house in London.Yesterday his 34-year-old ‘bride’ told of her anger that Haider, a married father of one, could continue ‘messing with people’s lives’ even when in prison. She said he told her ‘nearly all’ of the inmates at HMP Hewell, have access to smuggled phones.‘We’d meet up when he was on weekend or home leave – and the rest of the time he told me he was working up north’, she said.‘I can’t understand how somebody like him is able to carry on like this from a prison. More needs to be done to weed phones out of jails. I feel like I was sharing a bed with a stranger.’ The orcee, who lives in a village outside Worcester, called for laws to force ‘emotional confidence tricksters’ such as Haider to declare new relationships after a conviction. ‘Sex offenders are subjected to stringent licensing conditions, where sexual harm prevention orders require them to declare new relationships which can help to protect new partners. But there is nothing to protect the public from people like Haider,’ she said. It was one of Haider’s lies that led the woman to find out he was a jailed criminal – just weeks before his release on licence this March. After telling her he was under investigation for tax fraud, she googled the lawyer he had mentioned. The man had been involved in Haider’s trial and the search revealed articles about the conman.          Haider with one of his unfortunate victims ‘When I discovered who he really was, I hoped he’d changed, she said. ‘Unfortunately he is just an inveterate liar who causes people severe emotional harm. Everybody in his life is just a cast member to him – he kills people off whenever it is convenient for the particular lie he is spinning.’She broke up with him last month, after discovering he had been messaging the second woman, 47. By then, she had spent around £4,000 on Haider – who failed to repay her. Both women believe he obtained their phone numbers while using online dating sites under a pseudonym.In 2015, Birmingham Crown Court heard Haider persuaded three women to part with savings or take out loans – with one handing over £52,000. He told all three victims he was a budding Emirates airline pilot – but he had never worked for the firm.Haider, from Acocks Green, Birmingham, refused to comment when asked about his conduct outside his home this week.A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Using a mobile phone in prison is a crime and anyone found doing so can spend significantly longer behind bars.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/22/4D98FC3A00000578-5880815-image-a-104_1529874250212.jpg","title":"The Mail secures UK passport 2 500 people smuggler","story":"    Abu Ahmad, who is known as ‘The Doctor’, helps smuggle people across the world by selling them stolen passportsAhmad sells 15 to 20 passports a month about five of which are British. ‘It’s a strong passport, the British one,’ he said.Because of extra security measures surrounding direct flights from Turkey to UK, buyers of British passports are told to first go to France and from there fly to Britain.‘Out of every ten at the airport, seven make it,’ he said. ‘There are people that get caught the first time in the airport. We’ll try again with them after four to five days.‘But many make it the first time. This goes back to how the person looks, how strong they are, their personality – if they know the language, that all affects how easy it is to move. \u0027The passport as well, if it’s legitimate, if the person looks like the picture, that all plays a role.’Ahmad offers three tiers of service. The cheapest, passport only, starts at £2,500, leaving the buyer to ‘sort himself out’ and try to reach a European Union country alone.For an extra £1,300 he arranges a Turkish entry stamp and pays off corrupt officials so that immigration records show the client had legitimately arrived in Turkey. The process takes ten days.The full-service package costs £7,000. Ahmad says: ‘It is a huge amount, but I arrange everything to help them leave. \u0027I book him a room in a hotel, I get them food, I get them a passport and entrance stamp and then when they leave they have to pay the money.‘Many people have never been to an airport before. The young man will check in for him, will guide him to security, then we’ll explain to him over the phone where to go until he reaches the gate.‘We’d have already explained to him any time he talks to us he should delete everything. Every time he contacts us, he has to delete it all from his phone.’Those making the trip on a fraudulent passport have a choice: either to pass through immigration control on arrival or claim asylum. Ahmad said: ‘If he looks a lot like the passport picture and he looks decent, he can land with it and pass through in a European airport.’          For £7,000 Ahmad books his client a hotel room, gets them food and hands over a stolen passport. This is the full-service package, with the cheapest being just the passport for £2,500If the client is planning to apply for asylum on arrival, he is told to go to the toilet on the plane and tear up the passport.‘We explain to him that once he arrives at the requested country, he shouldn’t hand himself in or leave immediately. He should hang around in transit for two to three hours, then he can go hand himself in or leave the airport,’ said Ahmad.‘We’d have already told him to not bring up that he came from Turkey. He should say he came from a different country. Egypt, Beirut, any other country besides Turkey.’Ahmad, a father of three, is a Palestinian-Syrian who studied medicine in Damascus and worked as heart doctor in the city’s Al Bassel Hospital before moving to Aleppo.He fled his homeland two years after the civil war broke out in 2011. ‘On our way to Greece we sank in the ocean,’ he said. ‘I spent 11 hours swimming and 140 people died. One of my friends drowned.‘The Turks caught us and saved us and brought us back here. I tried hard to leave for five to six months but it wouldn’t work for me. \u0027People started to know me, my friends and acquaintances, that I’ve been living in Turkey for a while.‘They want to migrate, so they’d call me and say we want to leave, what do you advise us?‘They trusted me because I am I doctor.

At its peak, his ‘business’ was bringing in £110,000 a month. Europol, an EU police agency, warned yesterday that people smugglers operating in Turkey and Greece were ‘frequent’ offenders in the trade in black market documents, which is an ‘important enabler’ of organised crime.Ahmad said all the passports he sold were genuine – otherwise they would be no use at border control.They are either stolen or sold by their owners, who agree not to report them as missing for a few months, by which time they have been used by Ahmad’s customers.He said: ‘Most British passports are stolen. Except if the passport was in the name of someone Arabic or Pakistani or something, that could have been sold.’Ahmad said he had no qualms about profiting from stolen passports and, despite boasting he has smuggled thousands of people into Britain, insisted he was certain none of them were jihadis or criminals.          Abu Ahmad, who is known as ‘The Doctor’, helps smuggle people across the world by selling them stolen passportsBut another Syrian immigrant in Turkey told the Mail at least two people Ahmad helped get into Europe were known Islamists operating in Damascus. The German authorities were alerted about them after their arrival, he said.Interpol, an international police agency, has a stolen and lost travel documents database, known as SLTD, which it says was searched more than 1.2billion times in the first nine months of 2016, providing 115,000 ‘hits’.But on its website, it admits: ‘Interpol is not automatically notified of all passport thefts occurring worldwide, and the SLTD database is not connected to national lists of stolen or lost passports.‘Despite the potential availability of the SLTD database, not all countries systematically search the database to determine whether an inidual is using a fraudulent passport.’          For £7,000 Ahmad books his client a hotel room, gets them food and hands over a stolen passport. This is the full-service package, with the cheapest being just the passport for £2,500In 2014, the head of the agency said just four in ten passports used for international flights were checked against the database.Labour MP John Woodcock, a member of the Commons home affairs committee, said: ‘At a time when several hundred potentially highly dangerous jihadis have fled when Islamic State has been deposed it’s highly alarming to learn that this way of entering the UK illegally seems to be so readily available.’Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, said: ‘Criminals who capitalise on the vulnerability of tourists and then profit off refugees and immigrants in desperate need of help must not be allowed to operate so freely.’David Lowe, a former Special Branch counter-terrorism officer now based at Leeds Beckett University, said: ‘For terrorists and criminals getting a new passport is like winning the lottery.‘It’s a significant concern with fighters coming from Islamic State or returning British fighters.

That will be bad for them in an era where we have got complex integrated supply chains.

And yesterday it emerged that he holds weekly meetings with a coalition of business lobby groups that have issued a fresh warning over Brexit to the Prime Minister.

This series, developed from a film entitled Outremonde (Underworld) after the novel by Don DeLillo, was produced during the two months that Henno lived in Slab City in 2017. Even in an apocalyptic nightmare, Henno finds light: Revon and Michael become friends, then lovers after she introduces them, and Dave, a former drug- and alcohol-addicted evangelical pastor, creates a community vegetable patch in the desert.“I went back after a year and the bus in the picture was burned and Revon and Michael had gone their separate ways but the garden was growing,” Henno says. “There were even tomatoes.

So the perfect person to write it, she decided, was her best friend, Yomi Adegoke, then also 22 and working at Channel 4. “Because Yomi’s a\u0026nbspjournalist, I thought she would write it and I would market it,” says Uviebinené. “But she sold the idea back to me to both write it together.”So that’s what they did. It did not matter that they were both working long hours in highly competitive careers – they wrote every evening and weekend for the next year. Nor that neither had written a book before – they simply Googled “how to write a book” and set up focus groups with friends to discover the breadth of what they needed to research.Taking the dictum to work twice as hard to get half as far as their white counterparts – which they believe is one of the only ways for black communities to succeed in Britain – they secured a book deal a year later, despite the outrageous odds against two black women with no inside connections to an overwhelmingly white, elitist publishing industry.It was not just any book deal either. Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible is arguably the book for 2018, fought for in a nine-way publishers’ auction with Uviebinené and Adegoke receiving – to their astonishment – a five-figure sum.Uviebinené was at work when she got the phone call from her agent. She hid in the office loos and made a breathless call to Adegoke. “I was trying to Whatsapp Yomi from the top of Canary Wharf tower, trying to explain what had just happened and I felt so overwhelmed.”Adegoke was celebrating her 25th birthday in Rio de Janeiro. “I had just broken up with a boyfriend and I wanted to go away after one year of working intensely. I was having a really great time and I’d lost my phone for the previous few days.”Both are 26 now. They met as 18-year-old freshers at the University of Warwick. There they found themselves marooned and misunderstood in an almost uniformly white environment that seemed unconsciously hostile. Adegoke took a year out from Warwick after suffering from depression (she turned this into a productive experience by founding a magazine titled Birthday).“Her confidence was mistaken for arrogance,” explains Uviebinené. “It was ‘us’ against everyone else.”“Yeah,” adds Adegoke, “We’ve both been through a lot. It’s one of the reasons we get on so well. There is a lot of respect there.”Both are of Nigerian heritage – Uviebinené’s father came to Britain when she was two (leaving behind her mother, from whom she is estranged) and she is the eldest of six children. Adegoke was born and raised in Croydon, south London, and has two sisters to whom she is very close. Uviebinené has become a kind of third sister: she moved in with Adegoke’s family in 2016 and has lived there since.The book looks at the mechanics of succeeding at school and in the workplace within a greater system that is structurally tilted against British black communities (they back this up with a barrage of statistical research). In it, they talk of the “concrete ceiling”, “impenetrable glasshouses”, the “long, back-door route into success” and of such flagrant bias at work that some black candidates have fared better by sending in job applications using aliases.They grapple with issues around health, dating and representation that are specific to black female experience. What is most impressive is the book’s penetrating research as well as its argument. “Well, if you are going to call a book ‘the black girl bible’, you have to do your research, and incorporate the full cross-section of black women’s concerns,” says Uviebinené.Adegoke nods vigorously. “In the past year and a half, our lives have been dedicated to making sure we get this right. It’s been the most challenging thing we’ve ever done. I don’t know that I would have a book deal without Elizabeth.”“We are each other’s champions,” Uviebinené shoots back. “Yomi is one of the most confident and articulate people I know.”There are many such tender exchanges. They are friends who seem more like sisters, though in temperament they are yin and yang. Uviebinené turns up bang on time and is calmly composed and earnest. Adegoke, who arrives late, is a whirlwind of energy. They do not talk over each other or finish each other’s sentences but seem to know what the other will say. Much of this sisterliness and fierce spirit of “strength in adversity” is channelled into their book. Uviebinené says it was written for her younger self, and all those girls and women who, like her in those formative years, are trying to figure out who they are in the world, and how they can succeed at life. “When I was 16, I’d write notes to myself every time things got hard on the type of person I wanted to be. I was always looking to what life held for me. So this book is about what I wanted to know when I was 16, and 18, and 21, that popular culture wasn’t telling me.” It also gives young black girls a host of role models or “cheerleaders” that the authors believe are badly needed. They interview 39 accomplished black women for their perspectives on success, from Malorie Blackman to Laura Mvula, June Sarpong, Denise Lewis, Jamelia, Margaret Busby and Estelle. Young girls need to “see it to be it”, they say, quoting Dr Karen Blackett, chair of MediaCom, from the book’s foreword, and such cheerleaders were not always visible while they were growing up.Uviebinené found inspiration in older women who accomplished great things, while for Adegoke, it came from closer to home. “My older sister, Yemisi, is a journalist for BBC Africa. She always told us dark skin was beautiful. She made sure we didn’t have issues around it. She was like a third parent, making sure we grew up confident.”Since Uviebinené’s lightbulb moment in 2015, the subject of ersity has exploded in publishing. Bestselling books by Reni Eddo-Lodge and Afua Hirsch have shown the industry that there is an immense appetite for a conversation around race and inequality in Britain.What do they feel about this moment? “Liz was trying to set the agenda, not follow it,” says Adegoke. “So we didn’t think: ‘This will work because black girls have traction right now.’”But they welcome the drive for better representation. “We see it as a blessing that our book has coincided with a trend for ersity,” says Adegoke. “We can see that just as it is in fashion now it can fall out of fashion. But then again, black women are not going anywhere. We don’t fall off the planet when we’re not in fashion. We’ll still here and we believe we’ve written a good book, and that people will read it, even if people get bored of ersity.”Is it relevant to non-black readers, too, and inspiring girls across the range? “I think non-black people should read it to understand the experience of what it means to be a black woman. I have been reading books that have not been written for me all my life,” says Adegoke.For Uviebinené, intersectionality is key in feminism: “You can sing from one voice but it’s also not as straightforward as that. You need to see your privilege for what it is first. Feminism for me is about gaining choices and breaking down the insidious structures that hold us back. White women tend to want to be more like white men in their privilege. I don’t want to be more like white women.”Do they think unequal structures are slowly being broken down, and that Britain is changing? After all, a mixed-race woman recently married into royalty. “I don’t think Meghan Markle massively marked a change. It’s Harry’s choice, not an institutional choice, though I do think she could be an agent of change for women,” says Adegoke. “But if Harry had brought home a girl who looked like us – black girls with kinky hair and big noses – it would be a very different conversation.”They swap a look again, a kind of signal that they have each other’s backs. What about boyfriends, I ask. Where do they sit within their friendship? “My boyfriend is basically a version of Liz – a short, dark-skinned Taurus.” Does he get on with Uviebinené? Adegoke shrugs as if this is a no-brainer. “They have to love her. Of course.”• Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke will join Afua Hirsch for a  Live event on Wednesday 25 July at Kings Place, London N1• Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible is published next month by Fourth Estate (£16.99).

Her 2011 nonfiction memoir How to Be a Woman is an international bestseller, while How to Build a Girl, the first novel in her semi-autobiographical trilogy about\u0026nbspa teenager called Johanna Morrigan, is being made into a feature film. Its sequel, How to Be Famous, is out on Thursday (Ebury Press, £14.99).This is your third book with a ‘how to’ title. How come?I like writing useful books. I didn’t go to school. Everything I learned was from reading everything that interested me in Wolverhampton’s Warstone’s library. With a “how to” title you know what you’re going to get. If you call it, like, The Crying of Dolphins, people think: “Hmm, is that relevant to me?” Every book of mine is a list of topics I haven’t seen addressed, taboos that need to be busted, secrets that need to be told, things that I want to boggle at. What is everybody else not talking about or too scared to talk\u0026nbspabout?Although your new novel, with its plot about a powerful man sexually exploiting younger women, is very in tune with what everyone’s talking\u0026nbspabout.Yes, imagine sitting here every day and going on Twitter and you’re like: “Shit, this is literally the plot to this book!” I’d had the idea for 10 years. It was always about sexual shame, a tape, and becoming famous for the wrong reasons. When something awful happens and you become news, how do you deal with that? Revenge porn is a huge thing now for younger women.\u0026nbspJohanna realises she needs to speak out. She’s saying: “Take your shame, it’s not mine.” And that was what the #MeToo movement was doing on a global scale. And it’s\u0026nbspworking! These fuckers are going to go to jail, it’s changing the industry.Johanna’s defiance seems to embody that of the #MeToo movement.What’s really important in the book is that Johanna would not be able to get to that defiance if she had not met Suzanne. Her friend Suzanne is older, she’s been through more, and she gives Johanna a platform. This is the thing that’s missing on social media, particularly in activism, it’s all young people with their anger. I wanted to write about female friendships and feminist mentors. We need more of that at the moment with activism. We tend to kill or ignore our tribal elders.Who is your feminist mentor?I loved Germaine Greer growing up – obviously she’s problematic now – but she wasn’t scared and I absolutely couldn’t imagine not being scared. Also when I was 17, Courtney Love took me under her wing – Suzanne is a bit based on her – I interviewed her a couple of times.Your books and your sitcom Raised By Wolves are based on your real life. Do you ever worry that you’ll run out of\u0026nbspmaterial?Within the panoply of fat, clever, working-class girls who really like to shag – I don’t think we’re overserved for those role models yet. Also, teenage girls are a cipher. Their concerns tell you precisely what the problems are with being an adult woman in any era. And right now, one in 10 teenage girls is being referred to mental health services. Girls are rejecting the idea of being an adult woman.Do you think it’s the worst time to be a teenage girl?We’ve heaped a whole load of pressure on these women. My generation had it easy. When I was a teenager the Berlin Wall had come down, we were all taking ecstasy and running around like Pac-Men in nightclubs going “everything’s going\u0026nbspto be great, hooray for liberalism”. We see these things being reversed now: the property and the jobs market have changed, there’s a rise in nationalism and\u0026nbsppopulism. The thing is, the internet foregrounds all of our disagreements and we don’t have anywhere where we see all of our progress. What’s your next book?A sequel to How to Be a Woman. I’m going to do trans issues, caring, mental illness, anxiety, ageing. I’m very excited.And how’s the film adaptation of How to Build a Girl going?It feels like a big fuss to make a film. When you’re writing a script, you’re writing about getting drunk on a bus. Some poor fucker is going to have to find a period-appropriate bus, clear a street, find actors... It’s such a hoo-ha. It’s really mortifying. But it is magic.Were you involved in the casting of Beanie Feldstein (the best friend in Greta Gerwig’s film Lady Bird) as you?Oh yes. The producers hadn’t been truthful with me that the chances of finding a big actress with the range to play a teenager who is clever, unusual and funny, but who’s also big enough to front a movie, were infinitesimal. We tend not to have big actresses, they just look at Hollywood and go, ‘Well there’s no point me being an actress. I’m just going to be the fat, funny friend.’ That she was invented just in time to do this movie is joyful. She’s going to be a huge star. She glows.What’s currently on your bedside table?I’m reading A History of God by Karen Armstrong. I’m working on a couple of projects where I look at the origins of God. Why did we invent\u0026nbspthis guy? And what’s his relevance now?Is there an author that you always return to?I reread The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole pretty much every year. It’s extraordinary. It’s that thing you see so often in female writers – Nina Stibbe’s another one – to write something light, brilliant and frothy is incredibly hard. It’s like making bread: you have to knead that fucking dough for a long time to make it light as a feather. Anyone can write a serious, miserable book.What book might people be surprised to find on your bookshelf?If they saw how badly I spelled, they’d probably be surprised that I have a dictionary. I still don’t really know\u0026nbspanything about grammar or\u0026nbspspelling.And they’re big on grammar at school these days.It breaks my heart. Some of my stuff is set texts at GCSE and A-level, so I get kids saying: “We’re analysing you today, why have you used a past participle there?” And I literally don’t have a clue. I learned to write by reading. I tell my kids there’s probably something in this house that will be more use to you than the stuff you’re learning at school.Are they fans of your work?No! Who wants to read their mum writing about masturbation? We did an Easter egg hunt and one of the clues was hidden in my book and they refused to open it. The shits.

Aside from the occasional bit of scatological humour (scatology being the study of faeces … delightful), most of us happily steer away from regularly talking about it, for fairly obvious reasons.But, if you push past the initial icky revulsion of talking about human waste, you’d find out that it actually contains a vast amount of potential value in terms of energy, providing a sustainable form of fuel that we could all help supply.In 2015, research by the United Nations University found that human waste was a potential fuel source and if all of it was collected worldwide, annually it would be “great enough in theory to generate electricity for up to 138m households” – which is all of Indonesia, Brazil, and Ethiopia combined. An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost $9.5bn (£6.7bn).Poo-powered innovations are already happening, too. Earlier this year, a Worcestershire man made headlines when, fed-up with seeing bags littered across the scenic Malvern Hills, he designed a street lamp that runs on dog poo – two hours of light for every 10 bags of poo.There are companies across the UK that are also starting to explore the potential of poo power on a larger scale. Bristol-based renewable energy company GENeco is using sewage waste from the city to create green gas, which is then supplied to homes across the UK by Bristol Energy.“When sewage waste arrives at GENeco’s treatment plant in Bristol, it is treated and turned into what’s called ‘sludge’,” explains Bristol Energy renewables and origination manager Simon Proctor. “This forms the raw fuel for the anaerobic digestion plant.”During anaerobic digestion, organic matter – in this case, the sewage sludge – is broken down by microorganisms in an airtight container Proctor compares it to “the way a cow’s stomach breaks down grass”.This process produces methane-rich biogas, which is treated to remove impurities and ensure emissions are odour-free. The enriched biomethane is then injected into the gas distribution network. “It has the same quality as natural gas, and can be used in our homes as an alternative to fossil fuels,” Proctor says.The results are impressive. According to Bristol Energy, an average household’s weekly flushes could produce enough biomethane to cook a fry-up two weeks’ flushes could cook a roast dinner and annual flushes from every household in Bristol could fry 83m eggs.Biomethane was also used as fuel by GENeco to run a “Bio-Bus” shuttle to and from Bath and Bristol airport and also on a regular bus service within Bristol, aptly named the “number two route”. The bus travelled more than 180 miles on a tank of gas produced by the annual food and sewage waste of just five passengers.Sustainability is at the heart of the entire process. “Producing biomethane from sewage waste means that we don’t have to use fossil fuels,” Proctor says. “Burning fossil fuels is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions in the UK. Switching the average UK home to renewable energy can save more than 1.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, that’s equivalent to taking a car off the road for six months.”He also points out that while we can try to reduce other forms of waste, such as packaging, plastic or food, reducing the level of sewage waste “is obviously going to be more difficult” – making the process an important step towards a more sustainable world.Bristol Energy will also invest its profits back into the city, creating what Proctor calls a “circular economy”. “Sewage waste from Bristol is recycled into green gas our customers switch to a locally owned company and save money – and then our profits will go back into the local community,” he says.That doesn’t mean there aren’t drawbacks, however, particularly in terms of the adoption of the process. Installation and maintenance costs for anaerobic digestion systems can be high, and many companies have been forced to rely on government initiatives to keep running. Proctor says that support under such schemes has been “very ambiguous at times”, which could be, in part, what is preventing more companies from adopting similar systems.Prof Chris Metcalfe, director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University in Canada, worked on the UN study into human waste. He believes that biogas should be considered a resource not only for energy production, but also as compost “for improving agricultural productivity” and for the recycling of water for irrigation.“In most cases, we’re wasting this resource by either putting the solids into landfill or by discharging the liquid sewage into lakes and rivers,” he says.The main issue, Metcalfe believes, is not the technology – in fact, he says there are no real technological barriers to the use of human waste as fuel. Instead, it’s “people’s attitudes about using human waste” that causes problems. “In many countries, the idea of collecting and using human waste is not culturally acceptable, even though animal manure is often used for biogas production,” Metcalfe explains.But Proctor says human waste is already being used more widely than we may think. This is evident across the world, where the process is increasingly being used to improve sanitation in developing countries. In India, where $20bn (around £14bn) of government funding has recently been put towards building sanitary toilets, social project SHRI (Sanitation and Health Rights India) uses an anaerobic biodisgestion system to provide electricity to pump ground water that is later filtered and sold, with profits paying for the ongoing maintenance of the toilets.It may not be glamorous, sexy or particularly futuristic it may still seem slightly icky. But it’s undeniable: whether it’s being used to fuel cars, buses or homes in the UK, or to improve sanitation conditions across the world, poo has the power to change lives.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48afcbc8d6037ad858fe4c2d6add236df4ed25f2/266_148_2719_1632/master/2719.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f986511bc8842235a76ea4c3770c6d47","title":"sir philip green came close to acquiring ms in 2004 book","story":"Former BHS owner had no idea how near he came to winning before he withdrewSir Philip Green, whose role in the demise of BHS was characterised by parliamentarians as the “unacceptable face of capitalism”, came much closer than previously thought to acquiring Marks \u0026amp Spencer in 2004, a book on the controversial billionaire claims.The news that the abrasive tycoon almost won the takeover battle for what many considered to be the jewel in the British high street will be regarded as a close escape by some in the retailing industry, many of whom have long bridled at the billionaire’s brusque nature and delighted in his humbling.At the time of his attempted M\u0026ampS takeover in 2004, Green was thought of as one of the kings of the British high street, having acquired the loss-making BHS for £200m in 2000 and quickly turning around the business.BHS was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt, for only £1 in March 2015. It collapsed in April 2016 with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit assessed at £571m.Since then, Green has had to fend off calls for him to be stripped of his knighthood and, following months of pressure, he agreed to hand over £363m in cash to rescue the bust retailer’s pension scheme.Aside from the M\u0026ampS near-miss, the book, Damaged Goods, by the Sunday Times business journalist Oliver Shah, also states that:Green had first attempted to acquire M\u0026ampS in 1999 but failed after it was revealed that his wife, Tina, had bought shares in the retail chain before news of the takeover was made public.“At that moment, Grant received a call from Kate Rankine, the Daily ’s deputy City editor. Rose instructed Grant to fob her off by saying there was no change in the board’s stance. Rankine, who was close to both Green and Rose, called Green and relayed the update. The M\u0026ampS board continued to debate the position fiercely. At 8.30pm, Robert Swannell, one of M\u0026ampS’s bankers, looked at his BlackBerry and announced: ‘It’s all academic now’ – Green had withdrawn. The message from Rankine seemed to have been the final ingredient that made him lose his nerve.”Green said he had not seen the book and did not want to comment on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/102d53bfd0710cb1f8e1d6a8056f930e97d6bbab/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=560e554c19ce3d5fbe6477fac4d39f0c","title":"ministers shake up contract bidding rules","story":"Government moves to rebuild trust and address criticism following Carillion collapse Measures to make it easier for small businesses, charities, co-operatives and social enterprises to bid for government contracts will be unveiled by ministers on Monday in an attempt to rebuild trust, following the collapse of Carillion.In the wake of criticism of the government’s handling of the outsourcing company, ministers plan to change the rules so that when companies are bidding for contracts, their “social values” will be taken into account, as well as whether they provide value for money for the taxpayer.Carillion, a building and services contractor, collapsed abruptly earlier this year with the loss of thousands of jobs. It recently emerged that taxpayers are expected to foot a bill of more than £150m.In a speech on Monday, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, will reinforce the government’s commitment to using the private sector to deliver public services such as running call centres, building railways or providing school meals. About £200bn a year is channelled to private companies providing public services.He will also say that there needs to be a more erse marketplace of companies bidding for official contracts.The planned measures would encourage and make it easier for small businesses, mutuals, charities, co-operatives and social enterprises to take on government contracts.“We will extend the requirements of the Social Value Act in central government to ensure all major procurements explicitly evaluate social value where appropriate, rather than just consider it. By doing so, we will ensure that contracts are awarded on the basis of more than just value for money, but a company’s values too, so that their actions in society are rightly recognised and rewarded,” Lidington will say in a speech at the thinktank Reform.The government will also outline how it intends to use its purchasing power to challenge suppliers to do better on equality and ersity. “We will now develop proposals for government’s biggest suppliers to publish data and provide action plans for how they plan to address key social issues and disparities such as ethnic minority representation, gender pay, and what they are doing to tackle the scourge of modern slavery,” Lidington will say.The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the announcement, saying that the collapse of Carillion “was a warning of the dangers of short-termism in public contracts”, and that it was vital to have a healthy, competitive and dynamic marketplace of suppliers of all sizes.It added: “So businesses will welcome a change of focus to long-term value rather than short-term costs in procurement, and its intention to reduce complexity and cost involved in bidding to allow more SMEs to compete for work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8eafcfde227909611dda61bb9af498d4ccc96f/0_1_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d23afbea9317b9be8d32f46628c8a65f","title":"ofgem appoints economist martin cave as chairman","story":"Decision comes as regulator prepares to impose price cap on energy billsA champion of price caps and a critic of suppliers’ behaviour has been chosen to lead the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem.In an effort to toughen up the watchdog, which has been criticised for being soft on energy firms, regulatory economist Martin Cave has been selected as the regulator’s new chair just months before it is due to impose a price cap on energy bills.A Whitehall source said: “This appointment would send a clear signal to retail energy bosses that the government wants a strong regulator to design and bring in the cap ahead of the winter and protect millions of households from unfair price rises.”The decision to appoint Cave, who is the preferred candidate of the business secretary, Greg Clark, makes clear there will be no rowing back on plans for a cap.Cave, who specialises in competition law, was deputy chair at the UK Competition Commission and deputy panel chair of the Competition and Markets Authority from 2012 to January this year. He was the competition watchdog’s lone voice arguing for a price cap, nearly a year before the Conservatives adopted the policy as a flagship election pledge.Cave is unlikely to receive a warm reception from the industry, which is lobbying Ofgem to minimise the cap’s impact on profits. He has previously accused energy companies of presiding over “a market for an essential service which is presently working very badly for most British households”.Cave also said that having many consumers paying hundreds of pounds more than others for their energy is causing severe harm. A cap should be brought in as soon as possible “to protect customers from further exploitation”, he urged last year.Cave said he hoped to use his new role to protect consumers during a period of upheaval for the industry, as more renewable power comes online, smart meters are installed in millions of homes and new technology is introduced.“Seismic change is afoot in this sector and I will work to ensure that the regulator continues to protect consumers while working with government and those across the sector to build an energy system fit for the future,” he added.Whether Cave can devise a cap that delivers Theresa May’s pledge of saving households£100 remains to be seen.British Gas, EDF, E.ON, Npower, SSE and ScottishPower have all announced price rises in recent months, several of which were branded unjustified by ministers and cited as evidence of the need for a cap.German firm Npower has the most expensive default tariff of the big six, at £1,230 for a household with typical electricity and gas consumption. Legislation supporting the cap is expected to receive royal assent before parliament breaks for the summer, with the measure due to take effect before the end of the year.Cave’s appointment will be subject to a hearing of MPs on 3 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c166d1a398c7f2322975ef555cfb0f3655f4a8c/0_52_4896_2939/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deafb4fb1f0c05b8209981988b001635","title":"uk focused firms have struggled since brexit vote kpmg analysis finds","story":"KPMG finds companies earning profits mostly abroad have benefited since EU referendumBusinesses that earn most of their profits abroad have benefited since the Brexit vote from an inflow of funds from investors at the expense of domestic companies that rely on sales in the UK, according to two separate analyses of the London stock market.In the two years since the EU referendum, the disparity between the share performances of companies that operate largely inside the UK and ones that repatriate profits from foreign subsidiaries has almost reached a record high, said the accountancy company KPMG.The trend has left the UK stock market lagging behind US and continental markets, which have soared in the past two years. Investors have pushed the FTSE 100 to a record high but the index is still only a few hundred points above its 1999 peak, while the Dow Jones is at 24,580 – more than double the level at the turn of the century. “The outlook for the next year may be more mixed. While the pound is expected to remain relatively weak, the prospect of an escalating trade war could hurt a significant proportion of our FTSE non-UK 50 constituents,” she said. “These companies are also potentially more vulnerable to a cliff-edge Brexit as they tend to have supply chains that are more deeply integrated with the EU.”Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said the biggest impact was on the retail sector.“The retail sector has come under pressure from higher labour costs, lower footfall and the relentless rise of digital shopping. The currency crunch didn’t cause these issues but it made life more difficult in already tough times for high street retail,” he said.“The best performing stocks since the Brexit vote have a distinctly metallic tint and that’s because mining companies have profited from a combination of lower sterling and higher commodity prices.”More broadly, UK investors have tended to buy shares in continental stock markets and New York.“Investors have been putting record amounts into funds of late but they have been pulling considerable chunks of money out of the UK. Since the EU referendum was announced, £7.9bn has been withdrawn from UK equity funds against a backdrop of £61bn being ploughed into investment funds more generally,” Khalaf said.“Particular flashpoints for withdrawals from UK equities occurred around the time of the referendum and the general election the following year, which suggests the investor exodus from the UK has been very much driven by political uncertainty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a273e05e3366059fafd51f60b64de432663ec4d/0_110_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01616cfd0dd770a114d118d9b6aaf01a","title":"steve bell razan al najjar cartoon guardian editor","story":"On Wednesday 6 June the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, rejected a cartoon submitted by Steve Bell, whose images have appeared in the  over the past 36 years. The decision enraged Bell, and he protested in two emails that he copied to all editorial staff. Inevitably the emails leaked and other media reported the row and published the rejected cartoon and the emails.Readers were soon asking about the episode. The atmosphere was cooler by the time I had separate exchanges with Viner and Bell, who both once again accepted with good grace the scrutiny that comes with having an independent readers’ editor around.Bell’s cartoon was his reaction to Israeli forces shooting dead Razan al-Najjar, a 21-year-old volunteer medic at the Gaza fence protest. The image was submitted by Bell late on the day of a meeting between Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Theresa May. The two are depicted seated in armchairs on either side of a fireplace in 10 Downing Street, their countries’ flags behind them. Netanyahu, grim, stares fixedly ahead. As often with Bell, May is shown as a creepy clown. Inside the fireplace between them is a head-and-shoulders image of Najjar, her red scarf in flames around her head. Eyes downcast, she may be smiling or grimacing. The caption reads: “In memory of Razan al-Najjar – not”.Viner tells me that the opinion page team “were united in considering the image that Steve had filed to be offensive, and I agreed with them. As the fire looked like an oven, it seemed clear that the cartoon conjured up an image of the Holocaust. I think the point that Steve was making – that the death of Razan al-Najjar hung over the meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and Theresa May – could easily have been made in a way that didn’t reference fire or ovens. In addition, I found the idea that Razan was burning after her death distasteful. She was a courageous and heroic woman, and suggesting that she, a Muslim, was burning in the afterlife – burning in hell – is offensive to her memory. The use of fire was unnecessary and confusing, since Razan was shot.”To Viner, the question was not what Bell intended, but how readers would view the image. She stood by the decision not to publish – “as editors we edit all the time. That’s the job.”The next day, Bell drew and filed a revised image, but to him it lacked the “conceptual coherence” of the original. Najjar is seen through the fence, in a gunsight’s crosshairs, and “the fireplace becomes a sort of TV screen as if viewed from an Israeli tank,” Bell explained.No revised cartoon appeared. Viner told me: “I would have much preferred that Steve amended the cartoon on the evening he filed it, but he filed too late for that and showed very little willingness to take account of the concerns raised or consider suggested edits, such as having Razan’s image in a frame on the mantelpiece or as a spectral figure hovering over the meeting. Steve then circulated the cartoon to the entire editorial staff – not the best way to negotiate, as he has acknowledged – and it subsequently appeared on several other sites to illustrate this row in the . An amended cartoon was then out of the question.”To Bell, the original cartoon was “a tribute to Razan al-Najjar, and part ironic as I don’t believe she is being remembered, particularly not in the context here depicted. She appears to be in flames, which is a symbolic immolation. I felt that any literal depiction of the exact way she died would be excessive and unnecessary. The flames are minimal and evoke a halo, rather than an actual burning.”Bell denied intent to conflate the issue at hand with the Holocaust. “I can see how that construction might be placed on the cartoon, but I cannot see it as appropriate or helpful. Such a meaning would have to be predicated on the assumption that “Netanyahu” and “Israeli flag” represent an entire race of people rather than the specific politician here described. What would be the point of such an allusion to the Holocaust? It would not help the cartoon, which is intended as a kind of memorial, in any way.”Bell expressed concern about what he called “a kind of growing visual prudishness”. He presented to me a perspective that I hope will give readers a sense of how tensions can arise between cartoonists and the editors who must take responsibility for publication.“Pictures are always open to interpretation, and that is one of the many things I love about them. After a career spent drawing often quite pointed cartoons, I find that I cherish ambiguity in a picture more and more. The fact that it is possible to build meaning in layers, and to have conflicting ideas within the same space is one of the strengths of the medium. A cartoon is not a photograph nor is it an editorial. There is always a straightforward, literal interpretation, and always a wide range of often contradictory, underlying allusions, evocations, references and metaphors.“I hope that with experience I have developed some skill in articulating these meanings, sometimes to comic effect, sometimes with ironic intent and sometimes (more rarely but just as significantly) as a direct appeal to emotion. This cartoon clearly falls into the latter category, which is why I was especially upset at its being spiked.”An ultimate decision-maker like Viner lacks the luxury of these gradations. If enough experienced and sensible people, with a feel for their audience and a taken-as-read appreciation for the role of satire in a free society, see in a cartoon a problematic allusion to the Holocaust, a leader listens, considers context, thinks about the inidual involved, and makes a judgment – often within a tight deadline.Intended or unintended, I believe that in this cartoon an allusion to the ovens of the concentration camps of the Holocaust is obvious. I don’t regard the image as antisemitic, which is important to state because Bell has been accused of it more than once before. Rather, I see the image as insensitively and counterproductively ill-judged.The Holocaust was a crime of a vastness hard to grasp – in its planning, execution and consequences. It is freighted with suffering still, and any rhetorical evocation of it, in words or images, requires great care and a sense of proportion.Rejection by Viner of this cartoon was not censorship or an unfortunate precedent, as Bell initially charged. It was the ordinary exercise of editorial power legitimately vested in Viner by the publisher of the . Bell himself acknowledges “no ine right to have my work published come what may”.I asked Bell if, by emailing the entire  editorial department and attaching the rejected cartoon, he had intended to leak it.“It was not my express or conscious intention to leak the cartoon into the wider world,” Bell replied. “I know very well that, while I have been published more or less every day in the  since 1981, there is no other daily paper that would touch me or my work with a bargepole, let alone allow me the degree of editorial freedom that I have experienced at the . I never seriously thought that another paper would dream of picking up this cartoon and running with it. In retrospect this attitude on my part may have been naive.”I would be naive if I did not ponder whether Bell is capable of being disingenuous.Flawed, like us all, Bell is a fine exponent of his artform, with a toughness that practising in the great English tradition of political cartooning undoubtedly requires.In this case I believe Bell delivered a clanger, amplified by the publicity his own actions prompted. It made Bell and potential antisemitism the story, and muted his cause, which I take to be a demand that Israel’s allies press it to explain the violent death of an articulate young woman who was just starting to come to attention.• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd2c234e07715da5df26ab9f5ccc2d1b59227e96/0_22_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78388f435ebd6849bd07bb63f11ef87a","title":"the guardian view on hyper populism its infecting politicians and technocrats","story":"It was Michael Gove who before the Brexit referendum said “people in this country have had enough of experts”. The highly educated Mr Gove was mining a rich seam of voters fed up with, and disregarding of, expert opinion. Brexiters have continued in this pejorative style. Only last week the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, reportedly gave a terse and pungent imprecation to diplomats who raised the issue of companies doubting his wisdom about the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal. “Fuck business,” Britain’s top diplomat replied undiplomatically.In fact both rabble-rousing Brexiters and experts have more in common than either would admit. Populists claim to have a special insight into the will of the people, able to dispense with debate and discussion. Hence Mr Johnson warning prime minister Theresa May against a “bog-roll Brexit” that was “soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long”. Technocrats also argue it’s necessary to insulate policies from political challenge. They want more independent agencies to take over arms of the state. This unfortunately has captured thinking in the UK, where the last few decades have seen a steady growth in the number of agencies, commissions and regulators which draft legally binding rules. These bodies provide a way for politicians to look as if they are doing something while allowing them to duck tough decisions until they cannot. Just look at public sector pay, which could only apparently be raised via independent pay review bodies – until politicians under pressure decided they were unnecessary.In an age of subdued economic growth, wage stagnation and a concentration of wealth among the very richest, it is not complete fantasy, as the former Bank of England official Paul Tucker, in his latest book Unelected Power, puts it, to see our democracy “flirting with a peculiar cocktail of hyper-politicised technocracy and hyper-politicised populism, each fuelling the other in attempts to maintain effective government and to re-establish majoritarian sensibility”. Mr Tucker’s hyper-politicised technocracy hovered into view last week when the head of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, responded in Govian terms to claims her inspection system is biased against schools serving white working-class communities. She claimed poorer, white students lacked the drive of migrants. Ms Spielman is a public servant who has the right to judge schools and teachers but not social groups. Continuing to do so risks her legitimacy with audiences that she needs.Unelected power is not new. Democracies have found ways of accommodating the military and the judiciary. Central banking has become part of that story. These power centres have realised that they cannot act in too overmighty a way, that circumstances and politics matter in a democracy and that people’s livelihoods cannot be sacrificed on the altar of intellectual purity. Over the years they have understood how important it is to respect voters and the deepest values that guide society. They did so through challenge. For an administrative state to truly work it will need councils to be reinvigorated, along with trade unions, cooperatives and civil society operating on the basis of more than single issues. Democratic societies must give people a voice as well as a vote. The public ought to be able to dissent on the grounds of their human, economic and social rights. If we forsake this approach then only two powers will remain: the state and the market. That is what the hyper-populists of politics and technocracy would want. Don’t let them have it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7818df2c1f85a045e74b64e9a6d885085b83372b/0_0_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a0c6ed61028481608a49393513a6ae","title":"coral reefs overwhelmed by rising oceans","story":"Scientists have uncovered a new threat to the world’s endangered coral reefs. They have found that most are incapable of growing quickly enough to compensate for rising sea levels triggered by global warming.The study suggests that reefs – which are already suffering serious degradation because the world’s seas are warming and becoming more acidic – could also become overwhelmed by rising oceans.Sea levels rose by several inches over the past century and measurements indicate the speed of this increase is now rising significantly. Two key factors are involved: climate change is making ocean water warmer and so it expands. And as ice sheets and glaciers melt, they increase amounts of water in the oceans.At the same time, reefs are being weakened by ocean warming and also by ocean acidification, triggered as more and more the seas absorb more and more carbon dioxide. These effects lead to bleaching events that kill off vast stretches of coral and limits their ability to grow.“Our predictions, even under the best case scenarios, suggest that by 2100 the inundation of reefs will expose coastal communities to significant threats of shoreline change,” said co-author Prof Peter Mumby of Queensland University.This point was backed by US marine scientist Ilsa Kuffner writing in a separate comment piece for Nature. “The implications of the study are dire.

The opposition will not always be this obliging and nobody, surely, can expect Harry Kane to keep scoring so prodigiously throughout the rest of the World Cup. Maybe England have peaked too soon. And no doubt the most overheard line over the coming days will be that, yes, it was only Panama. Stay calm, it was only Panama.All the same, it was difficult to come away from this freewheeling win for Gareth Southgate’s increasingly convincing side without the overwhelming feeling that it has been a long time since an England team have played this freely.It was their biggest World Cup victory and at half-time, no kidding, there were people in the press box flicking through the history books to find out how many more goals were needed to establish the biggest ever win in the history of this competition.England were 5-0 ahead at that stage courtesy of two penalties from Kane, a pair of headed goals from John Stones and a beauty from Jesse Lingard. Kane’s hat-trick followed in the 63rd minute and, after that, it came as a jolt that the only other goal was delivered by a Panamanian boot.Hungary’s 10-1 win against El Salvador in 1982 will have to be a target for another day. Thursday, perhaps, when Belgium are the opposition, to establish which team wins Group G.Already, it is mission accomplished as far as qualification is concerned and, on this evidence, it is no exaggeration to say England should not fear anybody in the knockout stages.Kane is now the leading scorer in the tournament, with five goals, and Gary Lineker is the only player, through all the ages, who has accumulated more World Cup goals for England. Yet the acclaim here should not just apply to the Tottenham striker when Stones has been so effective, when Kieran Trippier’s supply line has been so instrumental, and Lingard is emerging as a genuine category-A player.England had not scored five first-half goals in any game since doing just that against Luxembourg in 1999, and it is only the third time since 1950, out of 24 attempts, they have begun a major tournament by winning back-to-back matches, emulating the World Cups of 1982 and 2006. It is still only two games but something important is happening. England are becoming the team their supporters want them to be. And it is great fun.Panama’s ordeal did at least include the consolation of a 76th-minute goal and their supporters were still partying at the end. Ultimately, though, the imbalance of talent was far too great for a team fielding four players from Major League Soccer and others from the Romanian and Slovakian leagues. Panama had to resort to other measures. They argued with the officials. Their goalkeeper, Jaime Penedo, seemed to be threatening a one-man protest before Kane’s first penalty, and it was incredible, in particular, to see their tactics from England’s corners.Even by modern standards, has there ever been another set of players so dedicated to restricting the mobility of their opponents? Their approach led to Kane’s penalty, to make it 5-0, when Aníbal Godoy manhandled him to the floor. Yet that was the norm, rather than the exception, for every corner and an argument could be made that Panama also got their just deserts for the opening goal.For that one, Harry Maguire was brought to his knees twice because of Gabriel Gómez’s attempts to pin him down. Godoy was clinging to Kane like a mollusc on the side of a ship. Twice, the corner had to be delayed to sort out the chaos. Nobody, however, seemed to designate Stones as a potential danger. Trippier swung the ball over from the right and Stones powered in his header from eight yards.Even by that early stage, eight minutes in, it had become clear it was going to be harder to like this Panama team than many of us imagined. Indeed, England ought to have had a penalty inside 90 seconds after Gómez swung an elbow into Lingard’s jaw. Gómez, a repeat offender, went down clutching his own face and the Egyptian referee, Gehad Grisha, was taken in by the deception. Later, an elbow from Armando Cooper bloodied Maguire’s nose. Román Torres responded to Maguire’s complaints by flicking his opponent’s nose and pushing in his forehead in the manner of a rutting stag. Southgate had told his players not to react to any provocation and they did not let him down.Instead, this was a performance that brought to mind the old line from Frank Sinatra that the best revenge is massive success. Kane’s first penalty came from Fidel Escobar bundling over the energetic and elusive Lingard. Kane struck the ball high, to the goalkeeper’s right, in a style reminiscent of Alan Shearer. For good measure, he did the same for the fifth goal.Lingard’s was the pick of them all, exchanging passes with Raheem Sterling before running across the line of the penalty area, left to right, and curling a shot that went in off the underside of the crossbar. Yet the fourth goal was brilliantly worked, too. This time, Trippier played a free-kick short to Henderson. A first-time cross was headed down by Kane and Stones put in the rebound after Penedo had blocked Sterling’s close-range effort.The second half was an exercise in damage limitation for Panama and, to give them their due, Kane’s hat-trick goal was a fluke, Ruben Loftus-Cheek letting fly from 20 yards and the ball striking his teammate on the heel to loop in.England’s lingering imperfections were briefly exposed when Felipe Baloy, one of Panama’s substitutes, turned in a free-kick with an outstretched leg. Yet Southgate and his players can still enjoy the view from the top of Group G, with the same points and goal difference as Belgium but ahead on fair-play rules, and the manager was pumping his fists at the end, no matter that it was only a few days since he dislocated his shoulder. Nobody should get too carried away but, good heavens, it can be hard sometimes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe3dbd28c6c5ed2ca4c36bde0d5a102e28172d2/16_20_4240_2543/master/4240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb8720c6bf3644ef5417726cde722416","title":"gareth southgate we would not swap harry kane for anyone","story":"Gareth Southgate has called Harry Kane “irreplaceable” and praised the striker’s mental strength, selfless work ethic and ruthless finishing after the captain scored England’s first World Cup hat-trick for 32 years to help propel the team into the knockout phase.Kane moved clear of Cristiano Ronaldo and Romelu Lukaku in the race for the Golden Boot by taking his tournament tally to five in a 6-1 thrashing of Panama, England’s biggest win at the finals, despite having played only 153 minutes. Only Gary Lineker has scored more times for the national side at the finals. Kane departed clutching the match ball and with his team safely through to the last 16 with Thursday’s final group game against Belgium to come.The 24-year-old has made no secret of his desire to establish his reputation alongside players such as Ronaldo and Lionel Messi at this tournament. “Clearly the stage to do that is this one,” said Southgate. “He’s started brilliantly. The penalty … you can dismiss penalties as easy, but the length of time he had to wait and the number of distractions which made him refocus and start again that tells you about the mental toughness he has got.“He’s there in the scoring charts. He’s up at the top. We wouldn’t swap him for anyone in the tournament in terms of No 9s because you know that, when he gets opportunities, he’ll bury them. Just as important is the way he presses, holds the ball up, contributes to the overall game, and sacrifices himself for the team.”Southgate intends to freshen up his side on Thursday, when leadership of Group G will be determined, but will seek to maintain “squad harmony” when it comes to selection for the game in Kaliningrad. The manager spent the entirety of England’s 2002 World Cup campaign unused by Sven-Göran Eriksson and, despite too many changes potentially disrupting rhythm, is reluctant to put his fringe players through similar frustration.“Over the next 36 hours or so we have to decide what our priority is and, for me, the harmony of the group is very high on that list,” said Southgate, who allayed fears over Kieran Trippier’s fitness and hopes to have Dele Alli available against Belgium. “Before the tournament we had a good performance against Costa Rica with a different XI to those who played against Nigeria a few days earlier. I have complete trust in all the players. We’d look a bit different because of the profile of players in certain positions but I know we’ll get a high level of performance. At this moment my thoughts are with the players who haven’t played as much, but I have to consider everything before I decide upon my team.“The harmony of the group is important to me. The three players we brought on today are really critical in terms of what we do in training and for their enthusiasm around the group. There are others who we didn’t get into the game. Some have been a couple of weeks without a match and we’re going to need more people ready as we get further into the tournament. But we want to keep playing well and keep the consistency in our play, too to keep the momentum going and keep progressing as a team.“We have to make the players who haven’t played matches feel valued. Their approach to training, their intensity, meant we were ready for this game. If that was to dip, we’d be nowhere near as effective.“I’m pleased for the squad and the staff today. I’ve heard talk of it being better finishing second but how do you work all that out, really? Let’s go and enjoy it again. It’s nice, it’s a game where we’re not up to our neck in pressure, but we also want to keep winning football matches. It’s a nice decision to have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a88b2ae71daa2abe0821ad1137a340fb5141a50/0_44_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e47371abda5a03fd5dd86c3fa177ebdc","title":"japan senegal world cup match report","story":"Japan have taken their oldest ever World Cup squad to Russia and all that experience counted for something as they summoned the spirit and attacking intuition to twice drag themselves back into a match that challenged them in every way.There had been many a cliche about the stylistic difference between African and Asian football in the pre-match discourse, but Japan’s determination to compete first and then break with conviction was a great leveller.Senegal’s manager, Aliou Cissé, never really bought the idea that physical power would be the great advantage it was cracked up to be, and Japan’s efforts, their confidence that they could find a way for their own talents to make a difference, pushed them towards another promising result.Control of Group H – whose qualifiers will meet England and Belgium from Group G in the knockouts – was at stake, and at the end of this topsy-turvy encounter nobody was any the wiser who progress, even though this draw keeps both teams tied on top of the group for now.Senegal regretted an opportunity missed from a display where they did not hit full stride.“Honestly we are all a bit disappointed,” said Sadio Mané, who opened the scoring early but by the end of it all could not hide the feeling that his team took a step back after the positivity of a stylish victory in their opening group game.Cissé could not quite put his finger on the reasons, but he admitted this was not the performance for which he was hoping. “Of course we have regrets but I must say we didn’t see a great Senegal team,” he said. “What I know is that at this level of competition with the players we have here, players who play at world level, we conceded two avoidable goals and we were not very good. The best team, I must admit, was Japan.”The best team drew. But if Senegal want to take one consolation from the match it is that Japan created the chances to win late on as they finished in the ascendancy.“Big and strong doesn’t really mean much in football. When it comes to speed and shots the Japanese were very good. I didn’t see much physical differences, commitment levels were 5050,” noted Cissé. That said, Japan did look a little overawed at the start, standing off any Senegalese advances, and it took only 11 minutes for Japan’s defence to panic and Mané to be the grateful beneficiary.Genki Haraguchi tried to clear a cross but could only glance a backward header weakly into Youssouf Sabaly’s path. His shot was parried by Japan’s goalkeeper, Eiji Kawashima, straight to the lurking Mané. Liverpool’s attacker didn’t have to do anything except be in the right place at the right time. The ball simply bounced off him and in.Japan’s equaliser came with a sudden flash of neat, precise football. Yuto Nagatomo burst into the box and controlled a long pass, dinking on for Takashi Inui to set himself to curl a low shot past Kadim Ndiaye. They really grew into the game and conjured two brilliant opportunities to take the lead around the hour mark. So close, but Yuya Osako could only fresh-air kick when he was through, and Inui cracked a shot against the crossbar.Senegal pulled themselves together and found a moment to express themselves. Mané instigated it all, delaying and cajoling until he found Sabaly running into space. The Bordeaux man danced into position and drilled the ball across goal for Moussa Wagué to hammer in from an acute angle.Japan again fought their way back into the game. This time Ndiaye, Senegal’s goalkeeper, had a moment to forget as he flapped at a cross, Inui drove the loose ball back, and Keisuke Honda seized the moment to pick his spot.“We came back from behind twice and each time after conceding the team was calm,” said Akira Nishino. “We could play in our own rhythm, our own way. After we won the first match we wanted to be aggressive towards the second match. We got a point. The result we had is going to have a very positive impact on the third match.”Overall, Senegal missed some accuracy in their final ball around the box, and Cissé wants them to refocus ahead of the final group game.“We need to improve the impact, more aggression on the ball. We need to have more concentration. We were getting the ball then losing it,” said Cissé. “There were lot of technical errors – too many. We didn’t play a great game but we didn’t lose.“We hope to qualify. We have to be concentrated and believe in it. The last day is going to be hard fought.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e578e90fc602f33e1add1fafa611e310ec3cfd50/4_182_2410_1446/master/2410.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0841861c76a85e62959ef6f085566b4","title":"panama england felipe baloy scores whole country explodes","story":"5am, around the Rommel Fernández Stadium. An unusual encounter on the Vía España for a Sunday before dawn. On the one hand there are those who got up early, gathered in groups of friends and families on the other night owls who come from nightclubs and bars celebrating their Panamanian Saturday night fever, as a preamble to a historic event: the confrontation of the “Sele” with the inventors of football – the English.6am, dawn in Panama and the stadium’s parking lot begins to fill to the sound of the Dianas, a tribute to the homeland that combines military rigidity and popular music. Street vendors rush to sell breakfast: hojaldras, carimañolas or tortillas, which they deliver to their customers in napkins and paper bags. The time is approaching.7am, the referee’s whistle. The game starts, Panamanians shout, the grey sky threatens rain. Go Panama!The dream of repeating the goalless first half against Belgium lasts eight minutes. The English navy, led by Kane, Stones and Lingard, guns the Panamanian goal six times, proving that their gunpowder is still as powerful as Henry Morgan’s in 1671.As if that were not enough, at the 20-minute mark a torrential and early rain, typical of the winter season, threatens to end the party. But far from dampening the spirits of the local fans, it excites them, as if it were the carnival culecos that hose revellers with water.Half-time arrives. There are sore throats from shouting for Panama, despite the score. Russia is felt here. The country is breathing and sweating its first World Cup.The Sele improve in the second half and England, secure in their superiority, allow the Panamanian players to enjoy their football.

Beer flies through the air in the Rommel Fernández Stadium parking lot. Several thousand people jump, celebrate, kiss and hug while Felipe Baloy’s goal is repeated over and over again on a giant screen.They have just forgotten in a stroke the six England goals. The score in the hearts of the Panamanians is 1-0 to La Marea Roja. Baloy is the new hero.Messages on WhatsApp begin to arrive, together with memes and videos. Panamanians celebrate wherever they are: in Russia, in Rommel Fernández, in Taberna 21, on the beach, in bed. This morning even the most fanatical baseball fans in Panama wear red.The final whistle. A red tide of people head home, happy, satisfied. Panama has fulfilled its role, has stood up to Belgium and scored against England. The next dream?

Rather than asking whether he should play James Rodríguez – now he was sufficiently recovered from his calf injury to start – or Juan Quintero, and coming up with a fairly obvious response, José Pékerman selected both and was rewarded not merely with a result that keeps alive Colombia’s hopes of making the last 16, but with a performance that made them look like a side that could go a long, long way in the tournament.Rodríguez and Quintero are contrasting No 10s, the modern dynamic runner and the more traditional variant, to be celebrated, perhaps, for what might most politely be referred to as his cerebral approach and economy of movement. Playing them together seemed a major risk, but along with Juan Cuadrado, Colombia’s creative trident picked Poland apart with clinical beauty. “More than once we felt that combination could be a good one,” said Pékerman. “They are two players with extraordinary talent. Tonight they contributed these great talents and played in a very complementary fashion.”On loan at River Plate from Porto, Quintero is a throwback, more cask than six-pack in tone, a player whose reluctance to submit to the more rigorous aspects of professionalism has frustrated a series of coaches. He had already played one astute reverse pass when, after 40 minutes, he played another to find Rodríguez in space on the right. His cross was perfect, and Yerry Mina nodded in from close range. Given he has only completed 90 minutes twice this year, it was no great surprise that Quintero was taken off after 73 minutes but before he went, he played in Radamel Falcao to score with an incisive prod of his left foot. A brilliant Rodríguez pass laid on the third for Cuadrado, who also had a fine game, attacking the space behind the Poland wing-back Maciej Rybus.Pékerman dedicated the victory to Carlos Sánchez, who was sent off in the opening defeat to Japan. Although he refused to confirm whether the former Aston Villa midfielder had received death threats, as has been reported, he did say Sánchez had been “deeply affected”. “I think we all understand that football really is something else. It is ultimately a game we play with a lot of responsibility, dedication and effort and so forth, but these things shouldn’t be said lightly.”Pékerman took responsibility himself for the Japan defeat, admitting he had “made mistakes”. With the combination of Quintero and Rodríguez, though, they had found a way of playing that was “close to the goal of how we wanted to play.” This was probably Colombia’s best performance since the last World Cup Pékerman sides are always at their best when counterattacking with rapid, precise geometry.Poland, unfortunately, continue to be at their best when they are not in tournaments. Adam Nawalka’s switch to a back three, although he had trialled it in the pre-tournament friendly against Nigeria, seemed in retrospect a warning. All through qualifying he had used either a 4-4-2 or 4-2-3-1 this was a sign that that team was effectively over and that, at the worst possible time, he was trying to forge a new one. As he sat helpless in the face of a barrage of hostile questions from the Polish media, the celebrations of Colombia fans clearly audible from outside the stadium, he did his best to defend the indefensible, insisting Poland had simply been beaten by the better side. That may be true, but it’s equally true that Poland were a better side in qualifying.Tactically, perhaps, setting a wing-back in Rybus against Cuadrado was a risk, and one that didn’t come close to paying off, but Poland’s struggles were about far more than that. There was a strange lifelessness about them while Robert Lewandowksi, who had seemed out of sorts towards the end of the season, most notably in the Champions League semi-final, was again listless, nothing like the figure who scored 16 goals in qualifying.For Poland the pattern is frustratingly familiar at major tournaments, and has been since 1982. They qualify well, hopes are raised and then they find that on the highest stage the shirt hangs heavy, players lose faith in what got them there and the result is a safety-first style that results in grouchiness and early exits.Colombia, meanwhile, fight on. Unless Poland do them an unlikely favour by beating Japan they will probably have to beat Senegal to qualify, but at least now there is hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82a70a50d53aed2a7f03563803beafe6c4bfc9e3/0_387_3868_2321/master/3868.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0b0c6f6bc9cc8119a09151e8d353113","title":"england score six senegal miss a chance and swiss gestures world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s crushing 6-1 win over Panama, Senegal being pegged back by Japan, Swiss gestures, Kerry Katona and bad hat-tricks"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0f52d4da21a9b38e56faf5fc61cf960492f958a/0_212_3386_2032/master/3386.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9321154d9d36f0f94ba794266fc06292","title":"blissed out gary lineker equal match rio ferdinand","story":"England’s glorious day in the sun lifted the BBC pundits but there was still caution amid the commotionComplain about the licence fee if you must but the bottom line is the BBC’s comprehensive World Cup coverage offers something for everyone. Toddlers across the land, for example, have been cavorting joyously to the simple pleasure of the Kicky Kicky Kick Kick song from\u0026nbspthe Hey Duggee cartoon. Meanwhile on Radio\u0026nbsp5\u0026nbspLive there is the Robbie Savage breakfast show, for those who have not yet graduated to CBeebies.It is a broad church. But the actual match coverage must please everyone at once, no mean feat. England’s support can be roughly split into two categories – the blindly optimistic and the morbidly fatalistic – and before the game Gary\u0026nbspLineker did his best to cater for both sets in one breath. “You can never guarantee anything, certainly with England. I remember two years ago! But Panama are one of the weakest teams in the tournament, so\u0026nbspsurely\u0026nbsp...” As he trailed off, the panel of Alan Shearer, Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand filled dead air with nervous laughter.There were more uneasy smiles to follow. Back in the innocent 1980s exotic broadcasting yuks were guaranteed simply by airing recordings of South American commentators performing elongated\u0026nbspcelebratory ululations. Gooooal! And to think at the time we\u0026nbspthought it would never get old.\u0026nbspThe modern equivalent is footage of studio-based buffoonery,\u0026nbspas presenters worldwide channel their\u0026nbspinner toolkit.The other day several Argentinians held a minute’s silence on TV for the risible\u0026nbspstate of the Albiceleste now a couple of Panamanian presenters hollered, sobbed and ostentatiously hugged during their national anthem. Goodness knows what mania was reached once the match\u0026nbspstarted.Those guys! Cut back to Lineker and a starch-stiff Shearer, up off their chairs in an awkward satirical embrace. The caper, which proved that physical comedy is not half as easy as the Iranian throw-in expert Milad Mohammadi makes it look, generated one single uncertain guffaw, coughed up by Lampard out of politeness and embarrassment. Best leave the hugs to Duggee.The grinning was less forced at half-time, a natural response to England breaking 68 years’ worth of scoring records in 45 psychedelic minutes. “Blimey,” was Lineker’s one-word, blissed‑out reaction, a masterclass in British understatement. Shearer could not disguise his glee, which was fair enough given the circumstances. Ferdinand was a tad more circumspect, pointing out that Panama were “not even non‑league”, the sort of no-nonsense, keep-it-real, we’ve-won-nothing-yet analysis one would expect from a man who during his career had regularly to meet professional standards set by a certain ITV pundit. Should we get excited, Rio? “We should be pleased.” Roy will be proud.Still, six goals at a World Cup! Whatever happens from here, Gareth has earned his football badge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e50d56a2fae65e6f1cacddd2747a4b7da69ef83/0_251_4792_2875/master/4792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9654511edd8d30a95ccf6d7c262c2db8","title":"jesse lingard england panama world cup","story":"Tireless midfielder is becoming the grinning symbol of a team that has come to Russia with a strange sense of exuberanceWell, that was fun, in between the painful bits. First, it is necessary to issue the disclaimers. Yes, Panama unravelled like a cheap cigar in Nizhny Novgorod. Faced with England’s excellent first-half movement, they fell apart like a wicker-rimmed hat left to bake in the sun. At times Panama played a genuinely ugly brand of football, hacking and whingeing and spoiling like the bloke you never invite back to the midweek seven-a-side.In between this England performed with incisive, cold-blooded composure to win 6-1 and rack up their highest World Cup score, an unarguable, entirely deserved entry in the tournament history books for this well-drilled and highly mobile team.Albeit they did so against opponents who were often wretched, the poverty of Panama’s play raising questions about the upshot of opening the great competition up to more nations in the chase for cash.It was not just the fouling and moaning. Although it was mainly the fouling and moaning. It was also the self-defeating nature of it all. Panama can play, as they showed here at times. But they came to spoil. Before the World Cup opener in Moscow at least one Russian volunteer could be seen lurking on the main concourse with a sign reading “Free Hugs”. Perhaps Panama should try something similar pre-match just to get it out of their system, so irresistible was the urge to grip and grapple and grasp, a ludicrous pantomime of man-on-man hug‑action that led directly to two first‑half goals.Enough of that, though. England were the story here, producing the one thing that has been missing in the orderly progress of the last year or so: a ballsy, freewheeling all-out thumping of game but moderate opposition.Harry Kane had a wonderful time when he wasn’t being strangled. This was not one of the classic hat‑tricks, comprising two wonderfully ked penalty kicks and a deflection Kane knew nothing about. But he ran off to safety 18 minutes after half‑time with five goals in 1.75 World Cup games, equal with Geoff Hurst as England second all-time scorer in the competition, behind Gary Lineker with 10.Kane will take the headlines. But it was a wonderful afternoon also for Jesse Lingard, who will long remember Panama, possibly even after the bruises have faded. Revenge is best served cold. That was never likely to happen for Lingard on an afternoon where the air inside the stadium sat like a steam-cooker, the kind of drowsy, heavy heat that hits you in the chest and sinks down into the lungs.But Lingard did something excellent here, responding to some blunt and painful treatment by running harder, playing with more rather than less verve on the half‑spin in those forward positions and helping to kill the game in the first half.The Nizhny Novgorod Stadium is another Russian mega-drome, beached on its side like an enormous white Wagon Wheel. England’s fans had staked out their upper tiers with a row of flags hanging limp from the railings, the usual tour of the Isles from Bury to Stoke to Southampton and Hull. What followed was glorious reward for all that travel and expense, the post-Marseilles anxiety, the constant boisterous support.It was reward, too, for Lingard, who is not the flashiest player nor an obvious star on the stats. Yet he has become one of Gareth Southgate’s reliables, an ever-willing runner with a fine touch and the occasional moment of brilliance.Some have sneered at his fun, extrovert persona, his groovy range of celebrations (there was a little Fortnite nod here). But look past the tribal stuff and Lingard is also something uplifting: an academy kid living the dream, wringing every last drop of life and joy from a starring role for his boyhood mega-club, now doing the same in front of the world in an England shirt.His first act was to find himself chopped to the floor in the Panama area by an expert short-arm elbow from Gabriel Gómez. Lingard felt his cheek and got on with it. Moments later Armando Cooper dragged him down with the kind of no-you-don’t-son hack familiar to desperate Sunday league players everywhere.England had just taken the lead, John Stones heading in powerfully after a ludicrous triple-tag wrestling bout at a corner had made the space. By which point Gómez had taken it upon himself to follow Lingard everywhere, but he was notably absent as his man sprinted on to Jordan Henderson’s pass and was bundled down Román Torres and Fidel Escobar in the area. Kane buried the kick.Peak Lingard arrived after 36 minutes, revenge for that throbbing cheek fully realised with a lovely goal to make it 3-0. It was a familiar Lingard move too, a turn and spring, taking the ball in his stride in space and producing a sublime curling shot on the run into the far corner of the net.Stones and Kane scored again. Panama pulled themselves together and were gracious in defeat, Hernán Darío Gómez coming across after half-time to offer warm congratulations to Southgate.For now Kane, Lingard and the travelling support will always have Nizhny Novgorod and a gloriously fun shellacking of a third-tier minnow that still felt significant. Yes, England have yet to play a half-decent opponent here, and could yet bomb out horribly when they do.But who cares, really? Compare this with the paralysing horror, the fear, the constipated style of the last five tournaments. England did not expect. They came to Russia with no real sense of hope, but with a gathering affection for this team and the admirable Southgate. They are already in credit. This was free. This was fun. This was a day that felt like a quiet kind of redemption whatever happens next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0073ae6d89858ae8f28f4082fe9cf63f8314e7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4823aa293b457f603de5ae7e9c337bd8","title":"golden boot standings top scorers for russia 2018 world cup","story":"The first official Fifa World Cup award for the player to score the most goals in the competition went to Paolo Rossi in 1982.

She talks to Eva Wiseman about the ‘magic energy’ that drives her and how she’s finally learning to make sense of herselfThere was a time when the voice of Florence Welch was as inescapable as an ambulance siren. “You’ve got the love, youuuu…” It blasted from car windows, it shot over sporting montages, it echoed through Primark. And then, just as quickly, it was gone.Now 31, her hair less roaring fire, more gentle sunset, Florence Welch is a calmer woman than the whirling girl behind three number one albums who headlined Glastonbury in a silver suit. Today, removing her jewellery so as not to jangle over the tape recorder, she looks like the Lady of Shalott in blue jeans. It was during that everywhere period, when Welch could hear herself coming every time she stepped out of the house, that she started to crack, slightly.“That’s when the drinking and the partying exploded, as a way to hide from it. I was drunk a lot of the time, on extra dirty Martinis – my way of drinking three shots at once. I was never interested in,” and she laughs, bitterly, “a nice glass of wine.” She says the phrase as if it were an urban myth she had always enjoyed a party. It was in the toilets of a London nightclub that, in 2006, she auditioned in front of her now-manager, becoming Florence and the Machine and breaking America three years later. In that period she rarely slept. When she got home after a two-day party, she was always in trouble. She’d get a text, typically, “Where RU?” “And I’d be like, ‘I’m not quite sure, but I’m wearing someone else’s clothes…’ The partying was about me not wanting to deal with the fact my life had changed, not wanting to come down. It always felt like something had picked me up and thrown me around various rooms and houses, then gone ‘boom!’” She flings her arms out theatrically. “It happened every time, and every time it was shocking.”But still, the music came, these huge bloody songs about love and loss – the director Greta Gerwig described them to Welch as “the deepest, darkest well of pain, and then you just throw a big party in there and invite everybody”. It makes Gerwig cry, she admitted, uncontrollably. The sound took some time to shape – it wasn’t until she started making music with another young woman, Isa Summers, that they emerged with the single Dog Days Are Over, a huge Kate Bush-ian snarl of a pop song that came to define her. Until then she’d been working with older male producers. “And there was an unconscious deferral, a bias against myself that felt ingrained.” Four albums in, she’s still making music the same controlled, “feminine” way, the only difference being today she knows when to take things out. “When it’s too… Florencey?” I nod then stop, for fear of seeming rude.As she approached the 10th anniversary of this career that became very big very fast, she decided to sober up. “When I realised I could perform without the booze it was a revelation. There’s discomfort and rage, and the moment when they meet is when you break open. You’re free.”On stage, she says, she always felt absolved – nobody was angry with her up there. It was her offstage life that she had to work on. Up there she will climb the scaffolding, holding on with one hand, leaping into the crowd and ripping her top off when she gets too sweaty. After those nights it’s quite hard for her to return to earth. Everything, she explains, starts to take on a magical significance. There will be moments – sitting in a friend’s room watching TV, for instance – when, sleep-deprived and sober, she will be suddenly awed. “Mundane moments become incredibly profound. The performing, the transcendence, then sitting watching TV – all can coexist, and the mundane makes the magical. Maybe I’m trying to hold on to normalcy. Maybe because being onstage has become normal, the pockets of peace seem really wild. But I treasure them.”So she stopped drinking and she started staying in, and last night she watched the entire new series of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. “I think I reached the bottom of Netflix.” And though her life is quieter, her work has become louder. “Before, I thought I ran on a chaos engine, but the more peaceful I am, the more I can give to the work. I can address things I wasn’t capable of doing before.”Florence likes to trick herself. She does it with a blue pen, writing what she calls little “self dares of truth”, reassuring herself that she won’t show them to anyone. “Shh, it’s OK, it’s just us…” And it was as one of these that Hunger, the first single from her new album, High As Hope, began. The first line is: ‘At 17, I started to starve myself.’ “It’s the first time I’ve been able to put it on paper,” she whispers. ‘I thought that love was in the drugs,’ the song continues, ‘but the more I took, the more it took away. And I could never get enough. I thought that love was on the stage. You give yourself to strangers, you don’t have to be afraid.’ “But now I’ve realised that that nugget of insecurity and loneliness is a human experience. The big issues are there however you address them.” She giggles suddenly. “The weirdest thing is, that as personal as it feels, as soon as you say it, other people say: ‘I feel like that, too.’”She was terrified, talking about her eating disorder for the first time. Not just talking – singing. Her sister was baffled. “Like, ‘You couldn’t admit this for years, and now you put it in a pop song?’” But the terror meant, Florence says, that she needed to do it.Terror drives her, or pushes her forward, a sharp pitchfork in her back. She was an imaginative child, but imaginative in a way that sounds oppressive, confusing – she believed that ghosts and werewolves were real. Still wonders. “I learned ways to manage that terror – drink, drugs, controlling food. It was like a renaissance of childhood, a toddler’s self-destruction let loose in a person with grown-up impulses.”Recently, she was staying at the Chateau Marmont in LA, and woke with a start to find a white dress hanging above her head. “Then suddenly I was in the bathroom, screaming. Was it sleep paralysis? I don’t know how I got to the bathroom.” It’s only recently she overcame her fear of the dark, but she says this with no embarrassment. In the lead-up to the release of Hunger, in May, she says: “I was a nightmare – I cried all the way through Avengers: Infinity War.”Did something happen when she was 17, to trigger that descent? She pauses for a very long time. Her coffee goes cold. Outside, seasons change. Apologetically, she looks away. “I know how to deal with it in a song, but a lot of stuff I’m… still figuring out? I can say things in a song I don’t understand yet, like: ‘I thought love was a kind of emptiness’ – that feels important. You think love is unreachable, empty, hungry, then there’s a kind of sadness when something more stable comes towards you. You don’t recognise it as love because it’s not desperate enough. And I’ve never tied the two together until now.”Is she through that now? Is she eating? She takes a deep breath. “I’m further away from it than I ever have been. It was something I experienced and I’m 31 now and at a time where I can perhaps… see what I was looking for?” Her speech is lilting, soft south London, and punctuated liberally with ellipses.On Florence’s 30th birthday her sister had a baby, and the benefit of her new quiet life is that she’s been able to be there for her niece’s first year. “We help each other through. I’ve done career, she’s done family, and we’ve both seen behind the perfection. I’d love to be married, but I can see the good and bad in each life. I’ve wondered sometimes: ‘Did I dream too big, do I have to let it go?’” Going on tour, she’s realised, she goes into a state of stasis, popping out years later to find that not only have all her friends had kids and got married, but grown up in even grander, less definable ways, learning things like how to break up well – something she is yet to master – and how to feel “deserving of love”.Though her father, Nick, an ex-ad executive, left London to open campsites, she lives close to both her sister and her mother, Evelyn, a professor of renaissance studies when Florence talks about her, she nods slowly as if contemplating a difficult Sudoku.“My mum was so worried about me doing music – she thought it was dangerous, could hurt me, could be fleeting. She’s accepted it’s not a phase now. But she’s been through a lot, so always prepares for the worst.” Her mother mourns the fact Florence didn’t go to university. Once, she told her she could remember every outfit she’d ever worn, and her mother said: “What a waste of a brain.”But, as Florence navigates this quiet life, their similarities are becoming more clear to her. Watching Evelyn lecture about a pair of renaissance gloves she saw, suddenly, where her performance gene came from. “And people tell me I disappear – that’s like her, too, and it can be isolating in a relationship, and maybe was isolating when we were kids. Like me, I think she has big feelings, but she’s put them somewhere else, away. I’m still figuring out what that well of longing in me is, and looking at the origins.” Then there is another pause, so deep you could swim in it. “My mother’s mother committed suicide. And the way she was loved by her mother has related to the way she loves us, which then is the way we love others. My grandmother fell, so sometimes I feel like we’re all still in this loop, falling with her. The trickle-down of tragedies.”It’s only recently that she started talking about this with her mother, and those dog days after she was 17, and the way her relationships have followed the patterns drawn in childhood when she was an “octopus of feelings”, always hungry for attention from unavailable people.Her first book of poetry, Useless Magic, an elegant collaged scrapbook, is dedicated to her parents. The first words, written in Biro, are: “I make songs to tie people to me.” It’s in the same pen that she writes daily “sermons”, as she calls them, and she uses them to acknowledge and find the humour in the strangeness of her pop star life. For instance, she wants a record of having been drunk in a corridor with Liza Minnelli, and a record too that she knew this should never be mistaken for a normal afternoon.These undrinking days she still enjoys parties, but uses them to dance rather than get high – if someone starts making small talk with her and there’s music playing she will literally spin away towards the speakers.After we meet, having had a conversation that veered from recurring dreams she had as a child to a new Tinder bio (“Deeply domestic but also high stress, with no middle ground – hugely exposed but deeply hermity. Too many candles burning in my house to be safe”) she emails over a selection of these daily sermons. They’re scrappy and funny, and one ends: “I would also like a thousand texts that say ‘I love you,’ my phone buzzing endlessly, until I am exhausted, and empty. Oh shit.”For somebody whose career balances on drama and the guttural expression of heartbreak, she seems remarkably peaceful, almost happy. But sometimes, while she is in her tour bus on the way home to London, the maggot of an idea will burrow into her mind and she will think: “Wouldn’t it be a relief to go partying now? What if… what if you just fucked it all up? What if you drove all this into the ground?” She shakes her head suddenly like there’s water in her ear. “It’s still there. This, ‘What if I could take a day off, a break from this magical energy?’ But,” she grins, “it passes.”High As Hope is out now. Useless Magic is out on 5 July, £20, Penguin Books.

It isn’t the process of getting pregnant, with its cycles of raised and dashed hopes, or the term “sperm donor”, with its unsettling connotations. It’s not even the queasy feeling that what you are doing sets you apart from other people and that the reason you are doing it is not that you are a powerful, rational, resourceful woman, but, as a friend of mine put it after considering and rejecting the idea of having a baby alone, that “I couldn’t get anyone to shag me”.No. The hardest thing about having a baby alone is making the decision to do it.“So are you going to do it then?” says Rosemary. It is late summer 2013 and we are drinking whisky in a hotel bar in Edinburgh. “Yeah, probably,” I say. “I mean, I might. Are you?”I haven’t seen Rosemary for months and it is only after a lot of whisky, and with a casualness that belies the cold terror underneath, that we reach the main order of business: our ongoing discussion, part lament, part spur to action, over what to do about having children. That is: if, when, how and with whom, or, since we are both, for the purposes of this conversation, single, “with” “whom”.I have always known I wanted children. From the time I was old enough to conceptualise my future, motherhood made sense to me. It was always one child in my imaginings and never part of a fantasy about marriage, and while everything else in my life changed over the years – the country I lived in, the kind of work I did, the gender of the people I dated – the distant outline of a child remained steadfast. On the rare occasions I allowed myself to inspect it directly, the idea that it might never happen made me feel giddy with loss.I met L two years after moving to New York. On the surface of things, we looked very different – me, English, lefty, fundamentally unkempt she, New Yorker, centre-right, well put together. On any given day we could disagree about everything – fact or fiction, subway or car, Republican or Democrat – so that, in the months after we met, it felt like being on safari in each other’s alien worlds. If falling in love is, partly, a question of finding a docking station for one’s neuroses, I knew I was home when L told me that, after her building was evacuated during 911, she went straight to an off-licence and bought hundreds of dollars’ worth of booze in case civilisation collapsed and the world reverted to a barter economy. Come the zombie apocalypse, this is a woman you want on your side. But there was this, too: the house she grew up in would one day have to be sold, she said, and what she would miss most were the things you can’t take with you, like the sound the stairs made when they expanded at night. Somewhere in my system, a pilot light flared.She was three years older than me and told me from the outset that, in the near future, she was planning on trying to get pregnant. Logistically, this made sense it would be madness to forestall while we flapped about for another two years trying to decide what we were doing. Emotionally, however, it stumped me. According to every relationship model I knew, you could either be with someone who’d had kids before you met, have kids together and separate down the line, or split up and have a baby alone. There was no such thing as being with someone who had a baby on her own. It sounded like a terrible deal: all the stress and anxiety without the substance of motherhood.At that stage, the strongest terms in which I could have put my own long-held but dormant desire for a baby were that I didn’t want not to have one. If there was, behind this impulse, a larger, less tangible longing, I didn’t want to look into it too deeply lest it unleash a full-blown baby hunger I couldn’t get back in the box. But I started to notice small, unsettling changes in myself. When somebody asked me, “Do you have children?” – a question that, until recently, I had responded to in my head with versions of, “Are you mental? I’m about 11” – it started to sound less neutral, more unfriendly. I had always believed that, medical issues aside, most women without children had acted through choice, but my faith in this weakened. I watched as a number of friends missed out on having children because their boyfriends broke up with them when they were in the vicinity of 40, before having children with younger women. I watched as women six, seven years my senior finally met someone new and went through round after punishing round of IVF. I didn’t want to be alone at 45, or 50, and on Tinder, dating people with children when I had none of my own. I didn’t want to be 70, the age my mother was when she died, lying on my deathbed without the image of my child’s face in my head. Above all, I didn’t want to look back on this period and wish I’d had the courage to act.I also didn’t want to “help” another woman raise her baby. Unless I was Mother Teresa (I’m not), the only way it would make sense for me to stick around in the event of L having a child was if our relationship became a more conventional union, or if I had my own baby independently, too.It’s not that L’s pregnancy made me more broody (I defy any woman to see another woman’s early pregnancy up close and think, “Hey, that looks fun!”) and I wasn’t bound by her decisions. We didn’t live together. In fact, an infantile strand of my personality deliberately wanted to make different decisions. If we were going to suffer the deprivations of single parenthood, we might as well realise all the advantages, too – in my case, starting from scratch and doing precisely what suited me and my notional baby.All I had to do was figure out what that was. Would I use a friend as a sperm donor, or a stranger? If the former, who? If the latter, how would I make that choice? Would I move back to London for free treatment on the NHS (which, to the horror of the rightwing press, now offers fertility services to single women and lesbians) or stay in America and spend thousands on something that might not even work? In the event, I choose the path of least resistance: America will never really feel like home, but it is where I live, where L has her baby and where, eight months later, I am sufficiently panicked to finally get moving with my own.One of the things you have to get used to when you are a British person embarking on fertility treatment in the US is the pace. In Britain, the law of supply and demand is such that there are more women wanting sperm than there are donors, so even private clinics have waiting lists. In America, where no one with adequate resources waits for anything, you have a chat with your doctor, schedule a date, call the donor bank, which bikes the sperm round to the clinic, and off you go. You might have spent six months or six years deciding to do this but you could, potentially, be pregnant within a month of first seeing your doctor.That is, if you have made what feels at the time like the hardest decision: how to pick a donor. This question probably cost me six months of concentrated flapping, during which time I asked a male friend if he’d do it, because it seemed more “normal” than the alternatives, and was achingly relieved when he said no, before eventually deciding to find an anonymous donor.This is a tricky part of the story for me. There may come a day when it is as regular as milk to share details of one’s sperm donor – when there is a language less alienating to describe it than this, and that feels less compromising of one’s child’s privacy. But we are not there yet, and I’ve no idea how to calibrate this choice. Is it the biggest of my life, or essentially meaningless? Underplay the donor and you risk turning the guy into the elephant in the room go on about him too much and you risk pathologising your child’s background. Scrolling through profiles, I look for characteristics that align with my own. I want someone clever, which here means educated. I want someone with dark hair. I want someone whose favourite film isn’t Once Upon A Time In America or Titanic. In the absence of a metric for gauging a man’s humour or internal beauty or moral worth, I want someone tall and basically symmetrical. A choice is superficial only if it is made at the expense of deeper considerations and so, although I reject sperm donors on criteria that would outrage me if applied in real life by men to women, I tell myself I’m not doing anything wrong.Everything is extra: $35 for the guy’s baby photos $50 for an audio file. Guidelines vary, but in New York you can see photos of him only as a child. Some donor banks offer a “silhouette” of him as an adult, which would be hilarious if it weren’t so creepy. What next – his breath in a jar to rule out halitosis? I don’t listen to the audio files. I don’t try to find the guy, even though there is so much information, it would probably take me less than a day. This is not gene selection it is the selection of the story of how my child came to be, and, through a combination of vital statistics, familiarity of background, a subtle implication that he is a Democrat and his use of the word “tremendous”, which signals to me a certain wryness and enthusiasm, I make my choice. In other words, on nothing substantive. What matters is it’s my choice and I make it.I pay extra for ID disclosure, enabling any child to trace the donor when they turn 18. I decide how much to buy – enough for three cycles – then fill in a form and return it, along with payment for almost $2,000. When I call to confirm my request, I half expect the receptionist to laugh and ask what on earth am I doing, trying to buy genetic material over the phone as if it were lunch? Instead, after I mumble, “Need to order some sperm”, she puts me through to the lab, where a technician will check to see if what I want is available.I give him the donor number. There is a clacking of keys, followed by a short pause. Then, with the smoothness of a sommelier fielding a wine order at dinner, he says, “An excellent choice.”After weeks of monitoring, at the end of 2013, my eggs are ready. This is it, says Dr B. I can come in tomorrow and, after waiting an hour for the sperm to defrost, finally get this show on the road. He asks if I’d like L to be present when the insemination takes place. “Some people find it nice to involve their partners.”Fertility treatment can be hard and excluding, he says, and involving the patient’s partner, even to the extent of inviting him or her to operate the syringe full of sperm, can give them a feeling of inclusion. I blush. Clearly he’s in favour of L being present, either because it gives him a warm feeling or to neutralise some latent ambivalence he has about helping to create single mothers.I try to imagine the scene: me, stressed out and half-naked on a gurney L, holding the catheter and rolling her eyes the medical staff, trying not to intrude on our beautiful moment. I don’t think I want L there – I don’t want anyone there, it’s embarrassing – and when I imagine asking her, I realise I don’t want to give her an opportunity to say no, either.There is a cold, mean streak in me that makes me think trying to involve the partner is ludicrous under any circumstances. Surely there’s a dignity in allowing things to be what they are? This is a medical procedure pretending otherwise risks making the treatment seem sadder, just as choosing a sperm donor will continue to feel sad, or bad, or weird, as long as it’s tied to conventions associated with choosing a spouse.The next day, a week before Christmas, Dr B breezes in full of good cheer. We chit-chat as he loads the syringe with a substance that is, gram for gram, more expensive than the world’s finest heroin (though less expensive than marrying someone you’re not into in order to have a baby).The cycle fails, as do the subsequent three cycles, one of which results in a short-lived pregnancy and all of which mean that, by the spring of 2014, I am taking, for the second month in a row and despite producing too many eggs the first time, large amounts of fertility hormones.It is different this time.“How do you feel?” says Dr B.For five days I have been injecting myself with a preloaded pen, which has bruised me terribly. The skin of my abdomen looks like 1970s wallpaper, all bright purple flowers with a greeny blue border. I feel altered, hideously bad-tempered. I tell myself it’s chemical and will pass. But it doesn’t. A week after finishing the injections, Dr B looks at my charts and tells me to stop taking the drugs. Ten days later I go in for insemination number five.“Whoa,” says the nurse doing the ultrasound. “You’ve a lot going on in there.”I look at the screen: a lot of shapeless dark patches connected by strings.“They look like spider’s eggs,” I say, and shudder.I have, once again, overreacted to the hormones. But Dr B says not to worry: not all of them are mature. I could call off the cycle but I say, “Go ahead.” The sun comes out that weekend, and L and I take a walk with the baby in the buggy. I feel Zen in the face of all possible outcomes. On Monday night I go into my kitchen and crack an egg against the side of a pan for dinner. Two bright yellow yolks slide down. I have never seen such a thing before and stare down at the eggs, feeling bad for the hen. I am so surprised I say it out loud: “Twins.”It’s twins. Of course it is. How could it not be? I am a walking exemplar of the phrase, “Be careful what you wish for.” Over the next few weeks I wait for the idea of carrying twins to normalise, but it doesn’t. For minutes at a time I forget I’m pregnant, then I remember with the force of the original shock. I have lunch with an old friend I haven’t seen for a while. I know he’ll be shocked, too, and he is.“How’s that going to work?” he says.And there it is, the question we’ve been avoiding since L’s pregnancy. If I have these babies, what will the babies be to L and what will she be to them? The answer is only partly to be found in the relationship I have with her baby. There is no honorific to describe what I am to him and there is no word for what he is to me. He is at the centre of us, the miracle over whom we both marvel, but I have no moral, financial or legal responsibility for him. Neither do I perform many of the most basic parental duties. I have always known this lopsided arrangement would be tolerable only until I had a baby of my own. What I hadn’t anticipated is the ways in which its limitations would also prove to be strengths. In the year since his birth, my relationship with the baby has evolved to be oddly free-floating from that with L. He is my buddy, a child in whom I have no stake other than love. That it’s a love I’m not bound – by law or biology – to feel makes it all the more precious.On the other hand, what am I doing potentially bringing two further children into a situation it takes so long to explain? I can just about rationalise to myself why a woman without a child might want to maintain a degree of separation from a partner with a child, given the vast difference in lifestyle. But two women in separate households with babies of a similar age who hang out on evenings and weekends? If we’re not a blended family, then what on earth are we? Clearly, at this point, the proper course of action would be to either give up this nonsense of separate households and separate children, and move in together, or else call it a day. There is no middle way. Perhaps it is selfish. It’s selfish to carry on along parallel tracks, denying the children a second parent and creating two single-parent families. It’s selfish, practically, morally, financially and environmentally, to maintain our independence while being together, like driving two cars to a single destination. And while my relationship with L’s baby is full of joy, how can it survive once I have my own children and am unable to travel back and forth to see him?For the first time I seriously question why I want to do this alone. It isn’t just that L and I have conflicting ideas about parenting – very broadly, I am too mean in her eyes, and she isn’t mean enough in mine – it’s the historical weight each of us puts on those differences and our assumptions about where they might lead us. We both have a highly developed sense of self-preservation, which expresses itself in different ways, except, perhaps, in this one shared belief: that the way one protects children from harm is by controlling who has access to them. The only thing more frightening to me than not having a baby is having a baby in a hostile environment. One afternoon L sends me an email with a link to an apartment listing that is almost double the rent I pay in Brooklyn. The floor plan looks familiar, as does the view from the window. It’s in her building, the mirror image of her home, but one floor down.“?!” I reply.“But do we want to live that close to each other? Isn’t it weird?”I go to see it. The landlord is putting in new flooring and a new bathroom and most of the apartment is under polythene, but because it’s an exact copy of L’s, bar the fixtures and fittings, I don’t have much trouble imagining it. It occurs to me, as I walk around, that he may not even want to rent to a single woman expecting two babies. But in any case, it’s too expensive. Eeven if it’s the kind of building I need, with a mail room and an elevator and a maintenance team on site even if it would be amazing to have L upstairs when I bring the babies home even if the very fact that the listing came up in the first place, in a co-op that discourages rentals, is the kind of coincidence that feels like a gift from above – none of that matters, because I can’t afford it.It is, surely, nuts: to sort of live together but not. It feels like cheating, to have L’s support and proximity without the hard work of cohabitation. How would we explain it to the children? Or to ourselves? That we like each other sufficiently to be in daily contact, except on days when we don’t? What would the kids even be to each other? Cousins? Best friends? The victims of a half-arsed piece of emotional evasion, or beneficiaries of a radical new vision?In those first weeks after moving, we enter a honeymoon period in which the loveliness of living almost together is nothing to the luxury of living sort of apart. The act of leaving my flat and walking up one flight imbues daily visits with the tiny frisson of occasion. When one of us snaps, the other goes home without it being construed as a histrionic gesture. There’s no marriage or joint mortgage, but a commitment has been made. I have the long-overdue realisation that relationships rely on a balance between independence and the right level of curtailment of freedom to liberate one from the burden of choice.One evening, L sits on the sofa with her son, reading a book about different kinds of families. “‘Some people have two mommies,’” she reads, pointing to an illustration of two badgers wearing earrings with a baby badger in their midst. “‘Some people have two daddies. Some people have one mummy, hasome people have one daddy.’” Her baby, who isn’t a baby any more but a toddler and the most delightful child in the world, isn’t quite old enough to formulate questions and we are off the hook for a little while yet. L and I exchange glances. “Some people have a neighbour,” she says, sotto voce.My final ultrasound of the year falls just after Christmas. I am six weeks from the due date. The technician looks at the screen. He frowns, says something I don’t catch and leaves the room. Someone else comes in. Everyone gathers by the monitor while I look at the ceiling and try to figure out what to have for lunch. A fourth doctor comes in and tells me to get dressed and follow him. I feel a spike of alarm. In his office, my high-risk obstetrician, Dr Y, is waiting.“They have to come out,” Dr Y says.“Oh my God.”The placenta for the smallest baby is working only intermittently if it stops altogether, she’ll die.“This is not an emergency,” Dr Y says calmly, “but it is… fairly urgent.” He tells me he has time the following day, New Year’s Eve, or the day after that.“Let’s do it tomorrow,” I say, trembling.My dad is in London and offers to come straight to New York, but I don’t want him in the air while I’m having surgery I can’t add fear of his plane going down to everything else. At L’s that night, I tell her to ask her mother to come across town the following day to watch her son.“I’m so happy you’ll be there,” I say.“It’s only because everyone else is in England.”“No, it isn’t. I would want you to be there, whatever.”As I say this, I realise it’s true. Fear pushes me inward, joy pushes me out, and while I am as frightened of having these babies as of anything, it’s a different kind of fear: not a shrinking but an opening out. I have been so stringent in ensuring I can do this alone, perhaps the reward is that I don’t always have to.Right up until the last moment, a small part of me thinks, what if all this is a mistake? What if Dr Y turns to me and says there’s nothing in there – of course you’re not pregnant! Did you think that, by signing a few forms and handing over your credit card, you could dodge millennia of evolution, not to mention convention and common decency? Go home, buy yourself a cat and never speak of this again.But at 4.17 pm the next day, a tiny, fierce cry fills the room. Baby A is removed from the basement of my body. I burst into tears. L grips my hand. A moment later, Baby B comes out and L leaps from her seat in the direction of the babies while Dr Y, turning to his students, holds a quick pop quiz over my guts. Then the nurses bring over the babies.L gets all of this illegally on camera. It’s not footage I can watch too often. The babies, two flat-faced Glo Worms covered in gel, are blotchy and impossibly alive. I am insane on the gurney, grinning drunkenly at my two girls. Over and over I say it, in the manner of a woman shortly to be given more drugs: “Oh my God, I can’t believe they’re both blond.”• This is an edited extract from An Excellent Choice by Emma Brockes, published by Faber \u0026amp Faber at £16.99.

But millions of people don’t have bank accounts. Will they be cut out of this new economy?A strange thing happened to me recently. I was in a bar, but I couldn’t buy a beer. Or, to be exact, I refused to. I was in Öl at Hatch, a shipping container complex of food and drink purveyors on Oxford Road in Manchester, where the bar – to my surprise – was card-only. No cash. They had no way of taking my £10 note. It was stalemate. I had cards on me. But, in instinctive solidarity with the unbanked, those paid in cash or those who, like me (for years, a permanently skint freelancer), still budget in cash, I stood firm (and thirsty), irritated that any business would dictate how its customers pay.I sat down to eat a curry I had bought (with old-fashioned cash) from another Hatch unit. Then, an Öl barman brought over a conciliatory glass of beer, on the house. I told him the bar’s cash-free policy is elitist who wants to be forced to put a pint on a credit card? He talked about time saved and how not having cash on the premises was safer for the staff. We politely agreed to disagree.But where does this leave people without bank accounts (nearly 2 million people, according to the Financial Inclusion Commission), or those with poor credit histories who have to pay fees to use prepaid debit cards? Removing the cash option penalises them.“We’re aware of the community issues,” says McCall. He says that Takk gives free coffee to homeless people sleeping rough – those at the sharp edge of this cashless evolution. “But when we’re picked up on the fact we could be excluding people, we have to say that’s a story for banks and government. Scandinavia is largely cashless, and there businesses and governments are having that debate.”It is a debate that Britain may soon be having, too, as a wave of card-only food and drink venues hit UK high streets. With the exception of London’s bus network (cashless since 2014 south London’s trams follow suit in July), cash-free everyday businesses have previously been experimental one-offs. But now if you want a wrap at the Athenian in Bristol, a salad at the London chain Tossed or a coffee at Habitat cafe in Aberfeldy, Perthshire (after its local bank branch closed, Habitat’s owners were facing a 60-mile round trip to the bank) you will need to pay by card.Card-only bill settlement is faster for diners, makes it easier to split bills and is cost-effective (no safe, no bank charges, fewer accounting errors, no cashing-up). If Killer Tomato took cash, says Paice: “On a busy night, I might have two staff counting and reconciling the float with the receipts. I’d be paying senior staff to count coins.”What is clear, however, is that the new card-payment processors, such as SumUp and iZettle, make going cashless far more attractive. The established “merchant services” providers (which hire out card readers on long contracts and charge a variety of fees on different card transactions), are, says Paice, “complicated and deliberately opaque. It’s impossible to know what you’re going to be charged.”In contrast, the new players in the “fintech” sector levy a set percentage for each transaction. No contract. No expensive card readers. “iZettle has transformed payment-processing,” says McCall, who adds that it costs a tenth of his old provider’s service.The infrastructure is there for cashless, says Paice, as is the customer enthusiasm. Very occasionally, he has to turn someone away, but he adds: “In two years, I have had four angry customers – and I’m guessing the ones who get really angry are people operating in cash because they’re fiddling their taxes. They give me this phoney outrage about how I’m discriminating against the poor or old people. It’s cobblers. Flat-broke people are not eating in restaurants and everyone in London has a bank card: 12-year-olds, 90-year-olds. What they really mean is: ‘I don’t want to declare my income.’”“The haptic, physical sensation of handling and spending a £20 note makes you ‘feel it’. With cashless, that is lost somewhat,” says Jez Groom from Cowry Consulting, which researches “behavioural economics”. “The Apple Pay ding you get from your iPhone should be replaced with a vibration calibrated to the amount spent: light for under £10 heavy and consistent for £30.”For these reasons and more, David Fox, owner of the East Street and Tampopo restaurants in London and Manchester, has no intention of going cashless. But, given Britain’s direction of travel (“no institution is defending cash”), he can already see a future gap in the market for a restaurant aimed at people who crave the authenticity of notes and coins. “Like buying vinyl,” he asks, only half-joking, “will there be a generation who still enjoy the interaction of cash?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc60816820ef3fdf97b5680ef738f68788005097/0_154_3632_2179/master/3632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2169af9611cc1c354c8784d9f8e574f6","title":"how i learned to love the three generation holiday","story":"A week away with children and grandparents has all the ingredients for a nightmare. Here’s how to make it a triumph…“How was the trip to Center Parcs with three generations of your partner’s family?” friends are asking politely. And to them I reply: “I’m still processing.” Here is what I learned:The trick to spending time with children is to give up all pretence of adult life and descend willingly into a world where those over eight are simply used as security and for collecting snacks. And you must go willingly, you must make the choice, first to enter the compound, with its fattened ducks and eerie silence after 9pm, and then to submit fully to a week without saying no. There is a playground round every corner, there’s an entertainer at breakfast time – all meals come with crayons and some taste of them, too. In every restaurant there is a soft-play area, an idea that I urge all businesses to roll out, immediately – it means the children are not tied to their adults through the means of iPads and threats, instead popping over for their chips, then back again to their cousins to continue the construction of an elaborate structure made out of shoes. Which gives the grown-ups time to continue their new favourite game: “Here’s what I’m going to say in an email to the management about how to improve Center Parcs.” Who knew we were such geniuses of town planning and tourism? By the end of each day, we had designed our own far superior versions (my particular irritation was with the add-on prices for each activity, though we did enjoy holding a very large owl) and could rest in the knowledge that, like Westworld or Westfield, we could fix this heaven experiment over the course of an afternoon.There are a handful of places in the UK where I am acutely aware that I’m Jewish, and this is one of them. This despite a colleague, having asked which Parc we were going to, smiling knowingly: “Ah, of course, the one for the liberal metropolitan elite.” Although the first time I visited Center Parcs, with my family and grandma when I was 10, we were perhaps the first chalet to host a full seder night, today we wear it lightly, I think, our Ashkenazi heritage, the only signs being the quantity of food my mother-in-law brought to barbecue and our bafflement at the boating lake. And yet I walked through this English land of burnt skin and badminton with a certain unplaceable anxiety. Perhaps everybody feels different here, a little apart from all the other guests with their artful manipulation of inflatables. It wasn’t until we were driving out into Bedfordshire, the barrier closing behind us, that it occurred to me we could have left at any time.Walking through a high street that’s been plonked in an ancient forest makes you feel dirty, these proud old trees dwarfed by a bustling Café Rouge. The idea was that these parks would be “an effective way for city folk to experience the countryside”. But we experience it with such sad apology that it makes you consider, not the beauty and grandeur of nature, but our too-human impulse to knock it down.I was awed by the 3G (three-generation) holiday, by the complete selflessness of my father-in-law choosing to spend his 70th birthday not at, say, a small Michelin-starred restaurant somewhere near the river, or in a comfortable living room surrounded by his many friends and a number of smoked salmon canapés, but instead with his kids and his kids’ kids, and those kids’ mothers, wiping ice cream off white T-shirts with a slightly dampened napkin. He made sandcastles in blazing heat, he detoured on foot to a supermarket to buy plasters with cartoon characters on them, he brought his own Nespresso machine, just in case.You can call anything a swimming pool if you put water in it. I learned this fairly quickly, as soon as we entered the subtropical swimming paradise and jostled our way into the tepid bubbles. It is a disconcerting feeling when both air and water are the temperature of urine, especially when surrounded by young children. They quickly ide into the too-scared and the too-fearless, the latter leaping off plastic rocks and bombing down slides as if on a stag night, the former clinging to their mothers so hard they bruise their tattoos. Every half hour, a Tarzan call echoes through the dome, signalling the start of the wave machine, and everyone comes scuttering from their games to pile into the pool, where babies float with enthusiastic yet slightly detached expressions, like the Queen seeing cows. Standing in these waves feels like being on a plane going down, with all the screaming and spillage that entails. The subtropical swimming paradise has a Starbucks and its own weather system and a queue for the flumes, and it was while waiting for my family to navigate all this that I read a Mumsnet thread about someone’s Darling Husband returning home from the Longleat park a little bit miffed because he was sure she’d told him that “going to Center Parcs” was a euphemism for anal sex.Some people hung knicker-bunting outside the Conservative MP Christopher Chope’s office after he blocked the recent bill to ban ‘upskirting’. It was the perfect (and perfectly British) response, and should be taken on in the future for all shows of contemptuous protest.Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine’s podcast, Dear Joan and Jericha, makes me absolutely hoot. Their advice to listeners with sexual problems is unsurpassable, and I particularly enjoyed the sensitive discussion about how Joan plans to explode her mother."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bf17566be5bb32867061bc829c974525ca083f2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d70373e6f60eaf06775726d580409dcb","title":"i couldnt bring myself to read my parents love letters for years","story":"Before her mother died, she handed over a shopping bag of private and personal letters sent long ago between her and her father. But what would Sabine Durrant learn about the man who died shortly after she was born?My father died just after I was born and I knew very little about him until I was in my 30s. I was a journalist then, and I approached it like an investigation, writing a memoir about what I discovered – his unhappy childhood, his life as a pilot in the navy, and his disappearance one November night during practice manoeuvres off the Dorset coast. The memoir was published in a book and serialised in a newspaper. After it appeared, my mother talked to me about him not much but enough. She told me he had been a great love, and she told me in heart-rending detail about the night he didn’t come back. We both cried, which was good, because I had got used to thinking she had forgotten him. We had met for lunch, and when we had finished eating she rummaged in her shopper and brought out a plastic bundle, a small Ottakar’s bag containing a thick pile of letters. “You can read these,” she said. “If you like.”I took the letters home, and I was going to read them that night. In some ways, it felt like victory. The teenage me, the one who in secret trawled for evidence, who had raged against her silence – would have drunk them in. I liked to think I had bypassed her in my search, because I hadn’t wanted to upset her. She was long remarried, with a life of her own. But if I am honest it had also been a way of snatching my father from her, of having him to myself. And maybe their letters were too much of a rebuke of this, provided too concrete a proof that he had been a lover, a husband, hardly a father at all. Or perhaps their existence was just too personal – that squeamish resistance all children feel towards parental intimacy. I put the Ottakar’s bag on the table in the hall, and at one point it was moved on top of the piano, and then it graduated into a space on the bookshelves behind. I stopped thinking about it. The bag, with its green logo and arc of orange, wasn’t sealed, the top with the handles just folded over, but it gave the impression of being bound in Sellotape and masking tape, of being as impenetrable as a cage.Things have changed while the letters have sat there. I had two small children when my mother gave them to me, my third child is now 14. The Ottakar’s in Putney Exchange, where my mother bought her books, was taken over by Waterstone’s many years ago. And for the last 18 months my mother hasn’t shopped there anyway, because the summer before last she went to a wedding in Canada and when she came back she discovered she had cancer and two weeks later she died.I’d always thought of death as something unusual, out of the ordinary, exceptionally unfair. Having a dead dad had made me interesting at school. Now, with the full force of my own mortality, I realise how ordinary death is. There’s nothing interesting at my age about having a dead parent. Lots of my friends are orphans, too. And the pain of it is very different. I had grown used to thinking of my father’s death as a hole, but now I realise it was a rock, a solid object, something you could rub up against. It’s the death of someone you have known and argued with and been frustrated by and loved – that’s a hole, that’s a crevice you have to stop yourself from falling down.I used to collect objects that had belonged to my father – a paisley dressing gown, a hand-knitted jumper, a copy of Knots, Splices and Fancy Work, squirrel them away like talismans, proof he had existed. Faced with the onslaught of my mother’s effects, I could hardly bear to keep a thing. I wrestled her possessions into bags, manhandled them out of the house. Off you go. You’re not welcome here. I asked a friend to take away her little watch, get it out of my sight. But my friend cleaned it and wrapped it in tissue paper and brought it back pressing it in my hand she said she thought I might regret not keeping it. And I knew she was probably right, but the truth of that felt a long way off.Eighteen months have passed now and I am glad I have the watch. I wish I had more not the clothes, perhaps, but the emails that disappeared, in a glitch with my server, and which I decided not to try to retrieve. I long to hear her voice, to have a bit of her back just for a moment. And as a result those old love letters have taken on a different force. I began to think again about reading them, circling the idea, like prodding a bruise – aware this time that it was more about her than him. I wouldn’t be reading them to discover, but to recover – to rewind time, to hear my mother’s words. She had given them to me. She had meant me to read them. And it began to feel like neglect, that I had somehow let her down.Yesterday, I decided to pick them up at least, to feel the weight of them. But we had the decorators in last year and the bookshelf where I was expecting to find the solid package, between Jane Bown’s photographs and the RHS Book of Gardening, was just a neat row of hardback fiction. I went upstairs, to a room we call my study, where I would surely have put it for safe keeping. But it’s a bit of a mess at the moment, a teenage dumping ground, and I began hurling things out – clothes meant for Depop, and broken lamps – and with a growing sense of desperation, shouted: “Where’s the Ottakar’s bag?” And when my partner shouted back, “What Ottakar’s bag?” I felt an overwhelming sense of sickness and loss, remembering all the other precious things I had neglected – including my father’s old jumper and my mother’s emails – and when finally I did find it, carelessly thrown behind some photo albums, coated in builder’s dust, I was crying.I didn’t know when I started writing this whether I would actually read them. I thought I would that essay about my father was a way to control emotions that felt otherwise overwhelming. But there is the old resistance – a feeling that they are not mine to look at. The packet has been in front of me while I have been typing, heavier and more substantial than I remembered a proper clout. I have begun to sigh a lot, those heavy tussles with breath that are an attempt to keep anguish at bay. But I am getting closer. Between that sentence and this I opened the bag and saw how each identical pale blue envelope has been neatly dated in my mother’s hand, that they  two years, 1961 and 62, the time before they were married, before I was born. There are 71 letters, and they were sent to different addresses – Brussels, Queen’s Gate, Copse Hill – all in the same spikey writing.And it comes as a shock, this. I don’t know why I hadn’t realised it before, that they are not a correspondence. Her letters to him would have been received at base or at sea, on the move, read, perhaps kept for a bit, but ultimately discarded. These, cherished and dated and placed in this bag the morning she met me: they are all from him to her. Fifteen years ago it wouldn’t have mattered. But today there is an immediate ache of disappointment, that she isn’t to be found here after all.A couple were loose, out of sequence, and I cast my eye over them. My dearest Anne (9 Jan 61), To my darling, darling Anne (Sept 62). The first was sent from HMS Victorious and is full of boyish high spirits: “There is a gale blowing at present so flying has been rather tricky as the flight deck moves round rather a lot making landing very difficult.” The second, written at Hal Far, is full of longing. “I’m too miserable here without you to write very much.” It’s enough. The poignancy is too painful in view of what was to come.I slip the letters back into the bag and I lay it at my feet. I think about her taking the letters from wherever it was she kept them (not her desk) and the love in her decision to give them to me. Was it by her bed, that bookshop bag? Had she just bought herself a novel? I think about how much she liked Ottakar’s in Putney, the layout, and the nice Costa on the second floor, where she would order an Americano, and her tendency to chide the shop assistant, if I didn’t get there in time, for not prominently displaying my books.And I remember the expression on her face when she gave me the letters. She had a habit, my mother, of showing you her holiday photographs while holding them in such a firm grip you had to strain your neck to see – quite often I experienced entire cruises upside down. And that’s what I think of when I remember this handing over. She was still holding tightly to the bag, not really letting go, even when they were already in my hand.Take Me In, by Sabine Durrant, is published on 28 June by Mulholland, at £12.99.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8085faf324d481368a475817df9fda8c773ccaf/0_74_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca85a8c05dc86902ef588ae7a85a95ab","title":"facebook journalism publishers","story":"George Orwell wrote in his essay Politics and the English Language: “In our age there is no such thing as ‘keeping out of politics’. All issues are political issues.” When Facebook constructed a new archive of political advertising, had it thought a little more about this concept of what is “political”, it might have more accurately anticipated the subsequent Orwellian headache. As it is, journalists are finding their articles restricted from promotion because they are lumped in with campaigning materials from politicians, lobby groups and advocacy organisations.The new archive of ads with political content, which Facebook made public last month, has become the latest contested piece of territory between platforms and publishers. The complaint from publishers is that Facebook is categorising posts in which they are promoting their own journalism (paying money to target particular groups of the audience) as “political ads”. Publishers have reacted furiously to what they see as toxic taxonomy.Mark Thompson, the chief executive of the New York Times, has been the most vocal critic, describing Facebook’s practices as “a threat to democracy” and criticising the platform in a recent speech to the Open Markets Initiative in Washington DC. “When it comes to news, Facebook still doesn’t get it,” said Thompson. “In its effort to clear up one bad mess, it seems to be joining those who want to blur the line between reality-based journalism and propaganda.”At a separate event at Columbia University, Thompson and Facebook’s head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, fought openly about the initiative. Thompson showed examples of where New York Times articles, including recipes, had been wrongly flagged as political. Brown emphasised that the archive was being refined, but stood firm on the principle that promoted journalism ought to be flagged as “paid-for” political posts. “On this you are just wrong,” she told Thompson.Publishers took to social platforms to question the labelling and representation of their work. One of the most egregious examples came from investigative journalism organisation Reveal. Last week, at the height of the scandal around the separation of undocumented migrant families crossing the US border, it published an exclusive story involving the alleged drugging of children at a centre housing immigrant minors. It was flagged in the Facebook system as containing political content, and as Reveal had not registered its promotion of the story, the promoted posts were stifled. Facebook did not remove the article, but rather stopped its paid circulation. Given the importance of paid promotion, it is not surprising that publishers see this as amounting to the same thing.The furore and confusion over what had happened to the post demonstrated that publishers were themselves confused about the new system. It also demonstrated the way in which even a well-intentioned initiative to add more clarity to political advertising could in fact militate against the rapid spread of what many would consider important high-quality news.Many people who use Facebook remain unaware that what shows up in their news feed can get there two ways: it is targeted by an algorithm based on their behaviour, profile and preferences and often it is targeted at their demographic by paid promotion. It is routine for publishers to pay to boost pages of their own journalism in order for them to reach a wider audience. In fact for many publishers it is a prerequisite of being read, as Facebook does not recognise or seek to categorise good journalism or urgent news over any other material.It is precisely these mechanics which led in the 2016 US election cycle to the platform playing host to all types of propaganda and “fake news” often masquerading as legitimate journalism. The idea that Facebook should add transparency to what was being paid for as political advertising was almost universally welcomed as a “first step” to combating misinformation.The friction over its implementation highlights a key tension within Facebook and all tech companies when it comes to dealing with cultural concepts. Should companies just rely far more heavily on human judgment or should they leave it to algorithms?Robots, algorithms, computers and maths are amazingly potent in their capacity to sort unique objects: faces, places, images and text can be searched and identified quickly at great scale. But things which are not unique, or which carry with them inherent ambiguity – such as culture, politics, humanity even – are unsuited to evaluation by any kind of artificial intelligence application. Orwell was right, everything is political: holiday photos are political fashion, weddings, theatre and film, architecture, are all in one sense political. (Maybe it is only the cat picture which the whole of the internet can agree on as being apolitical.)In deciding that a New Yorker piece in praise of adultery is “political”, the Facebook advertising archive algorithm might be making a profound, almost philosophical, judgment about hetero-normative values, but more likely it is just incompetently sorting material it can’t recognise. These examples are good copy, but essentially teething problems that Facebook has the capacity to solve.However, there are profound issues about the nature and control of the public sphere. As the large platforms now effectively are the internet for many people, their governance structures are of key public interest. If categorisation as being “political” has consequences for how fact-based reporting is perceived both by the public and by the algorithm, this could be catastrophic. It could lead to local news or urgent political coverage being harder to find – or prioritised according only to the amount a publisher or advertiser spends.The second is that Facebook is to some extent on the right side of the argument when it comes to labelling content. But it is unfortunately ill-equipped to deal with the type and scale of the task it has created for itself. There is a looming civic crisis in the field of political communications. The provenance of material masquerading as news often deliberately obscures funding sources and influences comb the Facebook political advertising archive around any keyword and you will find a host of apparently neutral news media entities which are funded and controlled by hyper-partisan groups. And these groups can also pay to promote articles from other news organisations in pursuit of their own aims. The number of New York Times articles paid for by candidates boosting their own campaigns is just as large as the Times’s own promotional strategies.The unavoidable core of this issue is taking transparency into the realm of political judgment, and separating legitimate news sources from non-legitimate. Nobody, including Facebook, wishes this organisation to have such a level of control over the free press or even political campaigning. The answer to Facebook, as has often been said, cannot be more Facebook.News and journalism are now dependent on Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple and others for many aspects of their existence. What is clear is that these companies are not inherently suited to be custodians of our information ecosystem, and arguably never will be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27db7f418d376fe70538fbbf896c4eb89d093632/86_410_5057_3034/master/5057.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9b9168657c1f57baeb4d54c93eced27","title":"lewis hamilton wins french grand prix sebastian vettel","story":"• Mercedes driver wins in France to re-take Championship lead• Hamilton unhappy with title rival over Valtteri Bottas crashIn a title fight that increasingly looks as if it is going to the wire, performance under pressure at key moments is going to be vital. At the French Grand Prix Sebastian Vettel was once again found wanting and Lewis Hamilton, in the manner England had shown in Russia before the race, was able to step up and clinically take advantage with a dominant display. He took the win and the lead of the world championship once again. If he is to secure his fifth title this season, these are the moments that will make the difference.After a poor weekend at the last round in Canada, where he saw his 14-point lead in the championship turned into a one-point deficit, Hamilton had still warned that he expected Ferrari would falter at some point. He might not have been expecting it to happen so soon, however, and Vettel’s error means he again holds a 14-point lead over the German.There was a celebratory air at Circuit Paul Ricard as the race welcomed France back to the Formula One calendar after a 10-year hiatus and the grandstands were flooded with tricolours and the stirring sound of La Marseillaise. But for Vettel, any optimism would have turned to regret barely moments after the final bars of the mighty anthem had died away.Starting from third behind Valtteri Bottas he had been quick off the line on the faster ultrasoft tyres but was too hot into turn one, locked up and found himself with nowhere to go, clipping the rear of the Finn. Vettel had to pit for a new front wing and Bottas for a puncture. They emerged at the back of the field while Hamilton, clear of the carnage, took to the clean air and controlled the race from start to finish. He took the flag in front of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen.Vettel was given a five-second penalty for causing a collision but drove an impressive comeback, scything though the field to take fifth, as much as he might have expected. But Bottas could manage only seventh after taking damage to the floor of his car from the puncture.Hamilton was pleased with his performance but critical that Vettel had not received a harsher penalty. “It’s disappointing for the team,” he said. “We all go into turn one as hard as we could but when someone destroys your race through an error and it’s only a tap on the wrist and you are still able to come back and finish ahead of the person you took out, it doesn’t add up.”He was joined in the criticism by the Mercedes non-executive chairman, Niki Lauda. “Why Vettel gets only five seconds for this enormous mistake, I don’t understand,” said the driver who won here for Ferrari in 1975. “It is too little. Five seconds is nothing, he destroyed the whole race for himself and for Bottas.”Vettel considered the punishment appropriate but he was left to consider another moment that proved costly. Last season his barge on Hamilton in Baku was ill-judged and his poor decision at the start in Singapore was the beginning of the end of his title fight. He was too hot on the restart in Baku this season and he lost places. He has the charging instincts of a racer but in this fight with Hamilton he simply cannot afford repeatedly to drop points.The German admitted he had been at fault. “My start was too good and I ended up with nowhere to go,” he said. “It was my mistake, I tried to brake and get out of it but I couldn’t. I had nowhere to go, with little grip I unfortunately made contact with Valtteri.”Mercedes had fitted their new engine here and will be buoyed by the clear evidence that it has matched and potentially bettered the step forward that Ferrari made with their new unit, although Vettel remained optimistic his team could have equalled them. “I think we had good pace,” he said. “It is difficult to say if we could have challenged but I think we had the pace to at least go with Mercedes.”His error means waiting until Austria and Silverstone to find out but here Hamilton had climbed into the cockpit, heartened from England’s demolition of Panama, and proceeded to deliver his own masterclass in applying relentless pressure to an opponent under the cosh. Doubtless he hopes he can continue riding the same wave as Gareth Southgate’s men.“6-1, that’s a mighty score,” he said. “What a great result for England today, if they are playing like that they need to keep opening a can of whoop-ass on everyone. That could be awesome, I don’t know how England would take it if we did win the World Cup. It’s been such a long time.”Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo was in fourth, Kevin Magnussen in the Haas was sixth the Renaults of Carlos Sainz and Nico Hülkenberg in eighth and ninth and Sauber’s Charles Leclerc once again drove superbly to take 10th.

He deserved to win. It’s a tough loss but I have to see it from a positive side. I haven’t been in any finals for a year, so this felt great. It came at the right time ahead of Wimbledon, the most prestigious tournament in the world, and I’ve had the fortune to win it three times.”The winner’s upbeat demeanour seemed more convincing. “Novak had such a great week, and it’s really good to see him coming back so well, health‑wise, playing at the top level,” Cilic said.“Last year I had a match point and couldn’t convert it, this year it was Novak. I definitely am relieved. I’ve waited six years to win again.”That was by default in 2012, when David Nalbandian had a brain fade, accidentally injuring a line judge when he kicked the advertising box around his legs. There was no such angst here, but plenty of tension.There was a time when Djokovic would rip open his shirt, eyes blazing, and beat his chest as if he were about to explode. Then, as he sought peace of mind away from the court, his serving elbow began to ache to the point of distraction, he withdrew from the Tour in despair. At 31, he does not appear to have shaken off all the demons.Djokovic should not be discounted at Wimbledon, though, especially in light of Federer’s first defeat on grass in 21 matches at Halle on Sunday – missing out on his 99th career title by losing 7-6 (6), 3-6, 6-2 against Croatia’s Borna Coric in the Gerry Weber Open final – and the struggles of his long‑time peers Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka and, on grass at least, Rafael Nadal. But serving a double-fault at 4-3 in the tie-break seemed to take the wind out of him, when he once would have gritted his teeth and found a way to prevail.Cilic arrived here with a proud record on the Queen’s Club grass. This was his fourth final in 12 visits. As Nick Kyrgios said before losing against him in the semi-finals, Cilic will be among the favourites at Wimbledon. “If he serves well and he’s physically feeling good, for sure,” said the Australian, who could not cope with Cilic’s precision.Djokovic had his moments on Sunday, forcing Cilic through 10 minutes of angst at the start of the second set, but after an hour and a half Cilic was making him earn every point. He had to scramble to save match point at 4-5 and, from that point on, grew in self-belief.Cilic won six points in a row to force a third set. The fretfulness heightened, as Djokovic fought against fatigue and his opponent’s increasingly potent forehand. He needed an ace to save break point in the eighth game, could do little about the angled forehand around the net that gave Cilic another chance and then dumped a weary forehand.Cilic served for the title and Djokovic, when once he might have roared back, put up barely token resistance, his final forehand sailing harmlessly long.Petra Kvitova hit back from a set down to beat Magdalena Rybarikova and retain her Nature Valley Classic title in Birmingham.The double Wimbledon champion had reached the final without dropping a set but was made to work by the Slovakian, who won the Birmingham title in 2009. But after dropping a tight opening set, Kvitova turned on the style to record a 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory in just over two hours.Like the world No 8 Kvitova, Rybarikova has fine grass-court pedigree, having reached last year’s Wimbledon semi-finals, and it showed in the opener as she seized the advantage.Rybarikova twice broke the Kvitova serve in the opening set and looked a strong candidate to claim the fifth WTA tour title of her career.But Kvitova proved a different proposition for the remainder of the match, breaking twice in the second set while having to save only a single break point against her serve.And despite being broken in the decider, Kvitova responded by breaking Rybarikova three more times to wrap up what ultimately proved to be a convincing win.

Famously, Yashere had to quit Britain and its low glass ceiling for black comedians, to get a break. But this homecoming gig shows she has left in body only. She remains every inch the Londoner, and her set navigates the landscape of British race relations and Anglo-Nigerian manners as deftly as if she had never been away.And she does so while largely avoiding the stereotypes in which previous routines have traded. This new show Funkindemup finds Yashere on her finest form – prowling the stage, alpha female, effortlessly in charge, at last enjoying the professional status she always felt she had earned. After some ice-breaking gags about rap music, she starts with a section on Windrush, slavery, and the “subtle, side-eyed racism” of the Brits – who are much cleverer than the Americans, says Yashere, at covering their racist tracks.The content here recalls her Daily Show item on the coverage of Harry Windsor and Meghan Markle’s engagement, as one white person after another expresses innocent surprise that Yashere could possibly be paying a bill or travelling first class. Contrast that – as she then does – with how people look at her in east Asia, which may be racist, or may be confusion about whether she’s female or male. Now we’re in Asia – where Yashere regularly tours – there’s a characteristically pop-eyed routine about hole-in-the-ground toilets, culminating in the deathless punchline: “That’s why when Asians poo, it looks like the emoji …”If you’re feeling queasy about these ethnic generalisations – well, Yashere is on to you. “I can feel white anuses clenching up,” she beams, before commissioning an Anglo-Chinese man in the second row to play referee. If he laughs, then it’s all right, she tells us – which is, of course, a crude and coercive device (that’s part of the joke), and a lovely way to send up and de-fang any liberal anxiety in the room. Of which there is little, because Yashere is always more ridiculous than contentious, and more clown than social commentator.Later in the show, we’re treated to Yashere’s account of a dust-up she recently had outside a Washington DC nightclub, and insights into her life as a Brooklyn gentrifier seething at the Jamaican party animal next door. She tries to complain – but her body can’t help dancing. The final section of the show is the most personal, as Yashere discusses her relationship with her African roots, coming out, and her recent experience of introducing a white American girlfriend to her prim Nigerian mother.I call it personal, and so it is – but none of it feels intimate. Yashere doesn’t give any more of herself away than is required to be funny, and her comedy unfolds along familiar lines, as her mother refuses to hear about Gina’s homosexuality (“I’m walking away!”) and firmly disciplined African kids marvel to hear white friends address their parents by – horror of horrors! – their actual names. It’s the comedy of cultural difference, served up in the conventional way but with no little flair from a woman who has got her career where she wants it – and, on this showing, deservedly so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b12cc0192d393bb102059442a139afa09d9ddc9a/0_1283_8424_5054/master/8424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4da247fa1b4039f7df3f0d34ec15b844","title":"picture resort from sandy beaches to stunning art galleries in st ives","story":"The Tate St Ives extension gives art lovers a perfect excuse to revisit this beguiling townSt Ives is a British seaside resort like no other. It has sandy beaches, the paradisal kind Brits dream of all winter and habitually get on aeroplanes for. This old fishing town in western Cornwall has not one, but five of them, and on these pebble-free playgrounds you will find retro cafes and chi-chi, cocktail-shaking restaurants. It has utilitarian shops, too, selling buckets and spades and Tupperware, and fancy ones. You can buy jewellery and in one lifestyle boutique you can pick up anything from a nature book to a designer beanie.There is something for everyone on the food front, too. There are more than 110 places to eat in this far-flung spot. You’ve got seaside staples, including fish and chips, ice-cream, burgers and pasty outlets, some with a modern twist. Take the pasty, the miners’ lunchbox staple. The Cornish Bakery does a cosmopolitan Travelling Empanada and even a sweet potato and feta version. But thin-crust traditionalists can default to a cheese and onion from SH Ferell \u0026amp Son, the tiny family-run bakery on the corner of historic Fore Street.Ice-cream lovers can get a timeless 99 or organic clotted-cream concoctions from Moomaid of Zennor. Be warned, though. The seagulls are on to Moomaid. When I came out of the ice-cream shack with a double cone of Shipwreck (dulce de leche caramel and honeycomb, oh the bliss) one swooped down and had its beak in it before I could cry Daphne du Maurier. Kids, meanwhile, can go to a children’s theatre show, take a boat to see seals or a drop-in art workshop, or go on a ghost trail.Appealing, you might say, but no different to any other British seaside resort that combines nostalgia and stylish consumerism. I’m thinking of Rock, further east along the north Cornish coast, Southwold in Suffolk or Whitstable in Kent – just without the sandy beaches.But what no other seaside destination can match is the range of artistic and cultural offerings of St Ives, which is not a shrine to art but a dynamic, creative hub. We spotted real live artists drinking in the 16th-century Sloop Inn on the harbour after a hard day in the studio. Sand, surf and culture, that’s St Ives’s unique offering. Kids can get their bucket and spade fix and teenagers can sunbathe or surf.The curious or creative can throw a pot at the famous Leach Pottery or drop into a life-drawing class at the St Ives School of Painting. Or do what we did, and admire the work of St Ives artists, from Ben Nicholson to Naum Gabo and Patrick Heron their work is now on permanent display in the new Tate St Ives extension. Our trip was prompted by the Patrick Heron retrospective showing there. Heron is a sort of God in this westerly artists’ colony, and during our short visit my husband and I encountered him in all kinds of ways.Heron was all about intensity, sometimes joy and always colour. His paintings are an invitation to engage. “The picture is not the vehicle of meaning,” he once said, “the picture is the meaning.” Heron’s work is not hung chronologically in Tate St Ives, because, according to the curator Andrew Wilson, it was formally consistent. For the visitor, this is liberating: there is no pressure to be clever, or to spot the development of his artistic practice. Just enjoy the work, experience it, Wilson seems to be saying.There are many locals who seem touched by Heron’s zest for life. One of them, Tamsin Thompson, runs the SILCo Sea Rooms, an all-day tapas and cocktail and gastrobar that feels like a ship’s cabin. Sit up at the window seats overlooking the harbour, and you feel like you are on the prow of a ship. Thompson’s three sons are the local producers of the first-rate St Ives gin, served with a slice of grapefruit as a counterpoint to the sweet botanicals, including Bladderwrack, a local seaweed and a splendid word. Thompson is a contemporary of Heron’s daughters, who I met at the exhibition, and she used to play at Eagle’s Nest, Heron’s home for 40 years in the village of Zennor further along the West Penwith peninsula, as a child. He was always laughing, she tells me, and wore purple shirts.There was more colour in work by local artists hanging on the walls at Pedn Olva hotel, a retro gem with modern flourishes that presides from a granite rockface over St Ives Bay. It’s the place to go for a fresh lobster and prawn roll, or a sundowner in either the rooftop bar or the terrace bar. The views have fused into a single memory of diffused light and strips of sea-sky-sand. The views got me in a pickle. Our shower had a big window, also overlooking the Celtic sea which, each afternoon, was choppy. In the morning, it was crashing against the rocks. I spent a long time staring out of that window, which I could have spent eating more scones and Cornish clotted cream. It’s true what they say about the light here: it is soft, and mesmerising. It makes you yearn for something, and made me wish I could paint.But then we went to Barbara Hepworth’s studio, and I wished I could sculpt. There is a permanent installation of her monumental sculptures in the subtropical garden. One of the Heron daughters told me there is a new head gardener there, and that he has revived Hepworth’s original planting plans. The space is meditative and energising.It is impossible to get your fill of light and sky and sea in St Ives. The trick is to find different ways to experience it. One way is to ride the St Ives Bay Line that hugs the craggy coast. We took the broad gauge train for all of three-minutes from St Ives up the track to Carbis Bay, where we disembarked for the airy and stylish Boskerris Hotel. We toasted more light and sky and sea with a glass of wine on the luxe deck overlooking the Bay. Fortified, we walked back across the beach and down a winding, shaded path that hugged the coast to take those scones and clotted cream in the café overlooking Porthmeor beach. Surfers love it here. Sand-averse sybarites can repair to the buzzing Porthmeor beach café, which does interesting tapas and seafood and – a glam touch this – boasts heated eating pods complete with blanket for chilly knees.Walk on this beach, and you’ll want to keep walking, as we did, setting off on the South West Coast Path. It was a five-mile, reputedly demanding, walk to Zennor, where Heron lived until his death in 1999. I’d heard the name Zennor so many times by now, it had cast a sort of spell. There is a pub there, the Tinners Arms, recommended by an artist we met in Helston, a rather more self-effacing artists’ hub 30 miles inland, which is home to studios and a world-class initiative called CAST (Cornubian Arts and Science Trust) featuring international artists whose work is currently on show in erse and wonderful locations throughout Cornwall.We didn’t get to Zennor, because we had a talk to get to about Patrick Heron in Mousehole, a painting-perfect harbour town that is home to the Newlyn Art School. You can do art courses here, should you fancy it. There’s a pub called the Ship Inn, where, from the deck of the garden, you can admire the light, again. Then go back to St Ives and have a look at Heron’s “Mousehole, 1946”. His daughters told me that he only went to Mousehole once, and the fishing village didn’t have happy memories for him. But it made an impression, for personal reasons, as St Ives, and Heron, will on you. Accommodation provided by Pedn Olva (doubles from £215 per night) and at the Boskerris hotel (doubles from £160 per night). Patrick Heron is showing at Tate St Ives until 30 September. For art classes, see St Ives School of Painting and Newlyn School of Art. Groundwork, a series of exhibitions and events featuring international artists, takes places across Cornwall until September 2018 as part of CAST. See c-a-s-t.org.uk for venues.

So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63959638d7570be331e3f50df44a6b1209d7f6dc/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8a7559fe4e6376683e7f3741a48b488","title":"erdogan claims victory in turkish presidential election","story":"“Our people have given us the job of carrying out the presidential and executive posts,” Erdoğan said on Sunday night, even while ballots were still being tallied. “I hope nobody will damage democracy by casting a shadow on this election and its results to hide their failure.”The main opposition party did not immediately concede defeat, but after initially saying Erdoğan would fall well short of a first-round victory, it later said it would continue its democratic struggle “whatever the result”.“This sets the stage for speeding up reforms,” the Turkish deputy prime minister, Mehmet Şimşek, tweeted of the results.The winner of the presidential race is set to assume extraordinary new powers narrowly approved in a referendum last year that was marred by allegations of fraud. These include complete control of the cabinet and the power to appoint senior judges and officials, including unelected vice-presidents. The president will also have the power to issue decrees with the force of law.Those powers will allow the victor to transform Turkey’s political scene for years and possibly decades to come, governing until 2028 if he wins re-election. Opposition candidates had pledged to overturn the presidential system if they had won.The results, if they stand, will be a disappointment to the opposition, which had hoped to push Erdoğan into a second-round runoff against İnce, and to wrest control of the legislature from the AKP. Erdoğan and his party have governed unopposed for 16 years.Erdoğan called early snap elections in April hoping to preempt worsening economic trends and to catch the opposition by surprise. He looked set to win easily in a presidential race and in parliament in alliance with the nationalists, projecting an image of a commander-in-chief fighting external enemies inside Turkey and across the border in Syria, and triumphant against terror groups. But the opposition mounted a dynamic election campaign, with its presidential candidate İnce drawing crowds in the hundreds of thousands in rallies in the country’s largest cities of Istanbul, İzmir and Ankara, and criss-crossing the country on dozens of rallies.Opposition officials cried foul as soon as results began coming in, with the state-run Anadolu Agency announcing preliminary results more than two hours earlier than expected and opening with a massive lead for Erdoğan and his party’s alliance in parliament.That lead closed over time, but it prompted accusations by the opposition that the state news agency was launching a manipulation operation to influence election monitors into leaving ballot counting stations early.The first result would lead to a second-round contest on 8 July, a possibility that would represent a major psychological blow for Erdoğan, even if he was tipped to win that contest as well.İnce urged ballot count monitors to remain at their stations until the counts had been completed to protect against election fraud.Nevertheless, Erdoğan appeared to be preparing for a “balcony” victory speech, and had already been congratulated on a win in the race by Hungary’s strongman leader, Viktor Orbán.The election took place on an uneven playing field, against a backdrop of human rights abuses that Amnesty International described as a “climate of fear”.One of the presidential candidates, Selahattin Demirtaş, ran his presidential campaign from a prison cell in Edirne where he is on trial on terrorism charges. The government has either shuttered, bought or taken over newspapers and TV stations, transforming the vast majority of the nation’s media into a loyalist press.Thousands of people have been detained or dismissed since a coup attempt in 2016, a crackdown that has gone beyond the followers of Fethullah Gülen, the man accused of masterminding the coup from his exile in Pennsylvania, to dissidents of all stripes including academics, students who opposed military incursions into Syria, judges, bureaucrats and police and military officers.Nevertheless, there were few incidents of apparent electoral fraud, with the exception of the province of Urfa, where some apparent attempts to rig the vote were uncovered during the course of the day. Poll stations opened at 8am and closed at 5pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd3db335e3e0dc1845074e76dfb6aa5a01920cb7/909_199_3482_2090/master/3482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b40323085ff41174351c6eda3f5974a","title":"saudi arabia women celebrate as driving ban lifted","story":"Celebrations in major cities as clock passes midnight in carefully stage-managed eventPolice officers gave them flowers, fathers gave their blessing and locals marked the moment with humour as Saudi women took to the streets in their cars after the ban on driving was lifted.As the clock ticked past midnight on Saturday, a group of women who had been granted licences started their engines, some with fathers or brothers alongside, and others in new cars bought for the occasion. Several women shouted with delight. Others cried, and many more took videos of their first forays at the wheel.The celebratory mood was mostly confined to pockets of Riyadh and Saudi Arabia’s second city, Jeddah, where the few women who have so far been granted licences were being feted as celebrities. Among them was Fadya Basma, a driver for a ride-sharing company, who is one of the first in Saudi Arabia to legally shepherd men around. “It’s a wonderful day,” she said. “And it will change things. Saudi will never be the same again.”Samar Almogren, a talkshow host and writer, said: “I always knew this day would come. But it came fast. Sudden. I feel free like a bird.”Saudi luminaries were quick to herald the moment. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the kingdom’s wealthiest men, posted a video at 12.01am local time (10.01pm BST) of himself with his daughter Rim at the wheel. “Mummy is not driving a buggy, but a real car,” he said. “Saudi Arabia has finally entered the 21st century.”Slogans and messages of support were shared on social media. “Today, you take on the streets, tomorrow, Mars,” said one. “This day will be marked in history,” said another. “Drive – we are with you.”Aware of the potential for the lifting of the ban to shift views about the rigidly conservative state, much of the lead-up has been heavily stage-managed, with lucrative consultancies offered to craft a message of a grateful people offering thanks to Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Aseel al-Hamad, a Saudi racing driver, has never driven on a track inb her home country, despite being a board member of the country’s motoring foundation. Her debut at the French Grand Prix, where she drove a Formula One car in a parade lap, was promoted by a public relations company, which released a statement in her name.“I’ve always loved car toys,” it said. “I had the privilege of driving race cars all over the world, but today will be the first in my beloved country. It’s a very special moment.”Photographs of police officers handing out flowers to female drivers were also carefully choreographed, but across the country, finding a woman behind the wheel during daylight hours was a difficult task. So far, the number of licences handed out has not been publicised. In Jeddah, about 30 women can legally drive. Many thousands more have applied.Nevertheless, support for the move and a belief that the small advance guard of drivers would soon lead to an influx appeared to be widespread and spontaneous. Ahd Niazy, a writer, said: “This means the world to me, and to the country. This generation changes things.”Women with international driving licences are thought to be given priority in being approved to drive, along with those deemed not to be involved in activism or seen as unlikely to pose a political risk.Nour, 24, speaking from a coffee shop in Jeddah’s corniche, said: “All I want to do is take to the roads. As soon as I can, I will. This is a great achievement for all women and it is definitely the key to bigger changes.”Saudi drivers from ride-sharing companies such as Uber seemed to be less convinced. “I don’t support women driving because I believe they are not the best drivers,” said one. Asked whether his three sisters would soon follow their compatriots’ lead, he said: “I’m not going to allow them and they did not even ask. They have a driver who can take care of everything.”Any resistance to the move in Saudi Arabia’s deeply conservative society is difficult to gauge. A crackdown on dissent over recent months has left many reluctant to express opinions, especially if they are at odds with official views. Fatima, speaking at a mall in Jeddah, said: “This is not the time to be defying anyone. What I think is not important.”State media was effusively supportive, with government-run titles lauding newfound independence and potential household savings delivered by reducing a demand for foreign drivers.Al-Mowaten, a news website, said: “Women being allowed to drive is a necessity more than a luxury. Women will rely on themselves when facing emergencies and difficult circumstances in which they will need to drive and act quickly, especially if a husband or other family member is suddenly stricken with an illness.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f923dc40231d46a308e07aef93c4b7d25cee35b9/0_0_6612_3967/master/6612.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=901e8e18e1c6d96c749e645689519e26","title":"birmingham and hyndburn ranked as uk areas with worst food hygiene","story":"Analysis by Which? also shows standards enforcement regime is under strain Birmingham city council and Hyndburn borough council have been ranked as the worst areas in the UK for poor standards of hygiene in their cafes and restaurants, for the second year running, a new analysis has revealed. Consumer group Which? said the enforcement regime was buckling under “huge strain”, with under-resourced local authorities struggling to cope with soaring complaints from the public – about dirty conditions and food poisoning, for example – and facing an increase in their workload because of Brexit. Using official data collected by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), Which? analysed and ranked 390 local authorities across the UK. The benchmarks it used were the percentage of food businesses deemed to be at “high and medium risk” that were compliant with food hygiene standards the percentage of premises opened but not visited or rated for risk and interventions needed that had actually been carried out.“When it comes to food, British consumers expect the very best standards for themselves and their families” said Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at Which?“But our enforcement regime is under huge strain, just as Brexit threatens to add to the responsibilities of struggling local authorities.“Effective food enforcement must be a government priority, including robust checks on imports as well as cooperation with the EU and other countries on food risks.”The Birmingham city council said it inspected the second highest number of premises and closed more than any other English local authority.Mark Croxford, the head of environmental health, said: “The quality of food businesses in Birmingham is not a measure or reflection of the council’s performance. I am surprised and disappointed to see Which? have made the same mistake as they have done in previous years, in failing to engage with local authorities to produce a meaningful report.”Responsibility for enforcing food safety falls to environmental health teams within local authorities, overseen by the FSA and Food Standards Scotland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1344a4518379ff4fc2c9624d864720cd89f18d72/0_0_5993_4016/master/5993.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fe365cd6eab1e86921ea2b7374f8b000 1320w","title":"zsa zsa english bulldog wins worlds ugliest dog competition in pictures","story":"English Bulldog wins competition in Petaluma, near San Francisco, California.

Bloomberg is currently reporting that Halk TV, a Turkish nationwide TV channel, have spoken to the opposition CHP’s candidate Muharrem İnce via WhatsApp. According to the network Ince has said that it was not a fair race, but he acknowledges that Erdoğan has won the election.A reminder that we are still awaiting official results, and the opposition CHP party has not conceded defeat:Ince – who in the past has won elections on a recount – has yet to comment:Here is Agence-France Presse’s first take on Erdoğan’s victory declaration:Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Sunday declared victory in a tightly-contested presidential election, extending his 15-year grip on power in the face of a revitalised opposition.Turkish voters had for the first time cast ballots for both president and parliament in the snap polls, with Erdoğan looking for a first round knockout and an overall majority for his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).The stakes in this election are particularly high as the new president is the first to enjoy enhanced powers under a new constitution agreed in an April 2017 referendum strongly backed by Erdoğan.“The unofficial results of the elections have become clear. According to these... I have been entrusted by the nation with the task and duties of the presidency,” Erdogan said at his Istanbul residence.He added that the alliance led by the AKP had won the majority in parliament.The figures could yet change as final ballot boxes are opened. But celebrations were already beginning outside Erdogan’s residence in Istanbul and AKP headquarters in Ankara, with crowds of flag-waving supporters, AFP correspondents said.Kareem Shaheen has this update:He praises electoral commissions and election observers, and mentions “brotherly” countries that have congratulated Turkey on the vote.A confident sounding Erdoğan listed a series of grand projects that Turkey will continue with under the new presidential system, and to continue pursuing an independent path for Turkey.He pledged to continue the fight, and was greeted with a round of applause, apparently by the assembled media attending the presser.Still, this is much more subdued than the victory balcony speech he was expected to give.Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has claimed victory in his country’s presidential election.“The Turkish public has mandated me as president according to unofficial results,” Erdoğan said. “I hope nobody will damage democracy by casting a shadow on this election and its results to hide their failure.”Senior CHP MPs insisted at a press conference just before Erdoğan’s statement that not all ballots have yet been counted and when they had been, a second round run-off would follow next month. We are no closer to a confirmed result. The opposition CHP party insists Erdoğan has not won outright and will have to go to a run-off the president’s supporters are already celebrating his win. This form the BBC’s Seref Isler:CHP MPs just held a press conference in which they challenged the election results, saying they would continue working through the night to monitor the counting of the votes. With millions of votes to be counted, I can hear AKP voters celebrating and honking cars in the streets anyway. It’s going to be a long night.This from Bloomberg’s Turkey bureau chief:Leading CHP MPs have said there is a big difference between the number of ballot boxes that have been opened, and the number of votes counted and actually entered into the electoral board’s computer system."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach says UK prime minister must resolve difficulties in her governmentChurch of Ireland dean accuses conferenceof \u0026lsquotactical use of homophobic rallying calls\u0026rsquoGroup says State resources could be used better helping drug-users and tackling serious drug crimeTickets for Knock and papal Mass in Phoenix Park available free from Monday morningGathering at Dublin Castle celebrates 25th anniversary of decriminalisationMan in his 50s dies in D\u0026uacuten Laoghaire while French national drowns in KillybegsDry weather and high temperatures to last until weekendGarda\u0026iacute not treating blaze in Enfield on Sunday as suspiciousDUP leader\u0026rsquos appearance at game seen as a milestone in cross-community engagementMembers of Defence Forces and families attend formal ceremony at Dublin CastleVictim (23) was rough sleeper, had cerebral palsy and spent time in foster careCyclists complain about broken bones following crashes on light rail tracksFresh appeal made for people to cooperate with Garda investigation of teenager\u0026rsquos murderDepartment say no legal obstacle to plan to use extracted kelp in place of pig antibioticsGarda\u0026iacute say Adam Muldoon (23) was known to sleep rough in Tallaght areaPedestrian fatally injured when he was struck by car on Rathbeale Road Sunday morningDublin Fire Brigade called to incidents in Saggart and Barnaslingan WoodNorthern Irish political parties lack courage to face Brexit, says former deputy first ministerAbout 100 far-right demonstrators urge UK government to get a move on with Brexit"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3542272.1529869811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s not my job to help theresa may on brexit says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: ‘It’s not my job to help Mrs May’.

An epidemic is a fierce outbreak of a disease. The word causes panic because it sounds fast and frightening, but it also implies that it can, with enough effort and money, be quickly cured. Pressure groups love “epidemics”, because they allow them to demand that governments must “act now”.

She loved it here, she really did. She is very upset that I am coming here without her.”On Monday, the Duke will visit an archaeological site at Jerash, echoing a photograph of the young Kate Middleton posing there on the rocks with her father Michael and sister Pippa. The Duke of Cambridge speaks to Alia Twal, the first woman pilot on Royal Jordanian Airways, as he attends the Queen\u0026#39s Birthday Party at UK Ambassador\u0026#39s residence in AmmanTackling the most serious issues facing the region in his first speech, hours after landing in Amman, the Duke said: We in the United Kingdom treasure our links with your Armed Forces enormously. The idea of service to one’s country has always been a value that we share.  From the Great Arab Revolt of 1917 to the battle against Da’esh today, our Armed Forces and security organisations have stood, and will continue to stand, side-by-side against shared threats and in defence of shared values.I greatly admire the resilience you in Jordan have shown in the face of the many security and humanitarian challenges that have confronted you as a result of conflicts in this region.The way in which you opened your doors to hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, not to mention your longstanding commitments to Palestinian refugees, is remarkable.  Prince William arrives in Amman, JordanYou should be enormously proud of what you have done. In so many ways, Jordan as an open and stable society is a beacon of hope for many other people in the Middle East.The tour will see the Duke focus particularly on young people, though, he conceded: I am now 36 so I am not sure that I can call myself young any longer.Kensington Palace has strongly emphasised the non-political nature of the trip, underlining its purpose in highlighting the culture of the region, and the hopes of its youth.The Duke will go on to visit young Syrian refugees in Jordan, as well as spending an afternoon on the West Bank including events that focus on the issues facing refugee communities opportunities to celebrate Palestinian culture, music and food and a chance to meet a number of young Palestinians.His first day of activities saw him visit FabLab, an initiatives to equip young people with technology skills, and deliver a message of  staunch and long held friendship from his grandmother the Queen at a party thrown at the British Embassy in her honour.Please review our commenting policyDouble the number of medical students to keep NHS afloat, health chiefs sayNew fathers turning down shared parental leave due to gender pay gapMilitary veterans struggling to adapt to civilian life because of MoD\u0026#39s \u0026#39tick-box\u0026#39 supportAttacks on postal workers in front gardens rises by 40 percent amid online shopping boomMusic video views to be counted in the official chart for the first time as YouTube takes on MTV\u0026#39s mantelDoctors living in fear of fatal mistakes due to NHS pressures, says BMASupermarkets to reintroduce paper bags for fruit and vegErdogan declares victory in Turkish elections as opposition \u0026#39concedes defeat\u0026#39Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman recruited by food giant in bid to counteract rise of veganismFrance arrests 10 far-Right suspects over alleged plot to attack Muslims, say prosecutorsPoldark, series 4 episode 3, review: does anyone else think there\u0026#39s just too much going on?Comment: Heathrow must expand, for the sake of the country Twitter\u0026#39s favourite shepherd quits government review of National Parks after three days due to \u0026#39cretinous attacks\u0026#39 from environmentalists Social media and gaming firms face a multi-million pound lawsuit for breaching children’s human rights, top privacy lawyer saysSecondary schools are introducing strict new bans on mobile phones Terror attacks in France: From Toulouse to the LouvrePrince Harry sparks beard renaissance as sales of facial hair care products soarComment: Erdogan may be chastened with his wafer-thin majority, but that won\u0026#39t change how he rulesBan on cannabis should be scrapped, chief constable says British ex-pat grandparents murdered in their Jamaican home, \u0026#39devastated\u0026#39 sons confirmWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"military veterans struggling adapt civilian life mods tick box2","story":"digitalservices@telegraphMark McDonald talks exclusively to The  about how he readjusted to civilian life after 23 years of service in the British ArmyMilitary veterans are struggling to adapt to civilian life, a charity has warned, as former service personnel criticised the Ministry of Defence\u0027s tick-box support. Many working-age service leavers feel “undervalued by society and misunderstood by civilians” with the resettlement process failing to address their lost sense of belonging, the study by Ssafa, the Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen’s Families Association, found..  The charity surveyed over 1,100 former service personnel between the ages of 18 and 49, for a new report titled The Nation’s Duty: Challenging society’s disservice to a new generation of veterans. Over three quarters of those polled (77 per cent) - all of whom had sought help from the charity - said they felt they were not fully prepared for civilian life with 19 per cent saying the resettlement package failed to provide them with suitable skills or qualifications to find a job. Sir Andrew Gregory, SSAFA’s Chief Executive, said: “Support for the Armed Forces means more than just supporting them during active duty, it means creating a welcoming environment for them to re-enter when their time is served.”Sir Stuart Peach has said wider society has too simplistic a view of those that had served their country.The report comes in the wake of comments by the outgoing Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Stuart Peach, who said wider society has too simplistic a view of those that had served their country.“The absolute majority of people who served in the Armed Forces return to fulfilling lives enriched by the experience. We are not all heroes and we are not all broken by service,” he said in his valedictory speech earlier this month.Gemma Morgan, an army veteran, told the : “The military puts huge effort into creating a separate society, a separate fighting force, for good operational reasons,” she added, “but sometimes the real world can be more complicated and there is often a reverse culture-shock and loss of that sense of belonging once someone leaves”.She blames the “tick-box exercise” of resettlement for not properly allowing veterans to create a new sense of purpose after their service. Instead of just writing CVs, those leaving military service “need the space to decompress away from the team to ask ‘who the hell am I?’” says Ms Morgan..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}The infrastructure is there so it’s just the content that needs to changeArmy veteran Gemma Morgan“If you still see yourself as a soldier after you’ve left, you’ll never transition.”“The infrastructure is there so it’s just the content that needs to change. This can be a quick win and we need to start doing it properly for the sake of the veterans.”Speaking exclusively to the , Mark McDonald, a veteran of 23 years service, revealed how he needed help transitioning back into civilian life having been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2005. “Once you leave the gates you’re on your own unless you ask for help,” he said, “and pride can be a problem sometimes.”“My pride got in the way of me asking for a mobility scooter, but my wife talked me into it. Now I can do the shopping or go with my son to watch his football matches.”He was shocked and angry to be told that as a former soldier his local authority wanted to do extra checks as part of his application to foster his son, in case he had been “institutionalised”.“Did they think I’d have my child marching up and down outside the house?” he asked. “Would they do this with a former policeman or ambulance driver?”Ssafa helped Mr McDonald with his financial planning after being medically discharged in 2013. He feels service leavers should receive such help as standard on resettlement courses.“In the military all your bills for food, accommodation and tax come out of your pay before you get it. It sounds basic but if you don’t know how to organise yourself with money you can easily end up thousands of pounds in debt.”New fathers turning down shared parental leave due to gender pay gapMusic video views to be counted in the official chart for the first time as YouTube takes on MTV\u0026#39s mantelAttacks on postal workers in front gardens rises by 40 percent amid online shopping boomDouble the number of medical students to keep NHS afloat, health chiefs sayDoctors living in fear of fatal mistakes due to NHS pressures, says BMASupermarkets to reintroduce paper bags for fruit and vegErdogan declares victory in Turkish elections as opposition \u0026#39concedes defeat\u0026#39Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman recruited by food giant in bid to counteract rise of veganismDuke of Cambridge hails Jordan as \u0026#39beacon of hope\u0026#39 for Middle EastFrance arrests 10 far-Right suspects over alleged plot to attack Muslims, say prosecutorsPoldark, series 4 episode 3, review: does anyone else think there\u0026#39s just too much going on?Comment: Heathrow must expand, for the sake of the country Social media and gaming firms face a multi-million pound lawsuit for breaching children’s human rights, top privacy lawyer saysTwitter\u0026#39s favourite shepherd quits government review of National Parks after three days due to \u0026#39cretinous attacks\u0026#39 from environmentalists Secondary schools are introducing strict new bans on mobile phones Terror attacks in France: From Toulouse to the LouvrePrince Harry sparks beard renaissance as sales of facial hair care products soarComment: Erdogan may be chastened with his wafer-thin majority, but that won\u0026#39t change how he rulesBan on cannabis should be scrapped, chief constable says British ex-pat grandparents murdered in their Jamaican home, \u0026#39devastated\u0026#39 sons confirmWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/24/TELEMMGLPICT000167464131_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLSGv7pEG7GdnqMy1yPX7OHGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"superman batman wonder woman recruited food giant bid counteract","story":"digitalservices@telegraphABP launches new superhero meat rangeSuperman, Batman and Wonder Woman are being recruited by a food giant in a bid to counteract the rise of veganism among young Britons.A range of burgers and sausages based on the popular superhero characters, made by one of the UK\u0027s biggest meat manufacturers, are being launched in High Street supermarkets from this week.It comes amid an explosion of Brits avoiding meat with around 3.5 million people now describing themselves as vegetarian or vegan.The trend is particularly catching on among younger generations who say they are cutting back on meat for moral and environmental reasons.  Food company ABP has signed a major licensing deal with Warner Bros to create the range of child-friendly superhero-themed sausages and burgers. Each pack carries either Batman, Superman or Wonder Woman branding, with the sausage range containing 56 per cent meat. Flavours include pork and baked beans and pork, cheese and ketchup.Wonder Woman television series in the 1970sABP said the sausages and burgers were made from British beef and pork and the burgers were also cut into the shape of each superhero logo.Kevin White, fresh foods editor at The Grocer said:  Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it\u0027s a Superman burger and it\u0027s coming to a supermarket near you very soon.A tie-up between DC Comics owner Warner Bros and red meat giant ABP sounds a bit left field but the pair think they are on to a winner with their new range of DC superhero-themed meat products.The range carries a \u0027Food for Superheroes\u0027 strapline and will \u0027create excitement for meat products in younger consumers\u0027 reckons ABP.With the meat category facing stiff competition from meat alternatives, it is a welcome piece of innovation and points to a new direction for the sector\u0027s major players as they seek to attract new shoppers.The range launched this week in selected Asda stores and will be available across the High Street supermarkets before the end of the year.ABP UK commercial director Darren Jones said: This is a first for the fresh and frozen meat categories and helps to create excitement for meat products in younger consumers.Warner Bros consumer products general manager Rachel Wakley said: We are truly excited about delivering our DC characters to fans in this innovative, fun and extremely tasty way.Double the number of medical students to keep NHS afloat, health chiefs sayNew fathers turning down shared parental leave due to gender pay gapMilitary veterans struggling to adapt to civilian life because of MoD\u0026#39s \u0026#39tick-box\u0026#39 supportMusic video views to be counted in the official chart for the first time as YouTube takes on MTV\u0026#39s mantelAttacks on postal workers in front gardens rises by 40 percent amid online shopping boomDoctors living in fear of fatal mistakes due to NHS pressures, says BMASupermarkets to reintroduce paper bags for fruit and vegErdogan declares victory in Turkish elections as opposition \u0026#39concedes defeat\u0026#39Duke of Cambridge hails Jordan as \u0026#39beacon of hope\u0026#39 -

When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is

That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.”1415 The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemingway“He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.”1515 Catch 22, by Joseph HellerIt was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But coming from the independent sector I think it would be good if all schools – states schools included – had more choice.”He claimed private schools were “not wedded to IGCSEs because they are more likely to result in higher grades” but because they are a “tried and tested success story in the lives of the young people we teach”.“They are not even included in league tables, so clearly this is not about showing off good results,” he added.\u0026nbspCambridge International Education, which sets the\u0026nbspIGCSE\u0026nbspexams, said it committed to aligning the standard of the\u0026nbspIGCSE\u0026nbspwith equivalent qualifications taken in England using “statistical evidence and comparability studies”.Around half a million 15 and 16-year-olds are taking the new\u0026nbspGCSEs, which have ushered in more difficult exam papers in most subjects, with a scale of 9 to 1 replacing the A* to G grading.The dramatic reforms come as part of a government drive to improve schools’, pupils’ and employers’ confidence in the qualifications, ensuring that young people have the knowledge and skills needed to go on to work and further study.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have reformed GCSEs to put them on a par with the best in the world so young people have the knowledge and skills they need to prepare them for future success and deliver the skills Britain needs to be fit for the future.“These new qualifications provide more rigorous content, greater stretch for the highest performers and are better preparation for studying A-levels, which are the main qualifications universities use when considering offers.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesHarry Kane celebrates scoring his second goal and England\u0027s fifth with teammates during their World Cup group game against Panama.

Opponents said it would also unfairly penalise people in social housing, as only they would be liable to be evicted.UK news in picturesDemonstrators at the People\u0027s March demanding a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in London, on the second anniversary of the 2016 referendum.Andria Marsh, 63, holds up photographs of her parents and her original British passport, following a Windrush service at Westminster Abbey in London.

To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded\u0027Mattha Busby and agenciesClick to followThe Independent OnlineEthiopians at a rally in Addis Ababa in support of the new prime minister, Abiy AhmedAt least two people have been killed\u0026nbspand others injured following an explosion at a political rally in support of Ethiopia’s new reformist leader.In a televised address after the blast on Saturday, which eyewitnesses said was caused by a grenade, Abiy Ahmed described the incident as “an unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united”.He said “a few people have lost their lives” and others were injured in the attack, that came shortly after he spoke to a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters on Meskel Square in the capital, Addis Ababa. Mr Ahmed has not yet blamed anyone for the blast, nor has anyone claimed responsibility, and police are investigating.“Love always wins,” he said. “Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded.” An Associated Press reporter said they saw more than a dozen injured people. Ethiopians have been heartened by a slew of reforms under Mr\u0026nbspAhmed and had come together in a show of support in numbers unseen in recent years in the east African nation. The rally has now broken up with people singing, chanting and going back to their homes. In a cowboy hat and T-shirt, Mr\u0026nbspAhmed had addressed the crowd in Meskel Square as supporters wore clothes displaying his image and carried signs saying “One Love, One Ethiopia”.Mr\u0026nbspAhmed told the tens of thousands of supporters that change was coming after years of anti-government tensions and there was no turning back. “For the past 100 years hate has done a great deal of damage to us,” he said, stressing the need for even more reforms. The 42-year-old entered office in April and went about introducing a swift package of liberalising reforms which surprised Africa’s second most populous country.He announced the release of tens of thousands of prisoners, the opening of state-owned companies to private investment and the unconditional embrace of a peace deal with rival Eritrea. “I’ve never thought this day will come in Ethiopia. I’m very emotional right now,” said Mulugeta Sema, a supporter of Mr\u0026nbspAhmed who wore a T-shirt with the new leader’s image. “We should never get back to dictatorship. This is time for change.” British man held on death row in Ethiopia for four years releasedEthiopia demands Britain return all country’s artefacts held by V\u0026ampAHowever, not everyone has supported the reforms. Some Ethiopians near the border with Eritrea have protested the embrace of the peace deal. Meanwhile, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, the dominant force in Ethiopian government for much of the past 27 years, said the peace deal had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She did not have any identification on her when she was stopped, which further complicated her situation.She was then transferred to a detention centre in Tacoma, a Department of Homeland Security holding facility, 125 miles south of where she first encountered the officers.Undocumented immigration across the US-Mexico borderImmigrant children, many of whom are separated form their parents, are housed in Texas\u0027 tent cityA two-year-old Honduran asylum seeker cries as her mother is searched and detained near the US-Mexico borderUndocumented migrants ride on the top of a freight train referred to as the beast, or La BestiaA cage inside a US Customs and Border Protection detention facility in TexasAll new agents must complete a months-long training course at the New Mexico facility before assuming their posts at Border Patrol stations, mostly along the US-Mexico borderA group of young men walk along the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border fence in a remote area of the Sonoran Desert714 US-Mexico border fence in the USMan looks through US-Mexico border fence into the US in Tijuana, MexicoUS Border Patrol agent Sal De Leon stands near a section of the US-Mexico border fence while stopping on patrol on in La Joya, TexasUS Border Patrol instructor yells at trainees after their initial arrival to the academy 1014 Memorial service in Guatemala Families attend a memorial service for two boys who were kidnapped and killed in San Juan Sacatepequez, Guatemala.

He urged Indians to be proud of their culture and history.“The gems of India’s unique heritage, such as yoga, will be respected by the world at large only when we ourselves respect our culture and traditions,” he said.Around the world, public yoga events were held in Afghanistan, Japan and Peru, while Australia and South Africa celebrated on Monday.“From Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions,” Mr Modi told participants on the lush green lawns.“In a world where non-communicable diseases, stress and lifestyle related ailments are rising, yoga can play a central role in mitigating these diseases to create a healthy mind and body.”In the buildup to Thursday’s event, Mr Modi took part in a social media campaign, begun by his BJP party ministers, to get people to share videos of their fitness workouts on Twitter.Celebrities\u0026nbspfrom Bollywood actors to sports superstars\u0026nbspgot involved, and Mr Modi’s own video showed him performing yoga on a boulder in his prime ministerial gardens.Social media was again awash with videos emulating Mr Modi’s on Thursday, including from staff at Delhi airport, pupils at thousands of schools and members of India’s armed forces.Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi’s party sweeps to key victoryPlea to Indian PM in London for ‘tortured’ captive elephants Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused of spying on citizens India PM makes point of visiting Palestinians after meeting NetanyahuThe Indian navy released pictures of sailors doing yoga on board the world’s oldest aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, decommissioned last year, and soldiers guarding the world’s highest battleground, the Siachen glacier in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, did yoga routines at an altitude of around 18,000 feet.The events clearly mustered a huge amount of public support. For some, however, there was a sinister edge to having public institutions take part in a scheme closely associated with the prime minister’s messaging. Even prisons were involved, with 15,000 inmates due to take part in yoga events on Thursday in the capital alone.Sagarika Ghose, a prominent journalist and political commentator, wrote on Twitter: “Believer in yoga, try every morning, immense benefits. But concerned: why does a GOVERNMENT need to promote yoga? Yoga’s an inidual choice, a personal option.”Mr Modi’s rule, she said, was “fast becoming an escapist Bollywood film where song and dance attempt to distract from hard realities”. One of the most liked responses to Ms Ghose’s tweet told her to “go to Pakistan” if she couldn’t show loyalty to India.For Ajay Mehra, a political scientist at Delhi University, the International Day of Yoga “has become an imposition”, forced on the people by government.“Something like yoga should not be part of a political project,” he told The Independent, adding that there were certain yogic practices – chanting mantras for instance – that could be offensive to some groups in a plural society, “Muslims in particular”.Mr Mehra noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, stressed the importance of secular, pluralist leadership while also being a devoted practitioner of yoga – “but he didn’t publicise it”.International Day of YogaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

Some came with their families, carrying babies and pushing elderly relations in wheelchairs. There were women in designer dresses, others in headscarves young men in World Cup football shirts, and some elderly gentlemen with traditional fez hats on their heads. All had turned up to vote in one of the most pivotal elections in Turkey’s modern history.“We are voting for our children’s future that is the reason we voted the way we did, we thought hard about it and I think we made the right decision”, said Nejat Bayan as he and his wife Pinar deposited their ballot papers. “There are a lot of things wrong right now, and strong action is needed, so these elections are crucial and we need the right result.”After supporting Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party\u0026nbsp(AKP)\u0026nbspall their adult lives, Mr Bayan and his wife were joining their daughter Buse in voting for the opposition Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP)\u0026nbspand its candidate Muharrem Ince in the parliamentary and presidential elections. And they were doing so in one of the staunch AKP loyalist centres in Istanbul, at a polling station, Piyale Pasha Elementary School, where a young Recep was once a pupil.Whether the move away from\u0026nbspthe president\u0026nbspand his party is a reflection of a wider trend remained to be seen. However, doubts have grown every day since Mr Erdogan called a snap election 17 months early, about whether he would win, with an opposition which has been galvanised and have shown surprising unity, co-ordinating tactics and directing their members to vote strategically.Mr Erdogan’s opponents claim that they may win the majority in parliament pushing back the AKP-led ruling coalition, and force him into a second round run-off in the presidential vote where Mr Ince is likely to be his opponent. State media later reported that with a fifth of votes counted in the presidential election Mr Erdogan was in the lead.World news in picturesSaudi women celebrate after they drove their cars in Al Khobar after the law allowing women to drive took effect.

Russian President Vladimir Putin walks before his President inauguration ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow.Victory would give Mr Erdogan more power than any of his predecessors after a narrow referendum win last year. That result,\u0026nbspmired in accusations of fraud,\u0026nbspconcentrated authority in the office of the president at the expense of parliament and the judiciary. The opposition want to review these constitutional changes which they claim\u0026nbspwill create an autocracy.Casting his own vote in Istanbul, Mr Erdogan maintained that the country was experiencing a “democratic revolution”. While a group of supporters in the street chanted his name, he said: “With the Presidential system, Turkey has set the bar high concerning efforts to reach beyond the level of contemporary civilisation.”Early estimates for voter turn-out were standing at as high as 85 per cent of the electorate in many areas. More than 56 million eligible voters can make their choices in around 180,000 ballot boxes around the country. But\u0026nbspit is what happens to these ballot boxes which have raised concerns about rigging of the results.“There are worried that there will be manipulation, the count would not be fair, the result will not reflect how well the opposition does” Sezgin Sari, a 29 year old translator of text books wanted to stress. “People are trying to prevent this, we have observers from different parties, the ballot boxes will be tracked: let’s hope all this works.”Within a few hours of the polls opening, reports were coming of alleged fraud by Mr Erdogan’s supporters. A video was posted showing a ballot box being opened in Suruc district near the Syrian border, and disturbances temporarily stopping voting in the area, where police also found four bags of stamped ballot paper in a car.Meral Aksener, the presidential candidate for the nationalist\u0026nbspGood Party (İYİ)\u0026nbspsaid: “We are urging the incident on Suruc very closely. I urge state officials to save the honour of the state.”\u0026nbspMr Ince declared, “We need 36 hours of mobilisation to ensure that there is no electoral fraud.”Foreign observers are in Turkey to monitor the election. Both President Erdogan and the Prime Minister, Binali Yildirim, had criticised teams from the West, including from the Organisation for Security Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) with Mr Yildirim claiming they\u0026nbsp“behave like spokespeople of radical political structures.\u0026nbspWe think this means interference in\u0026nbspelections one way or another.”Kurdish voters could hold key to Turkey\u0027s electionsTurkey opposition quietly optimistic ahead of presidential electionHow Turkey\u0027s elections will affect its struggling economyPost-Brexit, the UK will need Turkey more than everErdogan calls surprise early vote in June in bid to consolidate powerThe president and his supporters have avoided criticism, so far, from the monitoring team\u0026nbspfrom the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation Secretariat, which has Russia, China and India as members. The\u0026nbspofficials were inspecting polling stations in Istanbul and Ankara. Krishna Kengappa, one of the officials in Istanbul said a report would be produced on their conclusions on Monday.Some voters, while acknowledging the risk of fraud, were focusing on strategic voting. Ozlem Dinles, an artist, is backing HDP in the parliamentary poll, but will support Mr Ince of the CHP if there is a second round in the presidential vote. “The aim is to get change, move Erdogan so we must find a way to that through voting. I have become more and more optimistic that this is possible” she said.The optimism was also prevalent at a polling station in Nisahantasi, a middle class enclave and a firm CHP base. A businessman in the tourism field said, “When Erdogan called the election I thought it will all be over very quickly, with the first round. But the opposition has learned to work together and we believe a second round will take place and Erdogan will go.” His partner, a food writer, added, “Yes, this really is happening, we can see the opposition gaining support and Erdogan’s support slipping”. Neither wanted to give their names however, there is fear of retribution if the optimism does not turn into reality.For Bahri, a taxi driver, the removal of Mr Erdogan was wistful thinking by his enemies. “He is going to win, I know that is going to happen. Seven out of ten people who use my taxi say they will vote for him and I will as well,” he declared. “Europe had been stifling us, and now we are stifling them, and for that we need Erdogan.”\u0026nbspIt was nothing personal against Europe, Bahri wanted to add, “After all, I myself have just got an Oxford diploma in taxi driving.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

No customer ever asks for a fish using its Latin name.Another fishmonger who identified herself as Helen, said: If the ghosts of Ceasar or Nero turn up, they\u0027ll be pleased. If they somehow come back to life, at least they will know what the names mean.Few fishmongers in France apply the EU rule. The  said out of three fishmongers it visited in Paris, none of the fish on sale had their Latin names on display.The owners of the shops questioned said they had a blackboard with the Latin names of that day\u0027s catch and that it could be viewed upon request.Fishmongers in the famous Vieux-Port have been fined thanks to a rarely enforced\u0027 EU directiveThe fishmongers said they never received requests for Latin names \u0026ndash but all three said they complied with rules that disclosed the source and location of the catch, whether it was from a fish farm or whether it had been caught in the wild.But it seems the city\u0027s fish sellers may have official protection against the questionable rules.La Parisienne claimed Marseille Mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin had lunch with President Emmanuel Macron on Friday and told him about the fines.But, Mr Macron burst out laughing after he was informed of the fines and promised they would not have to be paid."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/turkey-elections-rigged-1393608.jpg","title":"turkey elections latest update erdogan Muharrem Ince

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is staggering that the ­Government is still undecided on ­fundamental principles.But the Tories’ woes were hugely exacerbated by their election calamity, caused in part by Remainers hoping Labour would betray Brexit.That emboldened diehards in the Lords and Commons — operating alongside the lavishly-funded, slickly orchestrated campaign colluding with Brussels to annul the biggest vote in our history.Meanwhile the national conversation has degenerated into a tsunami of hate, chiefly from sanctimonious Remainers branding Leavers uneducated racists.How much better off we would all now be if on June 24, 2016 they had grudgingly accepted defeat and pledged instead to make the best of Brexit.In fairness, some Remainers did. TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward. At next month’s pivotal vote, she must defeat the backbench rebellion hoping to shackle us to a customs union restricting our trading future. That is not Brexit, as voters would quickly realise. It would reignite the Leave ­campaign with unprecedented ferocity.And the PM and her Cabinet must not be derailed by Remain-fanatic businesses muttering about pulling out. Previous such threats have proved bogus, like all those dire economic forecasts.Leaving may not be smooth in the short-term.

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here. Sorry, I’m off’.“Never buy a car until you’ve attempted to walk out of the showroom at least twice.There is no better way to get the price down than to say, ‘I’m off, it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else.’It’s not so much calling their bluff. It’s calling them out.“It’s kind of like poker — and Theresa has to force them to show their hand.”Last week’s decision to pump an extra £20billion into the NHS — partly funded by savings from EU contributions — will also send a clear message to Brussels that Britain is leaving.Mr Duncan Smith said: “It’s a down-payment that says we have to leave.“It shows she knows we’re leaving and we won’t be paying them any more money after a set time.”But has Mrs May got what it takes to face down the Brussels bully boys?Mr Duncan Smith said: “I think she has the steel to surprise them.“We’ve seen before what she’s like when she really digs her heels in.

We know that over three-quarters of them find offers for sugary sweets and snacks at checkouts annoying.“It’s our job to give power to parents to make healthier choices and to make their life easier in doing so.”Last night the obesity plan received broad support.Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: “Having a takeaway or eating out is no longer a treat, it’s a regular part of everyday life, yet too often menus are information free zones.“Clear and consistent information on menus at the point of choice is the bold commitment needed to help families make healthier choices and avoid obesity-related health problems.”Some supermarkets already restrict sales to under-16s after calls from teachers and experts.Ministers must decide on a 16 or 18 age limit. Research shows the drinks can trigger unruly and dangerous behaviour.Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, added: “The plan crucially addresses the issue of children being continually exposed to junk food adverts when they watch their favourite TV shows and when they go online.”Chris Askew, of Diabetes UK, said: “With one in three children either overweight or obese before they leave primary school, it’s clear that bold, decisive action needs to be taken. Being overweight as a child can significantly increase your risk of developing serious conditions like Type 2 diabetes in the future.”But Advertising Association chief Stephen Woodford said: “UK advertising rules are already among the strictest in the world.“International experience and independent research has shown advertising bans have little impact on the wider societal issues that drive obesity, which is caused by the interaction of many complex factors and requires a multi-faceted solution.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today they do their socialising online – and like junk food, it’s highly addictive.“We’ve got to do something about this. That’s why we want schools to play a part in getting pupils in the habit of exercising regularly.”Mr Hunt who runs up to six miles, three times a week, said he wants to help parents to help their kids.“We’re not going to halve childhood obesity through government action alone. We can do a few things to help raise awareness but in the end parents have to take responsibility for the health of their children.“So part of this is helping parents to understand how critical their role is.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt included the ban in a raft of new proposals to cut childhood obesity, including a 9pm watershed on junk food adverts. Jamie, 42, who has campaigned alongside us for a ban, said: “I really think this was driven by the strong support of the Mirror and its readers. These drinks are not fit for kids and are affecting not only them negatively but also classrooms around the country. This is a great move for better child health but also a great move to support our teachers to help kids learn. We need to keep supporting this in the consultation.”  The ban on selling caffeine and sugar-laden drinks, such as Red Bull, to under-16s is included in Mr Hunt’s draft policy which aims to halve childhood obesity by 2030. Mr Hunt was appalled at figures showing energy drinks were being consumed by 25% of six to nine-year-olds. His proposals will be subject to consultation before a final decision. Mr Hunt said: “It is near impossible to shield children from exposure to unhealthy foods. Parents are asking for help. It’s our job to give them power to make healthier choices. The cost of obesity – on individual lives and our NHS – is too great to ignore.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour vows bring huge defence","story":"NewsLabour vows to bring huge defence contracts back under state control in major new policyShadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith will reveal the party’s plan to scrap deals with outsourcing giants - as she insisted Trident would be kept\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor00:01, 25 JUN 2018Updated00:03, 25 JUN 2018NewsShadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith will reveal the party’s plan (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBumper Ministry of Defence contracts will be brought back in-house by a Labour government, military experts will be told today. Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith will reveal the party’s plan to scrap deals with outsourcing giants in a bid to raise standards. The frontbencher will point to a series of disasters involving multimillion-pound contracts between MoD the private sector after the Tories hived off deals as they tried to save cash. Ms Griffith, who has held her post since October 2016, has said Labour would back sending more troops to Afghanistan to continue the fight against the Taliban. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr the party would not not reverse its decision to keep Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent despite Jeremy Corbyn’s well-publicised opposition to the programme.  The Welsh MP stressed it was party policy to support the nuclear deterrent, saying this was not the time to be “descaling” it. She said: “I think if you look at the world today it’s a more uncertain place than it’s ever been. I think if you look at the way the United States is not stepping up to the mark, I don’t think this is the right time to be getting rid of our nuclear deterrent. Vowing an immediate review of existing contracts and a ban on awarding new deals, Ms Griffith will tell the Royal United Services Institute think tank today: “The next Labour government will get to grips with outsourcing at the MoD. “Upon taking office, we will carry out a root and branch review of significant service contracts that have been outsourced by the Department. “And where they are not delivering, where they are failing our personnel and their families, or failing to provide value for money to British taxpayers, we will have no hesitation in bringing these contracts back in-house.  “And we will call an immediate halt to the significant contracts that are currently being considered for outsourcing, with Labour introducing a clear presumption in favour of public contracts being delivered by the public sector.” The pledge comes after the Government’s decision to hand a contract for the Defence Fire and Rescue Service to Capita, despite the company achieving the highest possible risk rating in an internal MoD assessment. The firm was recently stripped of its contract to run MoD military estates, while its deal to run for recruitment to the Army has been plagued by problems, leaving the Service 5,000 troops below strength. Meanwhile, Service families have repeatedly complained of broken boilers, rattling windows and mouldy walls in homes where a private firm is responsible for upkeep.

So what better time to explore the UK and take in some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides?\u0026nbspShareByHolly Thatcher14:24, 22 JUN 2018Updated21:07, 23 JUN 2018Advertorial (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe\u0027ve been blessed with some decent weather already in 2018 - but this week is when summer *officially* begins. June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is the longest day in the year - affording us approximately 17 hours of daylight. Technically, this also means that the nights will start drawing in again now - so there\u0027s really no time like the present to get out and explore the great outdoors on some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides. We\u0027ve taken a look around the UK to find the best places to watch the sun setting. 1. Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh, Scotland  A small village called Maud in Aberdeenshire offers a starting place for a traffic-free cycle to the coast. If you\u0027re in the mood to learn then head to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in Fraserburgh. The sun will set at around 10.12pm this week in this part of Scotland, so you\u0027ve got loads of time to enjoy the start of the summer. Bike need replacing?   If your existing bike needs replacing, you\u0027ll want something efficient and speedy for the roads - like the Carrera Parva Hybrid bike , which comes in versions for both men and women and is now just \u0026pound210 (a saving of \u0026pound90). And if you don\u0027t need a new bike, why not have yours checked over before setting off. Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear. Halfords offers a 32-point Free Bike Check which includes:  Frame, saddle and handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables  2. The Eden Project, Cornwall   Why not spend the day enjoying the amazing sights at the Eden Project? Best of all, if you arrive by bike you\u0027ll get a discount on entry. The sun sets on Eden at around 9:30pm on the solstice. Bear in mind though that the Eden Project shuts at 6pm, so you\u0027ll need to watch the sun go down somewhere nearby.  Get there in style on the Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound300. With easy to use 24 speed Shimano gearing, your effort for building speed will be minimised on all terrains, while its lightweight aluminium frame means you can quickly and efficiently ride to your destination. Camping out?   Planning to camp? Be sure you book in advance as you won\u0027t want to be without a pitch. Croft Farm Holiday Park is just a mile from the Eden Project and three miles from the beach. Pentewan Sands is also nearby and boasts amazing family facilities - as well as the nearby Pentewan Cycle Trail. Consider taking a Halfords Vis A Vis 4 Person Tent with you, which is currently reduced to just \u0026pound60, (was \u0026pound150, save \u0026pound90). The simple tunnel design is easy to pitch in approximately 20 minutes. With two separate bedrooms and a living area, it\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends. For additional comfort pack an Urban Escape Folding Table And Bench Set , \u0026pound40 (was \u0026pound50, save \u0026pound10) which folds down into a single carry case to make it easy to transport and store.  3. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales  The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is an absolutely beautiful part of Wales and a stunning place to watch the sun go down. There are loads of campsites in the area, including some unique places to stay. There are plenty of bike routes too, with some offering traffic-free options if you want a more peaceful ride. In Pembrokeshire you can expect the sun to set around 9:39pm. Why not try..   The Boardman ADV 8.8 Adventure Bike , \u0026pound750, is a bike truly made to help you explore new possibilities. This bike is adept at riding in comfort on roads but really excels when you want to get off the beaten track.   4. White Nancy, Cheshire   Located on Kerridge Hill, White Nancy is a local landmark from which you can see all around the area, from Wales to the west and the Pennines to the north. From time to time White Nancy is painted to look like other things, like a Christmas pudding or with Olympic rings when London hosted in 2012. The sun will set over White Nancy at around 9:36 this week. Need to drive?  Heading further afield to enjoy the sunny days? If you\u0027re packing up the whole family into the car for a camping trip, make sure it\u0027s in good running order first. A Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too.  If you\u0027re making an unfamiliar journey, don\u0027t forget to get the Garmin Drive Sat Nav , \u0026pound79.99 (was \u0026pound99.99, save \u0026pound20.99). With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road. 5. Edinburgh Castle, Scotland  There are few places that are as stunning as Edinburgh Castle, located atop Castle Rock. The views of Edinburgh from the castle are amazing, and a great place to watch the end of the day roll around. Sunset here will take place at 9:58pm. 6. Hampstead Heath, London  The scenery on Hampstead Heath always pleases the eye. This amazing part of London has views of every landmark you could hope for and it\u0027s a wonderful place to watch the sun go down. This will happen at around 9:18pm in the capital.   7. Osborne House, Isle of Wight   The home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is quite a sight to see. Accessible by bike (and ferry, if you\u0027re not an island resident), it\u0027s the ideal place to see during the day before you settle down somewhere to watch the sunset. If you\u0027re up for the cycle, Shanklin Chine on the west of the island is well worth an evening visit.  Do it with ease - and classic style - on the Pendleton Somerby Electric Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound750. With added electrically powered pedal assistance, it delivers 40 - 50 miles of range through a rear hub motor with speed sensor. This extra power is enough to guarantee effortless rides, taking the strain out of hills and making moving off from a standstill much easier. If you prefer, this bike is also available in a non electric version and in a range of colours - we love the mint green ! The sunset starts at 9:18pm near Osborne House and 9:17pm in Shanklin Chine.  8. Ness Point, Lowestoft    Ness Point is the UK\u0027s most easterly point. This makes it a great place to ride to on National Cycle Route 1. Make yourself comfortable on the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (half price) and watch the waves crash in as the sun goes down. Sunset is 9:16 at the UK\u0027s most easterly point.  9. Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Lancashire   With plenty of places to cycle in the area you could have an amazing day out in Blackpool. Start with a ride to the Pleasure Beach, and have some fun with the kids (or without them!) on the roller coasters. When all that\u0027s done you can have fish and chips while the sun sets on another day. The sun will go set at around 9:43 in Blackpool.  10. Cotswolds, England  Spread over six counties there\u0027s a lot to see in the Cotswolds. Consider taking a ride through the picturesque Castle Combe to take in the amazing houses and the stunning market square. The sun sets on this beautiful village at 9:26pm  Find your way by car - and beat the traffic   If you\u0027re driving to somewhere new then why not add a sat nav to your car? The TomTom GO 6200 , \u0026pound270, (was \u0026pound339.99, save \u0026pound69.99) adds real-time traffic information to the navigational benefits of a sat nav (smartphone required for this feature).   11.

Jade Brett-Moore shared the appalling photographs to encourage other victims of domestic violence come forward about the abuse they are suffering, after her ex Daniel McLean was jailed for four years for the countless attacks against her.  The pictures shared by the 23-year-old show how her whole body was subjected to vicious attacks, with McLean even using a deliberately-sharpened end of a metal broom stick to cut at her legs.  She told the Liverpool Echo she was overwhelmed and thankful that McLean had been sentenced.  It was like living with absolute torture and I\u0027m just so glad to be away from it now, she said. It was basically near enough every day for months and months on end. There\u0027s been so many occasions that I couldn\u0027t name them all. She said she wanted other people going through domestic abuse to know they can get the support to free themselves from the violent situation.  I\u0027d say to those out there that right now, whatever place and whatever you\u0027re in, you might see it as being impossible to break free, and while you\u0027re in it you just think there\u0027s no way of ever getting out of it and you\u0027re stuck in that. But no, you\u0027re not. You can break out of it and you can get help and support. It\u0027s important that you must break free of it. No one deserves to go through what they do. McLean once told his partner: I\u0027m going to rape you and throw you in the lake. After one vicious attack, he threatened her: It\u0027ll be me or you that\u0027ll be dead tonight. The brute also threatened to have her gang raped, punched her in the stomach when she was pregnant, said he would throw acid in her face and once used shards from a mirror he had smashed to cut her. Jade, writing after he was sent down last week, said: So this[McLean] is my babies\u0027 father, sadly, who most of you will already know because of his pathetic reputation. Who not only put me through five years, on and off, of hell, but who knew I\u0027d gone through hell with a previous partner who was convicted and justice was served. Really, I should have listened to my family back then and real friends who warned me. But he was adamant he had changed, so I gave it a last shot. I was his victim of abuse and torture.  Not only did I suffer from months of soft tissue damage, fractured ribs, mental torture for things that happened to me which were not my fault - I was slashed and whipped continuously, [suffered] cuts from numerous different objects to my temple, head and body, covered all my legs in black bruising, from top to bottom,.. I couldn\u0027t eat, I was losing weight rapidly and he knew I had an eating disorder... He absolutely destroyed my home I had, phones, TVs, every door, windows, cut all my clothes up, my childrens\u0027 memories destroyed, their belongings and things that meant everything to me. [He] kept me from friends and family, and refused help himself when I tried to get him to the doctor. He wasn\u0027t interested and shut himself away from his family when I tried and tried for him. McLean, of Southport, was jailed last week for four years after admitting two charges of assault and the breach of a restraining order. A new restraining order has been imposed, stopped McLean from contacting Jade for 10 years. A judge described him as a danger to the public and described much of the evidence as harrowing and examples of his obsessive and manipulative behaviour. Jade added: He wouldn\u0027t let me shower on my own or go the toilet on my own, in case I was sneaking someone else in. I wasn\u0027t allowed out anywhere I couldn\u0027t wear make-up or nice clothes because I was a \u0027slag\u0027. He called me anorexic, then said I was fat, always brought me down on how I looked, and that I was unattractive which made me feel so insecure, told me no-one would ever want me because of my life... He also harmed an unborn child by repeatedly punching me to the stomach, where I couldn\u0027t move for weeks, made me miss [pregnancy] appointments, as he was scared they would notice my body full of injuries.

Gatherings around the table are disappearing as the box takes over as the focal point, according to research firm Opinium. The number of families eating an evening meal together every day has dropped from 57% in 2014 to just 48% at present, the study found. Meanwhile, the number watching television together on a daily basis, typified by the Channel 4 show and its armchair critics, has risen from 49% to 54% over the same period. Nutrionists and experts in childhood obesity say the figures ring alarm bells in light of studies showing that families who share mealtimes are more likely to eat healthy food. Children who joined round the table were found to consume 125g more fruit and vegetables than those who didn’t, according to one study by Leeds University in 2012. Young people included in communal meals are also believed to perform better in schools and have superior fitness.

British artist, Ed Chapman, 47, created the portraits of well-known East Midlanders including Sir David Attenborough, former-Doctor Who Matt Smith and comic Alan Carr using over 3,000 discarded tickets. The 10 pieces took a whopping 280 hours to put together in total. Other famous names created include fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood, comedian Jennifer Saunders, and the late Sir John Hurt CBE, star of The Elephant Man. East Midland Trains commissioned the artwork to raise awareness of their new mobile tickets – which can be stored on your smartphone and save on paper.  Artist Ed Chapman said: “It was quite a surreal moment seeing all of these famous faces come to life in front of me from what originally started as a pile of discarded paper tickets. “The colourings on train tickets are unique and distinct, that once I started playing around with some they actually lent themselves perfectly to mosaics. “Not only are the images of famous faces from the East Midlands, but the craft materials themselves have each travelled on a different journey across the region, each with its own story from station to station. “Hopefully it will inspire a few people to cut down on their paper ticket use – or even create their own artworks.”  The artist from Darwen, Lancashire has previously produced a portrait of Jimi Hendrix made entirely from guitar picks, a mosaic of David Beckham from old pennies and even recreated tennis-star Andy Murray in carpet stains. Jake Kelly, managing director, East Midlands Trains, said: “What Ed has done with a few thousand old and unused paper tickets is pretty remarkable. “As well as bring a smile to a few faces, we want to use these artworks to raise awareness about the benefits of using mobile tickets. “In addition to saving time and hassle at the station, there’s a clear environmental benefit to adopting digital tickets.” “These tickets represent just one hour’s worth of paper tickets sold across our network, with over 28,000,000 tickets printed across the whole year. “By the end of 2018, we aim to have fully rolled out mobile tickets across the entire network and so significantly cut down on this number.” "},{"url":null,"title":"derelict chalet transformed luxury holiday","story":"NewsDerelict chalet transformed into luxury holiday apartment worth £850,000The once unloved Cornish chalet is now an opulent holiday home complete with a hot tub and heated outdoor shower\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMiles O\u0027LearyPippa Allen-Kinross16:04, 24 JUN 2018NewsImagine having breakfast with this view (Image: Unique Home Stays www.uniquehomestays)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA once derelict chalet on the Cornish coastline is now worth a small fortune after two property moguls transformed it into a stunning holiday home. Husband and wife team Katherine and Adam Wooler fell in love with the location of the abandoned chalet off Whitsand Bay, and rebuilt it from the bottom up after negotiating with Cornwall Council to overturn strict planning laws.  Called Seaglass , it comes complete with a natural spa, including a hot tub and heated outdoor shower with a beautiful view of the sea.   It also boasts posh skylights, bi-fold doors that look out onto the ocean, Cornwall Live reports.   The Wooler\u0027s rent it and last year alone raked in \u0026pound123,000 from holiday makers - who have even been known to touch down in a private helicopter. But they\u0027ve decided the time is now right to sell the freehold of the posh apartment as the family enjoys a new start in New Zealand. It\u0027s available to buy right now - but you\u0027ll need a cool \u0026pound850,000 in your back pocket.  Katherine said: The chalet had to be a similar size to the previous one bedroom chalet, but it was the size of the plot that really attracted us and the sense of isolation from the other chalets dotted along the cliff. It was initially our intention to live there but with the arrival of our baby, Ella-Rose, we decided to turn it into a holiday let. Having previously converted another chalet on the cliff into a holiday let, we were aware of the potential and growing demand in Whitsand Bay - also locally know as ‘Cornwall’s forgotten corner’.

Douglas Moreton travelled to Nizhny Novgorod for the game between England and Panama. He had appealed to supporters to give him a spare ticket for the Group G game via Twitter after bumping into ITV editor Dan Howells. Douglas had travelled more than 2,000 miles to stay in a hotel in Volgograd, the Bristol Post reported .  And the fan, from Bristol, missed out on a thrilling game which saw the Three Lions score five first-half goals, including a brace from John Stones and skipper Harry Kane, on their way to a 6-1 victory. It is not known if Douglas managed to blag a ticket after his appeal on social media. It comes after superfan Ian Perry paid \u0026pound170 face value for his match ticket to see England v Tunisia but had his view blocked by a TV cameraman. Ian, 42, who now lives in New Zealand, took his seat for the crunch clash on Monday evening.  The supporter, originally from Preston in Lancashire, said: I couldn\u0027t believe it. It was a Category One ticket as well.

Mum Kathryn Conn hit the headlines last week when she posted a video of her son Alex dancing after Harry Kane put England in front against Tunisia.  Football\u0027s ruling body ordered the clip had to be taken off Twitter because it breached copyright rules - as viewers could just about see blurred action from the family\u0027s TV in the background. Kathryn labeled Fifa\u0027s actions petty. But the furore did not dampen Alex\u0027s enthusiasm for the game, with the schoolboy revelling in the attention.  The young Tottenham Hotspur fan was up and dancing today as his hero netted a hat-trick in a huge 6-1 win against Panama. Alex, from Weston-Super-Mare, watched England\u0027s win against Panama with his dad Steve and granddad Richard. Kathryn said: Every time Harry Kane scored he was very excited. Harry Kane is his idol, so he loves watching him score. He celebrates whenever England score, but it\u0027s really special whenever it\u0027s Kane who scores. And Alex had plenty to celebrate today, with three from Kane as well as two goals from John Stones and a stunner from Jesse Lingard.  It\u0027s the first time he and his friends have been old enough to know what\u0027s going in, said Kathryn. They\u0027re loving it. Since the dispute with Fifa was reported by  on Tuesday, Alex has been the centre of attention at school. He brought the article with him to school, he\u0027s really pleased with it, said Kathryn. He loves it, he\u0027s not a shy and retiring type of kid.  After her video of Alex\u0027s dance after Kane\u0027s 11th minute goal on Tuesday night was deleted, she said: It just seems really petty that they\u0027ve got people monitoring the internet for things like this. It was a tiny little clip of a little boy celebrating something he really enjoyed.

Julie Banwell, 43, has spent the best part of a decade suffering debilitating pain, undergoing operations and taking up to 50 tablets a day. And the mother-of-three recently had her limb amputated, a move deemed by doctors the only option to end her crippling agony. Julie, of Newsome, near Huddersfield in West Yorks., stumbled on concrete steps as she took her then five-year-old son to school back in April 2010.  She had stitches in her knee but was diagnosed with the rare complex regional pain syndrome 18 months later. Julie, who works in education, said: I was an active mother and after a simple fall taking my little boy to school I haven’t been able to walk. There is no cure, just lots of treatments that do not help.  “I have been to every hospital across Yorkshire and had three knee operations, phyisotherapy, lidocaine infusions, acupuncture, steroid injections into the leg and even a spinal cord stimulator implant.  “I’ve had loads of blood clots and was having to take 50 tablets a day. I have had every painkiller you can think of.” But late last year, specialists at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary decided she must have the leg amputated.  Medics gave Julie only a 50/50 chance of the operation working but the surgery, carried out last week, appears to have been successful. I feel fantastic and I can’t thank everybody at the hospital enough for what they have done for me — they have been wonderful, Julie added. She is hoping the next step will be to have a prosthetic limb fitted. However, that too is beset with complications with Julie saying there is only a 50-50 chance of it happening. The mum continued: She added: “I’m very determined and would love to be able to walk again. I am just hoping that I can walk and have a life like other people.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sickening clip emerges teenage boys","story":"News\u0027Sickening\u0027 clip emerges of teenage boys abusing cancer-survivor gran — and they then share it on SnapchatDisgusted social media users demanded the youths \u0027have their mouths washed out\u0027 and they \u0027learn some respect\u0027 after the clip was shared widely online\u0026nbspShareByIan JohnsonBradley Jolly21:22, 24 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email This is the sickening moment a gran was abused by teenage yobs at a bus stop.  The vile youths swear at the cancer-survivor and compare her to a dog in the shocking clip.  The victim has been left traumatised after the abuse, in the clip Chronicle Live says was quickly shared on Snapchat .  It\u0027s now been viewed more than 300,000 times by disgusted social media users who have condemned the boys. Police are investigating the incident, believed to have happened in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear.  The pensioner, who does not want to be named, said: I hadn’t done anything wrong to them and they treat me like that - I felt a bit sick. Kids today are terrible - they have no respect for people. I\u0027d hate to think my children would go on like that but I know they wouldn’t. “You just can’t go around treating people like that. The grandma had left her home for just the second time in 10 months, having been in hospital.   Some Facebook users called for her abusers to have “their mouths washed out”. Another said they should undertake “mandatory national service” to learn respect.  “If they were my children, I’d drag them around to the victim’s house to apologise and make them work in the garden for six months,” said the victim\u0027s furious son. He added: She’s a lovely, quiet lady so where do kids get off these days by doing this?. “I was telling my partner today, once upon a time if a ball went into someone’s garden you would politely ask for it back. “But kids are going around swearing and doing this with no respect — they are a nightmare. “She was so proud to go back on the bus for the first time — she rang me and said ‘guess where I am’. “She was so pleased with herself, then she went out yesterday and this happened.”  “We will not let her out now because of this — she could have fallen over to get away and fractured her hip, and you don’t know what the consequences could have been. “But you just think of these kids, ‘how were you brought up?’.” Robin Armstrong, an actor and comedian from Tyne and Wear, was appalled to watch the 45-second clip and shared it with his fans. He said: “Abusing a nana is the ultimate no _ they are the heart of a family. “To hear her being called a dog and on the phone to her family, she’s worried — it is just sickening. “I was in total disbelief — I couldn’t believe the kids would do it. “I wish I was there to have sorted it. “As soon as I got the clip, I wanted to get it up there and find out who they are.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather britain hotter sahara","story":"NewsUK weather: Brits hit the beach for weekend heatwave ahead of \u0027hotter than Sahara\u0027 33C sizzlerA ‘Spanish blowtorch’ heatwave will send the mercury soaring to 33C in what forecaster are predicting could be the first of up to EIGHT heatwaves this summer\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHenry Vaughan17:48, 24 JUN 2018Updated17:55, 24 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain will be hotter than the Sahara desert this week as the country sizzles in the first of up to EIGHT heatwaves predicted this summer. A 10-day ‘Spanish blowtorch’ heatwave will send the mercury soaring to 33C from Wednesday - making it potentially the hottest day of the year so far. Temperatures will begin to rise from Tuesday after an already baking weekend saw millions flock to beaches and beer gardens up and down the country. Scores of people were out enjoying the sunshine as they watched England beat Panama 6-1 in the World Cup - and it looks like it\u0027ll be hotting up even further as England makes its way to the knock-out stages.  After a “marvellous” Midsummer’s Day at 27C, the Met Office forecast 30C by Tuesday and up to 33C on Wednesday and Thursday. Up to eight summer roasts are now predicted ahead – with each spell reaching at least 28C, according to AccuWeather, the world’s second biggest commercial forecaster.

The hottest day so far this year came in April when a temperature of 29.1C was recorded in London.  Met Office forecaster Sophie Yeomans said: We would expect at some point this week to beat that. We are going to continue with the dry and sunny weather for most places. Top temperatures are going to be on the rise.

The daredevil left locals stunned after spending around 20 minutes performing a series of yoga poses 200ft above jagged rocks.  Despite giant cracks and signs warning that the chalk cliffs could give way at any moment, tourists are often spotted dangling over the edge of the Seaford Head cliff, in Seaford, East Sussex, to take selfies. Photographer Wayne Spring, 51, has seen scores of people gamble with death at the edge of the cliff and branded the woman’s behaviour “ridiculous”.  He said: I find myself questioning people\u0027s common sense quite a lot these days, but this was just another level. It was absolutely ridiculous - at the best of times, I can\u0027t understand why anybody would go anywhere near a crumbling cliff above a sheer drop. But this was something else - I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes when she did the headstand. The thrillseeker, who appears to be in her 30s, performed a series of poses at the edge of the cliff, including standing on one leg and the \u0027downward-facing dog\u0027 pose.  Snapper Wayne added: Yoga\u0027s meant to be relaxing, but I can tell you that it wasn\u0027t relaxing watching her. There was a crowd gathered around me at the time and people couldn\u0027t stop gasping. The woman was so firm with her poses, it just goes to show that she was totally oblivious to the danger she was in. The cliffs are so unstable, they could collapse at any time. Nobody\u0027s would ever be able to walk away from that drop, no matter how bendy they were.  The edge of the cliff is fractured with cracks, and every year along the iconic white cliffs, hundreds of tonnes of rocks fall onto the beach below. For years there have been calls to install security fences at the top of the cliff to prevent people falling off the sheer drop. Wayne added: If you fence it off you might spoil the area but you can\u0027t rely on people to use their common sense any more.  I don\u0027t want the natural environment to be spoilt by a few idiots but if a fence stops them then so be it. I think they\u0027re uninformed. If you are not from the area you will not know about the dangers but people just need to use their common sense. The South Downs National Park Authority, who maintain the Seven Sisters cliffs in Newhaven, East Sussex, have said fences are impractical because of erosion.  Seaford Head is along the same stretch of coastline as Beachy Head, one of the world\u0027s most notorious cliffs. Last week a five-year-old boy was found dead with his mother at Beachy Head.

The book, which is available on Amazon Kindle devices for \u0026pound1.45, consists of eight pages and contains advice on what to do before, during and after you take creep shots. Called \u0027How To Take Creepshots: The Basics\u0027, the e-book was published by Lorenzo Giovanni who brazenly states: You can comfortably practice it without going to jail because it is LEGAL. The author goes on to explain how he thinks creep shooting is a healthy hobby and reveals he got into it when he was 12 years old.  I met my cousin\u0027s friend Vanessa when I was 12 years old. Vanessa had soft pale skin, a sexy curvy body, and a small juicy booty. I would watch her from my window with a Sony DCR-DVD108 Handy Camcorder and took dozens of pictures of her bending over, and reaching up to pull down branches, and her shirt would rise up and expose her tummy, he wrote. The book, which one Amazon reviewer has called \u0027disraceful\u0027, describes creep shooting as an art form. Its product description reads: Have you been interested in taking pictures or videos of those sexy young women you see at the mall?  You may think there\u0027s not much to creep shooting, but you\u0027re wrong, there is so much that goes into that a lot of people need to become aware of if they want to become a successful creep shooter. It goes on to reveal that the author is planning to post a second part which focuses on upskirting photos. Amazon declined to comment on the product. This follows news that a ban on upskirting is set to become law. The ban will be adopted as a \u0027government Bill\u0027 which makes it impossible for one angry MP to block, Downing Street has announced. No10 said the Bill will hopefully get its second reading - the first hurdle on the road to becoming law - before MPS go on their summer holiday next month.

The vehicle, which was equipped with machine guns and tyre-bursting blades for Sean Connery\u0027s 007, could now be worth as much as \u0026pound10 million.   Investigators from Art Recovery International, the insurance company to find the motor, would not disclose where exactly in the Middle East it may have been discovered.

He added: As there are many Aston Martins, it is very important that we get a shot of the chassis number, dp/216/1. This is what we are looking for, as it is very specific to the vehicle. The Aston Martin was stolen in 1997, some 33 years after the blockbuster was released. Its owner bought the car in 1986 for $250,000 (now \u0026pound188,000) and kept it in his airport hangar in Boca Raton, Florida.

Zsa Zsa, a stout and barrel-chested nine-year-old dog, beat 13 other canines to the title and won her proud owner $1,500 (\u0026pound1,130) and a trophy. Celebrity judges in Petaluma, near San Francisco in California, were impressed with the mutt\u0027s wrinkled face, protruded teeth and shower of slubber. It was a very difficult decision. We loved all of the dogs, said reporter and judge Jo Ling Kent.  It was a huge responsibility, and we are just so happy for Zsa Zsa.

But she faced fierce competition from Charlie, dubbed Zombie Dog, for his sparse hair and spooky look.  Rascal Deux was vying to win the gong for the seventh time but his crazy eyes and hairless look wasn\u0027t enough. A beefy exercise intolerant bulldog named Meatloaf (aka Snorlax) and a terrier with dreadlocks also wowed the panel. Zsa Zsa, like most of the contenders, has had a tough life. She was rescued from a puppy farm, where she was bred for five years. She now lives with owner Megan Brainard in Minnesota.  The organisers say the contest isn\u0027t to mock the pets. Instead, they stress the idea is to celebrate the diversity of dogs across the world.

But hours after reaching the summit, the passionate mountaineer would find herself huddled in the foetal position, praying “death would come quickly”. She feared she would lose her life on the peak like so many others before her. Charlotte was made of sterner stuff than she thought, however, and after two days battling unimaginable conditions, she made it down the mountain. It was just one extraordinary day for a woman who spent her life travelling the world and scaling the world’s most beautiful, and dangerous, peaks. Tragically, she died last month after falling down steps outside her home, at the age of 61. By the time she took on the challenge of the world’s tallest mountain, Charlotte had already scaled all 53 of the 14,000ft peaks in western US state Colorado.  Her amazing survival story was immortalised in 2015 film Everest, starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Scott Fischer, a mountain guide, Keira Knightley, plus Amy Shindler as Charlotte. It was on May 10, 1996, now infamous in the mountaineering world, that Charlotte and 11 other climbers who had scaled the 29,029ft mountain were caught in a blizzard as they began their descent. The party were well aware that on Everest, rapidly changing weather isn’t just an inconvenience, it can be a death sentence. They found themselves caught in a whiteout, meaning it was impossible to tell which way they were going. Despite having rapidly depleting supplies of oxygen, used to help them breathe in the thin mountain air, the group had no option but to stop. The freezing winds caused Charlotte’s contact lenses to freeze on to her eyes. It was then, as the temperatures dropped to -50C and the winds roared at 70mph, that Charlotte curled up and waited for the end.  For two days the mountaineers battled to survive as snow battered them on the Southeast Ridge. Charlotte later recalled: “We waited for that warm fuzzy feeling that accompanied hypothermia and death.”  The storm eventually cleared, but eight of the men and women who had journeyed up the mountain would never come down again, including Fischer. It remains one of the worst disasters to happen on Everest. More than 375 people have died trying to climb it.  Writing in the American Alpine Journal, Charlotte described the relief that followed the storm’s passing. “Miraculously, the storm abated. Half-frozen we staggered to our feet and made an attempt to shuffle off. “My knees kept buckling and I couldn’t seem to make headway.” Just yards from the relative safety of her tent, Charlotte collapsed. It was Russian climber Anatoli Boukreev, who returned with an oxygen tank and dragged her back to camp, who saved her life. Later, people blamed the tragedy on the commercialisation of Everest. But for Charlotte, it was a dark episode during a life dedicated to mountaineering. During the summer before her ordeal she had tackled two other climbs in the Himalayas exceeding 26,300ft, Gasherbrum II and Cho Oyu. An only child born in North Carolina, Charlotte was a self-described “Southern belle” with a lifelong love of the outdoors and adventure. After graduating from university, she fell in love with the Rocky Mountains and made the state of Colorado her home. There, she became a talented waterskier and found a job in mountain rescue, living among the peaks that were her passion. She described herself as an “eternal fun hog”. Yet her disastrous descent from Everest was not the only time tragedy would strike in her life. In 1993 her boyfriend Mark Bebie was climbing in the Canadian Rockies when he died in an avalanche.  Heartbreak would strike again in 2004 when her husband of four years, Reese Martin III, died in a paragliding accident. But the loss of two loved ones did not leave Charlotte bitter. “I was never mad at Mark or Reese for dying in their pursuit of living,” she said. And despite multiple tragedies on the mountainside, Charlotte refused to give up her thrill-seeking. In the 22 years of her life which followed Everest, she scaled countless others but never returned to the mountain that almost took her life. But when asked to reflect on the tragedy which defined so much of her life, she said: “A bunch of people went climbing, each with his or her own reasons. There were no heroes or villains.” Her friends were distraught when on May 24 she was found dead at her home in Telluride, Colorado. She had celebrated her birthday just two weeks earlier. Charlotte died after falling down 77 hardwood steps outside her four-floor house. It had a lift but, despite sometimes being injured from her many climbs, she refused to use it as she wanted to stay fit on the stairs.

However his AK Party had been expected to secure a larger win as voters went to the polls, and opponents have yet to accept the result. As counting went on, his lead over rivals got narrower, but he is believed to have secured the 50% required to avoid a runoff. Erdogan was at 52.8%, with 95.1% of the votes counted, broadcasters said. His main rival, Muharrem Ince of the opposition Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP), had earlier urged election monitors to remain at polling stations to guard against possible fraud. The vote has ushered in a powerful new executive presidency, putting more power in Erdogan\u0027s hands. Critics say extending his powers will further erode democracy in Turkey, which is a NATO member state.  Turks narrowly backed the shake-up in a referendum last year. Earlier today, a crowd of Erdogan\u0027s supporters chanted his name as he emerged from a school after voting in Turkey\u0027s largest city Istanbul, shaking hands with people amid tight security. Turkey is staging a democratic revolution, he told reporters in the polling station. With the presidential system, Turkey is seriously raising the bar, rising above the level of contemporary civilisations.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion the following year.“I don’t like to single anybody out but Robert Douglas played a massive part.“It’s difficult to say just how much he helped gelling the players together.“All the players and their wives and families were invited round to his all the time and that really generated the team spirit.“He really made sure the team was a real team and that’s not even talking about what he did on the park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7163e9578-397x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc jocky scott recalls winning league cup against celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn their 125 years, Dundee have five major trophies in their cabinet and, with almost 45 years since they last lifted silverware, it shows just how difficult it is to be top dog.Just like today, back in 1973, when the Dark Blues lifted their last trophy, managing to battle past the Old Firm was one of the biggest hurdles.Dundee legend Jocky Scott was part of the 1973 League Cup-winning side and says meeting Celtic in the final, rather than the semi, gave the side a completely different mindset going into the game at Hampden.Between 1969 and 1977, Dundee lost five Scottish Cup semi-finals to the Hoops. However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t. It was a good side with good players, individually and collectively.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players.

This will be Neil’s second year in charge and just like everything else he has a specific style he wants to play.“I think we saw, I would say, more than glimpses of it last year.“It is a style of play I think is entertaining to watch.“We have a very good young base to build on and I think if we build on that base it will be very exciting next year.”The 2017/18 campaign ended with a degree of disappointment as the Dark Blues fell short of their target.A ninth-placed finish kept them in the division and, with a year’s experience as a manager under his belt, Nelms is backing Neil to succeed with “just a few more pieces of the puzzle” needed to push Dundee to the top table in Scotland’s top flight.The American added: “Once again he can build on last season and with just a few more pieces of the puzzle we have quite a good picture going forward.“With what we’re doing with players at the moment and getting ready for pre-season, it seems like the season ended a week ago and all of a sudden we’re back.“This is the busiest time of the year for us, we are trying to get players in and do things to bolster the team and really get ready for the upcoming season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29ce2188d-453x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united boss csaba wont rush fyvie back early from serious injury","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo could wrap key midfielder Fraser Fyvie up in cotton wool for part of Dundee United’s pre-season build-up in a bid to make sure he’s fit for most of next season.Fyvie, who signed a new two-year contract recently, is still battling back from a serious knee injured that forced him to miss the second half of last season.And while the 25-year-old is keen to start full training when the new-look United squad report for work tomorrow after their summer break, Csaba may ease him back.He’s even prepared to see Fyvie miss the opening weeks of the season to make sure he’s 100% ready when he does return.“I hope, of course, he is ready soon but if by the end of September he is on the pitch I will be happy about it,” said Csaba.“He’s made a huge development. He is already OK and he wants to begin but I want him to take it a little bit easier because we want him for the long term, not two weeks.”Another of United’s long-term absentees from last term, James Keatings, will definitely be working with the rest of the squad right from the off tomorrow.The former Hearts and Hibs man has been out since early January because of a groin problem that required surgery.He’s been working over the summer, however, and is on course to be ready for the big kick-off next month.“Keatings is OK. Every second day he sends me a message saying I want to be training,” added Csaba.Still on the injury list are goalkeeper Deniz Mehmet and defender Lewis Toshney.Deniz will be out for several more months after his recent knee operation that followed the freak injury he suffered in the play-off win over Dunfermline last month, while Toshney’s condition will be assessed in the next week or so.He has yet to play under Csaba because of a knee problem that’s ruled him out since last October.“The one we don’t know how far on he is and is still in the recovery process is Toshney.“He’s made good steps forward but we have to see how the knee will react.”With eight new players and four fresh appointments to the coaching staff, there will be plenty new faces when the squad reports to their St Andrews training base tomorrow morning.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2cf82a90d53-374x564.jpg ","title":"end of an era as iconic dundee chip shop to close after 64 years","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn iconic chip shop is set for the “last supper” as it closes for the final time after 64 years.Dora’s Fish and Chip shop on Dura Street, which has served thousands of customers since opening its doors in 1954, will close for the last time on Saturday June 30.Owner Giulio Dora, 65, said his parents Peter and Matilde bought the shop after a “gentleman’s agreement” with Mr Forte, then proprietor of Forte’s Cafe.But now Giulio, who grew up in Stobswell, is retiring after first entering the chipper at the age of one.He served his first customer when he was nine and learned the trade from his parents, who also had premises in St Mary’s, Broughty Ferry and Barnhill.In his time he has served the great and good both living in the city and passing through – from jute mill workers to Dundee FC legend Bobby Cox, wrestler George Kidd and pop idol Donny Osmond.After a brief spell as a mechanic, Giulio returned to the family business in 1979, before buying the premises in 1981.He said: “This hasn’t been a sudden decision.“We will be sad to leave the customers after all their years of business, as well as the delivery drivers who have come in and out with our supplies over the years.“The Dora family has been associated with fish and chips for about 130 years since the family moved here from a village in Italy called Rovinaglia.“We have so many great memories of our time here.“The former Dundee United manager Jim McLean used to come in and check the players weren’t eating fish and chips after training.”Giulio added: “I’ve been amazed at the reaction from customers to us closing.“We had some Brownies come in recently and they told me I couldn’t retire – I was welling up.

well as parents just trying to get about with prams claim they are struggling in the face of vehicles parked on pavements and over drop kerbs across Inverness.MSP for Inverness and Nairn, Fergus Ewing, has now spoken out in support of the Transport (Scotland) Bill which is currently making its way through Holyrood, saying it promises \"radical measures\" to improve accessibility and prohibit obstructive parking.\"Inconsistent and obstructive parking is a nuisance in our communities and greatly impacts on our ability to easily get around by foot, and so it is critical we empower local authorities to tackle this important issue,\" he said.Today a coalition of disability and mobility organisations called on Highland Council to develop an Inverness Street Charter, setting out measures to improve accessibility.Produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in liaison with Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and Highland Cycle Campaign among others their \"manifesto\" \u0026ndash Putting Inverness Streets Ahead \u0026ndash identifies pavement parking along with other issues such as street clutter and shared spaces for vehicles and pedestrians as restricting safe access.RNIB campaigns manager Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"Elsewhere, after wheelchair user David Sansum, from Kinmylies, branded the parking situation in Inverness \"a nightmare\" in last week\u0027 HN others have taken to social media to share their own frustrations.On Facebook Paul Tuthill said: \"As a powerchair user I find this frustrating.

lot of problems for a lot of people,\" she said.\"It\u0027 selfish and it\u0027 dangerous and it needs to stop.\"However a resident of Bruce Avenue in Dalneigh who did not want to be named also claimed that in some instances, drivers were forced to park on pavements by the lack of any alternative.He said that it is often impossible to find a space and blamed Highland Council for not providing parking as part of new residential developments.Speaking about the situation in his own street he said: \"I may also add everyone parks on one side of the pavement, leaving the other side clear at all times.\"A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Regardless of whether parking provision is made for any property development this does not give motorists the right to park on pavements

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing

Jimmy Gray spoke out in support of Labour colleague and MSP David Stewart who is pressing for a new law compelling property owners to safely maintain their properties.Mr Stewart is contacting Highland Council chiefs to discuss his idea of regular surveys to gauge wear and tear, and to make owners carry out essential repairs.His proposal comes just a week after two people narrowly avoided being struck by falling debris in the city centre as Storm Hector hit.Earlier this year an apprentice stonemason also prevented another potential disaster when he spotted a masonry block hanging loose over Academy Street, apparently pulled loose by a banner attached to it.This week the Inverness Townscape Heritage project launched a new maintenance guide for owners of traditional properties, setting out key areas for them to consider, including the benefits of regular inspections.However Cllr Gray suggested a far tougher approach may be necessary.\"We cannot wait until there are serious injuries or deaths before stronger action is taken,\" he said.\"I\u0026rsquove been concerned for some time about the condition of buildings not only in Inverness but across Highland.\"We\u0026rsquove spent years

It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs.

Scotland international striker Miller.However, it is understood Miller won’t be moving to Pittodrie.The 38-year-old is a free agent having left Ibrox.Hibs, Motherwell, St Mirren, Dundee and Livingston are all targeting Miller.It is understood Miller recently held talks with St Mirren boss Alan Stubbs.He has also held talks with newly-promoted Livingston who are keen to offer him a player-manager role.Aberdeen reported back for pre-season training yesterday as the build up to the Europa League begins.Aberdeen remain in the hunt to sign Hibs’ out-of-contract midfielder Dylan McGeouch.However, they face competition from Rangers, Fulham, Blackburn and Brentford.Midfield is a position McInnes has already bolstered with three new signings in that area reporting for pre-season training at Pittodrie.Republic of Ireland cap Stephen Gleeson signed on a free until 2020.Former Peterborough United star Chris Forrester, a £200,000 transfer, penned a three-year Dons deal.Also reporting for duty was former Hamilton Accies’ teen midfielder Lewis Ferguson.Aberdeen and Hamilton have yet to agree a training compensation payment for the highly-rated 18-year-old who was also being tracked by Crystal Palace.McInnes said: “In an ideal world you would always want to get consensus and reach an agreement with the club.“Obviously, that is not going to happen now.“We have done our work and are

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton.

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Ultrafast broadband rolled out to

I accept your refusal to answer my question, and will not ask again.Your comments do, however, raise a \u0026#8216supplementary,\u0026#8217You say Scotland voted to stay in the EU. But it was not a Scottish referendum it was a UK one.Are you arguing that London, Newcastle and Bath should leave the UK too on the basis of the Brexit referendum?Do think, by analogy, that Donegal should be treated separately by Dublin, or even join Northern Ireland, since it voted against abortion reform in the recent Irish referendum, and appears to wish to have a regime in that respect similar to the one prevailing in the six counties?Or do you see nothing  politically relevant south of the Tweed or west of the Monachs?If so how, might I ask, do you square that with the terms of the Treaty of Union in 1707, which is the legal framework within which all this discussion should take place if it is to be held on the basis of respect for the rule of law?Those are in fact two questions.I’d be obliged of you could treat them separately: first, the \u0026#8216fragmentation\u0026#8217 issue and, secondly, the Treaty of Union issue.I am sorry to trouble you on a sunny weekend, but you yourself have, in the media, repeatedly emphasised the importance of these matters.Ian Mitchell.Reply from Mr Russell:Ian,Thanks – I have  said all I have time to say to you today.Consequently if  you are inquiring as a journalist, please contact my ministerial press office as this is essentially a governmental and ministerial query. I have copied in my ministerial private office.If you are inquiring as a constituent I would be happy to see you at my next surgery in Campbeltown but I cannot spend more time today on what appears to me to be a political attack , disguised as a question.Marie Claire in my office can fix up an appointment for Campbeltown which, given the usual pressures ,  will be of 15 minutes duration.For the sake of the record however I fully support the actions of my colleagues in the commons and don’t recognise your  rude and dismissive portrayal of them.No doubt you will now say that the SNP  will not answer your questions and make further references to our \u0026#8216Putinesque\u0026#8217 approach.I can only respond that no matter how much you wish to make yourself out to be a persecuted and neglected seeker after truth, the reality is somewhat different.In other words, good try but no cigar…….Michael Russell MSP.Reply from Mr Mitchell:Michael,Not one sentence of your reply even tries to answer my questions—which rather proves my point.I will not take up time at your surgery when you will, doubtless, have far more pressing business to deal with as this is, of course, not a constituency matter.If you wish to meet for an informal chat next time you are in town that would, as always, be a pleasure.On a procedural matter: do I understand you correctly to say that an ordinary member of the public like me – I am not a journalist – will not be answered if writing to a minister to ask actions taken in a ministerial capacity?If I am wrong, how do I address you on matters like this? Or how would I address a different minister who is not the  member for Campbeltownshire?Ian Mitchell.Ian,Of course you will be answered.Michael Russell MSP.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"volunteers sought to put vulnerable children first","story":"Who did you go to for advice when you did not want to talk to your parents?If you think you could be that inspirational adult in a vulnerable Campbeltown child\u0026#8217s life, a unique national mentoring scheme is appealing for your help.Children 1st, Scotland\u0026#8217s National Children\u0026#8217s Charity, is one of 13 organisations from across Scotland offering weekly mentoring to \u0026#8216looked after children\u0026#8217.This is part of the Scottish Government\u0026#8217s initiative \u0026#8216intandem\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 the first ever national mentoring scheme for this particularly vulnerable group.A \u0026#8216looked after child\u0026#8217 is described as one who lives at home but who legally requires intervention from the local authority to ensure their safety, well-being and protection from harm.Children 1st will provide the service across Argyll and Bute, beginning in Campbeltown this month.Maggie Farrell, mentor coordinator, said: \u0026#8216For many reasons, but often because of traumatic events in their parents\u0026#8217 lives, some children are not getting their physical, material or emotional needs met and many directly witness or live with the impact of addiction, domestic violence and serious mental illness.\u0026#8216A weekly mentor can offer a listening ear, a new perspective and fantastic opportunities to gain new skills and experiences which all help build children\u0026#8217s sense of independence and belonging.\u0026#8217Mentors in other areas in Scotland have said that they get as much from mentoring as the children do, with one commenting: \u0026#8216In only two to three hours a week, I can see the difference I am making.\u0026#8216It is very satisfying to see a child trying something new, having similar opportunities to their peers and beginning to grow in trust and confidence.\u0026#8217Another said: \u0026#8216We\u0026#8217ve all had role models in our lives if we think back.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.

Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week. A trail of arrows around the town is also planned and will link in with a Global Treasure App, a treasure trail organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership."},{"url":null,"title":"Scotland  39 s first   39 reverse vending machine  39  is at Musselburgh Iceland","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS Iceland store has become the first supermarket in Scotland to introduce a reverse vending machine in a bid to end plastic pollution.  These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Phonebox removed from centre of Haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7968842.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Ultrafast broadband rolled out to more areas","story":"              Ultrafast broadband is being rolled out to 59 areas of the UK from Monday, doubling the number of locations where the technology is available.

David Horne was managing director of VTEC and was handed the same title at nationalised operator London North Eastern Railway (LNER) as part of the transition.  LNER began operating the vital route between London and Scotland on Sunday after VTEC\u0026rsquos deal to pay the Government \u0026pound3.3 billion to run services was ended early because the bid was too ambitious.  In an interview with the Press Association, Mr Horne stressed that he \u0026ldquowas not involved in the 2013/14 bidding process and only joined the company at the beginning of 2015.  \u0026ldquoIn these circumstances, it\u0026rsquos absolutely the right thing to do, he said.  He explained that stability and continuity are \u0026ldquoreally important for LNER.  \u0026ldquoThe fact I\u0026rsquom transferring and everybody in the company is transferring will give us stability so we can remain focused on ensuring that we continue to deliver a successful train service for our customers, Mr Horne said.  With the transition date only announced by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling on May 16, LNER has had \u0026ldquoa really short period of time to prepare, he said.  \u0026ldquoNormally when you change a franchise you have a lot longer.  VTEC, a joint venture between Stagecoach (90%) and Virgin (10%), began operating in March 2015.  The firms agreed to pay the Government \u0026pound3.3 billion to run trains until 2023, but the contract was ended prematurely after they failed to achieve revenue targets.  LNER will operate until a public-private partnership takes responsibility for both trains and track operations in 2020.  The switch from VTEC to LNER is costing an estimated \u0026pound8 million, which includes marketing, rebranding and IT set up.  VTEC is the third private operator to fail to complete the full length of a contract to run East Coast services.  GNER was stripped of the route in 2007 after its parent company suffered financial difficulties, while National Express withdrew in 2009.  Trains were run by the Department for Transport for six years up to VTEC taking over.  On Sunday the first LNER service departed from Newcastle to London King\u0026rsquos Cross at 7.54am.  Mr Horne praised the customer service performance of VTEC under his leadership, noting that it recorded the highest passenger satisfaction score among all long-distance franchised operators in the Transport Focus autumn 2017 report.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom actually really proud of what we have achieved in those challenging circumstances because we have done a huge amount to improve the service that customers receive, he said.

Jim Monaghan, who was the spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan Campaign, will be paid around \u0026pound30,000 a year to help build a \u0026ldquosustainable coalition for \u0026ldquosocial change.  However, a senior party source blasted the move, saying: \u0026ldquoThis is an absolutely staggering decision that has stunned the party. Jim Monaghan is a wild conspiracy theorist who has defended convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan. Organisers are among the most vital party staff members, in charge of local campaigning operations and responsible for speaking directly to voters. This is like the SNP putting the cybernats in charge of door knocking. It\u0026rsquos utterly bewildering.  Labour advertised for seven organiser posts in February, three of which were to be based north of the border.  The job advert stated that successful applicants should have the ability to work with a \u0026ldquovariety of stakeholders and Monaghan landed one of the jobs. However, he has had strong ties to Sheridan, who is considered to be a toxic figure on the left.  The former Glasgow MSP, who used to lead the Scottish Socialist Party, won a \u0026pound200,000 defamation case against the now-defunct News of the World in 2006 amid claims he was an adulterer and swinger.  Conflicting evidence led to a police investigation and Sheridan was charged with perjury, after which a lengthy criminal trial took place in 2010. Monaghan was a defence witness in the trial.  A jury found Sheridan guilty of perjury, part of which explicitly related to a trip Sheridan and others made to a sex club in Manchester.  BBC footage on the day of Sheridan\u0026rsquos sentencing showed Monaghan clapping the former MSP as he walked to court. He had also previously carried out paid work for Sheridan\u0026rsquos then solicitor.  Monaghan was also a volunteer on the campaign to \u0026ldquodefend the politician and planned a book - A Parcel o\u0027 Rogues: The Tommy Sheridan Conspiracy - which he later abandoned.  He also acted as \u0026ldquonational press and media spokesperson for Solidarity - the party Sheridan helped form after quitting the SSP - before joining Labour in 2010.  Monaghan wrote at the time: \u0026ldquoObviously, there is a long and hard battle within Labour and it isn\u0026rsquot one that will even take place, never mind be decided, in the context of the current leadership election. I am confident that, for at least the next few years, it is best for me and for my community that I work within the Labour party.  In December, the Sunday Herald revealed that Monaghan was one of the warm up acts at a Labour event attended by UK and Scottish leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard. He read poetry on the night.  Asked last year if he still believed Sheridan was the victim of a conspiracy, Monaghan said: \u0026ldquoYes, absolutely.  Monaghan\u0026rsquos Facebook page stated that he started a \u0026ldquonew job as a community organiser on June 18.  In 2016, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) - the official body that considers potential miscarriages of justice - declined to refer Sheridan\u0027s case to the High Court.

Campaigners say the ban on MSPs visiting the holding centre in South Lanarkshire should be lifted, but the Home Office says that visits are generally only for MPs due to immigration being a policy area that is reserved to Westminster.  However, Glasgow MSP Pauline McNeill has said that the rule should be scrapped and MSPs should be allowed to check on the welfare of detainees.  She said that all MSPs should be able to make an annual visit in light of concerns that have been raised over the conditions and treatment of inmates.  \u0026ldquoMSP\u0026rsquos must be allowed access to witness the conditions in which people being detained in this country are being held,\" she said.  \"I\u0026rsquom calling for Members of the Scottish Parliament to be granted access to the site on an annual basis.  \"Members of the Scottish Parliament must be able to satisfy themselves that the welfare and health needs of the people being detained are being attended to.  \"By visiting the centre members would be fulfilling the normal duties and rights of elected members in any democracy.\"  Critics of UK immigration policy have expressed concerns about the length of time asylum seekers are held at Dungavel.  Reports on Dungavel have shown that dozens of detainees have been held at the facility for months at a time, and in some instances, for over a year.  The Sunday Herald previously spoke to former detainees, who claimed vulnerable people were held in prison like conditions at the site.  McNeill said Scottish Secretary David Mundell should use his influence to get the Home Office to lift the ban.  She added: \u0026ldquoI have serious concerns not only about the way the site is being run, but also by the attitude the UK Government is taking in regards to this issue.  \"I myself had to write to David Mundell on a number of occasions before receiving a response.  \"I am calling on David Mundell to support me in seeking annual visits for Members of the Scottish Parliament.  \"It is not acceptable that the concerns of Members of the Scottish Parliament about the treatment of people from the communities we represent are being ignored.

Pecked dry by the last surviving dodo.  Apparently this \u0026ldquohappy meal had festered under my pal\u0026rsquos stinking crypt for at least a year. It\u0026rsquos likely the clatty b***er even braved a bite \u0026ndash because, remarkably, this burger still looked exactly the same as it did on the day of purchase. If he had been inclined towards religious fervour, my friend may have chosen to place this \u0026ldquoincorruptible meat in a glass display case and pronounce it a miracle.  Although it is indeed miraculous that a happy meal\u0026rsquos free plastic toy may rot away before anything else in the box, there is little likelihood of any supernatural deity\u0026rsquos involvement. Neither was this burger made from some sort of magical \u0026ldquoholy cow \u0026ndash McDonald\u0026rsquos has admitted that each single pate is formed from the remains of around 100 doe-eyed bovine. That\u0026rsquos nearly a whole field \u0026ndash a super-value meal indeed if you get a thrill from counting how much death it\u0026rsquos taken to keep your belly full over the years.  So, if God wasn\u0026rsquot involved in this burger\u0026rsquos immortality, then what caused it? A recent US scientific study into fast food\u0026rsquos mysterious ambivalence to nature concluded that the key to its durable physicality wasn\u0026rsquot any Judeo-Christian sky spy, creepy chemical or powdered preservative \u0026ndash but simply a lack of moisture and specific atmospheric conditions.  This brings us smoothly segueing into religious perceptions of such \u0026ldquoincorruptibility \u0026ndash once a prominent, earnest and profitable subdivision of Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox lore. This phenomenon was fuelled by the once popular practice of exhuming bodies to check if they had decayed in a \u0026ldquonormal manner. Signs of unnatural preservation were often believed to be the work of an interventionist God, justifying the macabre yet still popular practice of putting beef jerky on display in glass tombs. These exploited corpses are no sleeping beauties waiting on a kiss, however.  WOULD THEY LIE TO YOU?  THE Roman Catholic Church has put hundreds of \u0026ldquoincorruptible corpses on public display, making up for this indignity by promoting these bodies\u0026rsquo previous owners to sainthood. Discovering these demigods often meant macabre Burke and Hare-style exhumations of individuals rumoured to have committed acts of miraculous endeavour. One day, Charles and Eddie of \u0026ldquoWould I Lie To You? fame may be dug up to check if Eddie\u0026rsquos glossy mane is still intact. Perhaps Charles will have retained the twinkle in his eye.  Yet, even if the soul-pop duo are found in good enough nick to perform their hit again, the Catholic Church of 2018 might not be interested \u0026ndash as incorruptibility is no longer a miracle. Even the Vatican authorities now admit that pious folk of past eras had clearly tried to help God along with the whole process. It seems many former Popes and saints currently rotting under the Vatican were subjected to the indignity of having oil and herbs inserted into their muscle cavities to aid preservation. Some were even dead at the time. Such saintly \u0026ldquoincorruptibles have even been reported to exude a sweet odour upon exhumation \u0026ndash yes, embalming fluids and exotic ointments can be particularly potent.  Historically, those thought to have performed miraculous deeds in life were quickly buried in multiple airtight caskets after death, such was the fervour for their inevitable sainthood. These were built of zinc and lead and kept above ground in crypts \u0026ndash environmental circumstances suspiciously favourable to preservation. They were later exhumed to much fanfare and fired into garish glass displays for the faithful to gawp at in holy reverence.  These bodies remained attached to their blackened skin and calcified muscle structure, but not their dignity. Now that the Vatican itself has denounced \u0026ldquoincorruptibility as evidence for sainthood, perhaps it\u0026rsquos time to end these voyeuristic horror shows once and for all. Such abused corpses have surely now earned the right to a dignified burial rather than simply serving as a grim public testament to less enlightened times.  WHEN THE ROT SETS IN  THERE are countless natural processes which aid \u0026ldquoincorruptibility in those who did not benefit of from casual DIY mummification by the early Catholic Church. For instance, long before the 20th century\u0026rsquos cretinous, ruinous adherence to gluttony, most Europeans either died from starvation or disease. Wasting was also accelerated by religious penance. Such a grim death relieved bodies of the moist fat reserves that will accelerate the current generation\u0026rsquos decomposition, but more importantly, it also wipes out colonies of gut bacteria which largely propel putrefaction.  Truth, as always, is more interesting than the myth. The cyclical reality of death is so simple and beautiful that Elton John even sang a song about it, Circle of Life. Of course, the lyric about humans being so wonderfully recyclable didn\u0026rsquot make the final cut as nothing rhymed with biodisposable. The verse about how we disintegrate in a manner that saturates the soil with a wealth of life juices and minerals to seed new life in joyous abundance made the 12 remix though. Limited edition release in Slovakia.  With such wonder evident, corpse deification seems an insult to mother nature, denying her built-in reincarnation process simply to prolong the vampiric myth-making of monotheism. The humiliating afterlife of bodily preservation is surely only ever acceptable when natural conditions such as alkaline soil or ice have played their part.  Somewhat exotically, some human corpses have even been found \u0026ldquosaponified \u0026ndash buried in lime-enriched soil that converts body fat into hard soap. A clean death indeed. Others are preserved forever, ironically it may turn out, thanks to past eras of seismic climate change \u0026ndash such as the famous iceman Otzi of Bolzano. Otzi is the only guy on Earth cooler then the Fonz. And, remarkably, even older than Henry Winkler was when playing the alleged teenager.  NO HURRY TO DISPEL THE ILLUSION  FEW would deny there is clear historical \u0026ndash and present \u0026ndash precedent of society\u0026rsquos most powerful, privileged and influential echelons bending the mindsets of the masses to keep their illusion of hierarchic superiority flickering.  However, when it comes to the generations of the past passing off \u0026ldquoincorruptible corpses as the work of God, the benefit of the doubt might be warranted. Bodily decay is a complex and unpredictable process and was likely often misunderstood.  Still, folk then could surely have asked themselves a logical question as relevant then as it is now: if God is behind such preservation \u0026ndash and is, assumedly, all-powerful \u0026ndash then why do \u0026ldquoincorruptibles cover such a wide spectrum of decay? Why don\u0026rsquot they all stay as fresh as Ant McPartlin after a shave?  It\u0026rsquos likely folk always wondered the same thing. Using the Ant of their time as the analogy. Or perhaps their tongues were tied by the knowledge of what happened to Galileo and others for questioning God\u0026rsquos mysterious ways in public.  As science now understands, bodies don\u0026rsquot all decompose at the same rate. This fact has clearly led to seismic misunderstandings throughout history \u0026ndash and is the likely origin of all European vampire myths and Haitian zombie culture. We didn\u0026rsquot always fire folk underground then forget about them. Sometimes, we\u0026rsquod check to make sure they were still dead.  The fact that \u0026ldquoincorruptible corpses can now be rather easily explained leaves a greater mystery, however \u0026ndash the endurance of belief in the phenomenon. Perhaps the answer lies in how the Catholic Church continues to propagate the myth. In 1975, Monsignor Gianfranco Nolli, director of the Vatican\u0026rsquos Egyptian Museum, put together a team of mummification researchers to preserve all their popes, saints and \u0026ldquorelics \u0026ndash sacred body parts dating way back as far as the third century.  This team was also responsible for one of the Vatican\u0026rsquos top tourist attractions under the city: the body of John XXIII, who looks in fine nick despite dying in 1963. The airless glass coffin helps, but so do the realistic wax hands and death mask. More than 25,000 people visit St Peter\u0026rsquos Basilica to see him every day, and many of these faithful servants truly believe the beautific state of his body is a miracle. Understandably, the church is hesitant to clarify the truth that he\u0026rsquod be better suited to Madame Tussauds.  Ironically, only one of the specialist embalming team which treated Pope John and countless other \u0026ldquoholy corpses is still alive. The others tragically succumbed to various cancers, with side-effects of toxic chemicals they worked with during their macabre efforts immortalising the dead speculated to be responsible.  The most famous instance of incorruptibility, which many believe to be the real McCoy, is that of Bernadette Soubirous who died in 1879. She\u0026rsquos the one responsible for a booming tourist economy in Lourdes \u0026ndash five million people a year \u0026ndash after claiming she was visited by the Virgin Mary. In death, Bernadette\u0026rsquos body was exhumed three times \u0026ndash but kept above ground after the third and final indignity before being \u0026ldquotreated and placed inside, yes, an airtight glass tomb. It couldn\u0026rsquot have worked very well as what most people think of as the word\u0026rsquos more remarkably life-like corpse is actually, like John XXIII, a wax cocoon \u0026ndash the real Bernadette lies festering somewhere inside. Perhaps she should join John in Madame Tussauds. It certainly couldn\u0026rsquot be any less garish a display than the gold and crystal reliquary in the Chapel of Saint Bernadette where she currently resides, her vulgar afterlife helping maintain the hypnotic spell enslaving the faithful. And, of course, keeping the coffers full."},{"url":null,"title":"Jogger detained for two weeks after accidental US border crossing","story":"              A 19-year-old woman who travelled from France to Canada to visit her mother in British Columbia says US officials detained her for two weeks after she accidentally crossed the border while jogging.

Mr Cruddas \u0026ndash a self-proclaimed major Brexiteer \u0026ndash accused peers of seeking to block Brexit by backing amendments to give Parliament a \u0026ldquomeaningful vote on the final deal and how to proceed in the absence of a withdrawal agreement.  The spread betting tycoon, 64, told the Press Association no deal was better than a bad deal for the UK and claimed peers had overstepped the mark after seeking to push through 15 amendments to the Brexit Bill.  He said: \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the Lords \u0026ndash it seems to me they exceeded their authority.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear to me they were trying to block Brexit, not trying to amend Brexit terms for the sake of the country.  He added that rebel MPs were \u0026ldquotrying to go against constituents.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos madness, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe should just get on with it \u0026ndash business needs certainty.

Remaining tight-lipped on Theresa May\u0026rsquos handling of the negotiations, he instead pointed the blame on rebel MPs, Peers and the EU.  \u0026ldquoPolitics is getting in the way of reality, he said.

The CMC chief\u0026rsquos comments come as Airbus becomes the latest firm to warn that\u0026nbspit could pull out of the UK in the event of a \u0026ldquono-deal Brexit, joining Square Mile firms who have already started shifting staff out of the City.  But Mr Cruddas \u0026ndash ranked 206th in this year\u0026rsquos Sunday Times Rich List and one of the biggest donors to the Vote Leave campaign \u0026ndash believes the City will hold firm on its position as a global financial centre after Brexit.  He said fears over an exodus of bank staff were overplayed after the EU referendum, but said the City needs to be able to trade freely with the EU even if firms lose their so-called passporting rights should the UK leave the single market.  \u0026ldquoI would like us to trade freely with our Euro partners as we do with the other countries around the world \u0026ndash the US, Middle East, Far East \u0026ndash and I see no reason for it to be any different.  CMC itself is putting in place contingency plans with a European headquarters in Frankfurt to run alongside its London HQ, but Mr Cruddas sees little need to shift staff to Germany, given its online focus.  Founded by Mr Cruddas with a \u0026pound10,000 investment in 1989, CMC began life as a foreign exchange broker and is now a spread betting giant with a stock market value of nearly \u0026pound600 million.

It is a historic moment for women who have had to rely on their husbands, fathers, brothers and drivers to run basic errands, get to work, visit friends or even drop children off at school.  The ban had relegated women to the backseat, restricting when and how they move around.  But after midnight on Sunday, Saudi women finally joined women around the world in being able to get behind the wheel of a car and simply drive.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom speechless. I\u0026rsquom so excited it\u0026rsquos actually happening, said Hessah al-Ajaji, who drove her family\u0026rsquos Lexus down the capital Riyadh\u0026rsquos busy Tahlia Street after midnight.

As for the male drivers on the road, \u0026ldquothey were really supportive and cheering and smiling, she said.  In a few hours, she says she will drive herself to work for the first time in Saudi Arabia.  For nearly three decades, outspoken Saudi women and the men who supported them had called for women to have the right to drive.  They faced arrest for defying the ban as women in other Muslim countries drove freely.  In 1990, during the first driving campaign by activists, women who got behind the wheels of their cars in the capital, Riyadh, lost their jobs, faced severe stigmatisation and were barred from travel abroad for a year.

Ahead of allowing women to drive, the kingdom passed a law against sexual harassment with up to five years in prison for the most severe cases.  Criticism against women driving has largely been muted since since King Salman announced last year that they would be allowed to drive.  With state-backed support for the move, many Saudis now say they support the decision allowing women to drive and see it as long overdue.  Not all women are driving at once, though. The overwhelming majority of women in Saudi Arabia still do not have licences.  Many have not had a chance to take the gender-segregated driving courses that were first offered to women only three months ago.  There is also a waiting list of several months for the classes on offer in major cities."},{"url":null,"title":"Polls open in Turkey   s high-stakes presidential election","story":"              Polls have opened for Turkey\u0026rsquos high-stakes presidential and parliamentary elections, which could consolidate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u0026rsquos hold on power.

Nia Griffith stressed it was party policy to support the nuclear deterrent, adding uncertainty in the world meant this is not the time to be \"descaling\" it.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn voted against Trident renewal in July 2016.  The Commons vote saw MPs back the replacement of the existing submarine fleet carrying the missiles with four new Successor submarines.  Renewal of the submarines for the continuous-at-sea deterrent has been predicted to cost \u0026pound31 billion, with a \u0026pound10 billion contingency fund also set aside.

Last month, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was understood to have written to Prime Minister Theresa May recommending that the UK increased its numbers to bolster efforts to counter the Taliban.

I know English people like Michael McIntyre and Nigel Farage, but surely even they can\u0027t find Danny Murphy interesting      Why does the BBC employ Danny Murphy he\u0026rsquos so biased I expect he walks lopsided.      Danny Murphy shut up, we this we that, BBC aren\u0027t biased are they.      Sorry but the English commentators are so biased man, You need to be as neutral as possible.....ridiculous man especially Danny Murphy      England are beating the Dog \u0026amp Duck yet Danny Murphy and his mate are still feeling the need to be shockingly biased with their commentary. Some of it is embarrassing.    Others came to the former Liverpool star\u0027s defence, arguing it would be normal for him to favour England.  Sam Plackett said: \"Why\u0026nbspis Danny Murphy being biased an issue? He\u0026rsquos an Englishman commentating on an England game for English TV for Christ\u0027s sake!\"  Steve Lynes added: \"I might not be Danny Murphy\u0027s biggest fan but I have no problem with him calling England \u0027we. He\u0027s English deal with it!\"      Why is Danny Murphy getting stick for referring to England as \u0027we\u0027 ?    Other countries commentators go crazy when they score.    I\u0027d also expect any ex Welsh player on co comms to refer to us as \u0027We\u0027 and go mental if we scored.  Some saw the funny side of the BBC analysis.      Danny Murphy just described Panama\u0026rsquos last couple of minutes as \u0026ldquotheir best passage, which is harsh on the canal.

The temperature began to rise yesterday, meaning hot conditions for the estimated 5000 women who took part in Race for Life events across the country.

Scottish Water has asked customers in Stornoway to use water \u0026ldquowisely after a prolonged spell of dry weather in the area led to lower than normal loch levels.  In Moray, the dry weather has lead to concerns over water supply levels at Badentinan Water Treatment Works.

Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos warming up for this week as high pressure drags up warmer air from the continent. Sunny and warm weather lasts until at least the end of next week.  Other parts of the UK, like southern England, are expected to hit highs of 32C.  Warm temperatures throughout May and June have been enjoyed north of the Border, but experts believe Scotland\u0026rsquos hottest day of the year will be beaten.  Dunstaffnage, Argyll, which reached 27C on May 28, was the highest recorded temperature for this year so far.

Now, however, the cost of electricity to power festive lighting will continue to be covered by the local authority after a new approach was agreed by councillors.                                                    Members of the Infrastructure Services Committee (ISC) gave the go ahead to a new policy aimed at ensuring a reasonable, consistent and safe approach to requests from community groups.        Hanging baskets, banners and bunting are also covered by the new rules, as well as attachments to street lighting columns, such as signs.Councillors heard the use of festive lighting, bunting, banners and hanging baskets can help encourage commercial activity in towns, add seasonal colour and help promote community events.ISC previously considered proposals which would have seen community groups covering electricity costs for festive lights, hearing there was strong opposition to this from local councillors and groups.Members asked officers to revisit the plans, setting up a working group to further investigate the potential impacts of the proposals.                                                                                                        An engagement meeting was held with groups in April where a number of concerns were raised and consideration of these led to changes to the proposed policy. Electricity supplied through the public street lighting network will not be charged for and the council will now perform technical assessments on the suitability of lighting columns and advise community groups after it had been initially proposed that applicants would have to perform these safety tests themselves.Applications for festive lighting installations can now be submitted by October 1.There will be restrictions on installations outwith main footfall areas, but an arrangement to allow the use of festive lights featuring the branding of commercial organisations will be extended by a year.ISC chair, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “The cost of electricity for festive lighting in Aberdeenshire is around £11,000 and that seems a small price to pay for the goodwill of communities making the effort to brighten themselves up and appear welcoming at Christmas – we recognise a lot of organisation and effort goes into this already. The excellent work communities do is clearly of benefit to the whole of Aberdeenshire and the cost is one we can bear.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"pupils enjoy kidsout event","story":"\t\tLocal youngsters enjoyed a fun day participating in a wide range of activities when they attended a Rotary KidsOut Aberdeen event held a SRUC Craibstone Campus recently.\t\t\t\tTwelve pupils and eight teachers from Ellon Primary School, along with two Ellon Rotarian helpers attended.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news.

However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

Orkney topped the table in Scotland and was placed tenth in the UK as a whole.While is the responsibility of businesses to make sure they are meeting hygiene standards, local authorities play an important role in ensuring food safety compliance, with enforcement overseen by the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland.Chairman of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, Councillor Graham Sinclair, said the results demonstrate constructive working between the Council’s Environmental Health team and the local business community:“We’re delighted yet again to see Orkney feature at the top of this survey.“This consistency speak volumes not only about the quality of the advice and guidance the council team provides, but also the commitment of local businesses to their food safety responsibilities and on providing safe premises and products for their customers.“It reflects very well on Orkney and on the quality eating and dining out experience for locals and visitors alike.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
