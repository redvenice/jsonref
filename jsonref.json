That in the country he has to be serious etc. \u0027That he comes to town to enjoy himself, and has invented a fictitious younger brother of the name of George - to whom all his misdeeds are set down.\u0027 Lot 160, Oscar Wilde, \u0027Confessions of tastes, habits and convictions\u0027, authorial manuscript, 1877, is estimated to fetch between £40,000 and £60,000."},{"url":null,"title":"US Navy mocks Iran experts building target ship social media post","story":"Share this articleThe 11-carrier US Navy is mocking Iran as \u0027experts\u0027 at making a dummy aircraft carrier to shoot at"},{"url":null,"title":"James Murdoch steps board News Corp disagreements editorial content","story":"Share this article It is not his oldest child Prudence or the next in line Elisabeth, who has found incredible success outside the family business in emerging media markets.It is not James, the son who has stood by his side for decades and weathered the fallout from the 2011 hacking scandal at News of the World and the 2016 sexual assault scandal at Fox News.It is Lachlan, Murdoch\u0027s older son, who is the \u0027golden child\u0027 according to multiple sources.And the empire looks to be his for the taking - but it is not clear if he is interested in the job.The family company and its future were the focus of a New York Times piece last year that provided an in depth look at the mogul\u0027s two sons while completely ignoring the lives and accomplishments of his four daughters.By some accounts, Murdoch\u0027s heirs are now battling behind the scenes for control of the empire, with the two top contenders appearing to be his sons James and Lachlan.The brothers have had a tumultuous relationship over the years which had become more frayed than ever of recent after Lachlan was promoted over his younger brother by their father, despite James\u0027 loyalty to the family company.Others claim however most of the children have soured on the notion of taking over from their father.The media mogul is the father of six children, who range in age from 61 to 16. The oldest is Prudence, who is Murdoch\u0027s only child with his first wife, Australian model Patricia Booker.She has held various positions in her father\u0027s companies but now lives in Australia where she is largely focused on raising her three children.Prue, as she is called by her family, has made it clear she is not interested in taking the reins and did not even attend college after graduating from Dalton in New York.That does not mean she would oppose seeing her second husband, Alasdair MacLeod, move up the ranks at News Corp - despite her protests about him working with her father, or her offspring - who are Murdoch\u0027s three oldest grandchildren - landing nice roles at the company.But as Vanity Fair reported back in 2008, Prue is in many ways the one link the family has to reality.\u0027She gets away with saying what the others won\u0027t, even things that the others won\u0027t think, and she takes the various family members much less seriously than they do themselves,\u0027 reported the magazine.\u0027This involves, not least of all, seeing her three oldest half-siblings - Elisabeth, Lachlan, and James - as, each in his or her way, master-race prototypes.\u0027It is those three who have long seem poised to battle it out for their father\u0027s media empire - Elisabeth, 50, Lachlan, 47, and James, 46.All three work in media, with Elisabeth currently experiencing success with Vertical Networks, a startup that provides app-based series that are produced to be viewed in cellular devices.The relationship between Lachlan and his father has run hot and cold over the years, but that all changed back in 2014 when Murdoch\u0027s older son returned to New York to work for News Corp. Now, he is the Chairman and CEO of the Fox Corporation.James, the youngest of the three, was the most loyal, staying by his father\u0027s side and joining News Corp shortly after he dropped out of Harvard.That devotion was tested however when Murdoch elected to promote Lachlan over James after he return to work in the US following an extended stint in Australia.The brothers already strained relationship only got worse when Lachlan informed James of this decision over lunch.James even briefly quit the company, but then ultimately decided to return before then exiting for good. Murdoch\u0027s youngest children are Grace, 18, and Chloe, 16, the New York-based daughters born to Murdoch\u0027s third wife Wendi Deng.Chloe is currently attending an Ivy League college while her sister attends private school in Manhattan.The ambitions of the two teenagers are unknown, but their fiercely intelligent mother has no doubt seen to it that the two get not one bit less than their older half-siblings.James, meanwhile, is a longtime environmental advocate. His wife Kathryn works at the Clinton Climate Initiative and the pair are known contributors to the Clinton Foundation.The couple last month endorsed presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden by donating $615,000 each to his campaign after previously donating to former candidate Pete Buttigieg.Rupert and Lachlan said in a statement: \u0027We\u0027re grateful to James for his many years of service to the company. We wish him the very best in his future endeavors.\u0027News Corp is one of the two major media conglomerates owned by the Murdochs, the other being Fox Corporation, which was established after The Walt Disney Company acquired the majority of 21st Century Fox last year.The two sister companies were formed following the split of the original News Corporation, founded in 1980, in 2013.James previously served as the CEO of 21st Century Fox but stepped down following the sale. Since then, he has worked at the helm of the investment fund Lupa Systems.News Corp also publishes major papers in Australia and the UK and owns the HarperCollins book publisher.     "},{"url":null,"title":"Councils infection hotspots launch action plans bid stop surge COVID cases","story":"Share this article Leicester still has the third highest infection rate in the country despite being forced to retreat back into lockdown in June, with 55.7 people per capita getting infected a week.Bradford, in West Yorkshire, (45.8 per 100,000) and Trafford, Greater Manchester, (39.3) round out the top five for worst infection rates.It comes as the Prime Minister today announced he was \u0027squeezing the brake pedal\u0027 on easing lockdown at a Downing Street press conference.Mr Johnson warned that Covid-19 cases have started to \u0027creep up\u0027 and as a result the Government has no choice but to delay planned further casings. The PM had planned to reopen casinos, bowling alleys and allow crowds at live sporting events by August 1. But that has been pushed back to August 15 \u0027at the earliest\u0027 amid an uptick in infections across the country.Mr Johnson also revealed that the mandatory wearing of face coverings will be extended to include galleries, cinemas and places of worship.Me Johnson said: \u0027With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control.\u0027On Saturday August 1 we had hoped to reopen in England a number of the higher risk settings that remained closed. Today I am afraid we are postponing those changes for at least a fortnight.\u0027That means until August 15 at the earliest casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and the remaining close contact services must remain closed, indoor performances will not resume, pilots of larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will not take place and wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted but ceremonies of course can continue to take place in line with Covid secure guidelines\u0027.He added: \u0027I know that he steps we are taking will be a real blow to many people, to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted or cannot now celebrate Eid in the way that they would wish and I am really, really sorry about that but we simply cannot take the risk.\u0027Mr Johnson said the the new rules on face coverings will apply from August 8, with the police being tasked with increasing enforcement in order to ensure members of the public comply.He said: \u0027We will also extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings where you are likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship.\u0027We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings and this will become enforceable in law from August 8.\u0027 The announcement came as it was revealed Covid-19 cases have risen to a seven-week high in England and the R rate could now be above the dreaded level of one in both the North West and South West amid growing fears of a second wave.Government statisticians today admitted there is \u0027now enough evidence\u0027 to prove Covid-19 infections are on the up, estimating that 4,200 people are now catching the virus each day in England alone.The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which tracks the size of the outbreak by swabbing thousands of people, said the number of new daily cases was just 1,700 a fortnight ago.One in 1,500 people currently have the coronavirus - 0.07 per cent of the population. The figure does not include care homes and hospitals.Boris Johnson today said they \u0027can\u0027t ignore this evidence\u0027 as he announced he was \u0027squeezing the brake pedal\u0027 on easing the coronavirus lockdown. Number 10\u0027s scientific advisers today also upped the R rate in the UK, saying they now believe it stands between 0.8 and 0.9. It had been as low as 0.7 since May.SAGE also revealed the growth rate - the average number of people each Covid-19 patient infects - may have jumped to above one in the South West, home to the stay-cation hotspots of Devon, Cornwall and Dorset.And they said it was likely to be equally high in the North West. Matt Hancock last night announced tough new lockdown measures in Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire.  Delay to easing English lockdown may not be enough, experts say | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Fuel tanker crushed plane horror accident airport Moscow left NO casualties","story":"Share this articleFuel truck rams into plane at Russia’s largest airport on the day international flights resume (VIDEO) — RT Russia News"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80ec36a439b4199517e687be8858518ed70a1844/0_66_6328_3797/master/6328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a11434b023d1aaf78a05a35657e080e","title":"ten years of photo reportage from libyan traffickers to mugabes zimbabwe","story":"On the French island of Porquerolles, 10 photojournalists backed by Fondation Carmignac exhibit their studies of hidden and intractable issuesTake the ferry from Hyères, on the French Riviera, to Porquerolles island, walk past the beach where Jean-Luc Godard shot the film Pierrot le Fou, wander through the government-protected, sculpture-dotted pine forest, remove your shoes and then descend to a subterranean gallery illuminated by sunbeams shimmering through a transparent swimming pool.Here, in Fondation Carmignac’s newly opened private museum, you will find a portrait of Rita. Rita was 17 when the photojournalist Lizzie Sadin photographed her. A year before, she was living with her family near the foothills of the Himalayas. A friend told her of a life of opportunity lying in wait in India, just a few hundred miles away. After crossing the border from Nepal, Rita was captured, imprisoned and forced into a life of sex work for visiting tourists. Rita’s eyes blaze into the airy calm of Porquerolles island.In 2017, Sadin, a former social worker in Paris’s périphérique, was the Carmignac photojournalism awards’ eighth winning laureate. On the basis of a two-page pitch, she received a €50,000 (£45,000) grant. She used the money to embed herself, with her camera hidden beneath her coat, in the shady dance bars of the Nepalese borderlands, capturing stories of modern-day slavery.Sadin is one of 10 photojournalists to receive such backing over the course of the last decade. To mark this milestone, Fondation Carmignac is exhibiting each laureate’s work in a retrospective titled 10 Years of Reportage, on show until 1 November 2020.With Rita’s eyes at its centre, the show is curated to urgently explore some of the biggest existential questions we face – the hidden truths of modern slavery, the cost of endless conflict, the consequences of habitat loss and the quest of freedom for those living under authoritarianism.“I came to Libya to document the humanitarian crisis of migrants trying to reach Europe through Libyan territory,” says Narciso Contreras. “But, actually, what I found is a market.”From February to June 2016, the Mexican photographer travelled through Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.He captured how Libya has become a human marketplace in which destitute migrants are bought and sold as they attempt to make their way to Europe.Contreras uses the exhibition to show the first images – taken on his iPhone – of a transaction taking place between traffickers, which helped NGO groups affiliated with Carmignac prove modern slavery was taking place in Libya.Contreras concluded that, far from trying to resolve the situation, “Libyan authorities were running, and profiting from”, the trafficking of people.Arctic: New Frontier – Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, 2018If you’re planning to visit the north pole, it might be a good idea to get a move on. On the basis of all authoritative forecasts, the ice of the Arctic will be gone by 2030, to be replaced by a water world created by anthropogenic global warming.Never before have two photojournalists simultaneously covered the irreversible changes that are taking place in the Arctic. That is until Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, working in coordination, created Arctic: New Frontier in 2018.Kozyrev followed the routes of the Russian Arctic ports, from the city of Murmansk to the Taymyr peninsula and the islands of the Russian Arctic. Van Lohuizen, meanwhile, started in the Svalbard Archipelago and followed the northern Arctic route through Greenland, Canada and the northern tip of Alaska. Each captured the expansion of the region’s ports, industrial forces and military sites – “a process that will change the map of the world forever”, Kozyrev says.The New Zealand-born photographer Robin Hammond calls Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe “a garden of Eden that became a hell to many of its inhabitants”. In the processing of taking portraits of Zimbabwe’s pro-democracy activists, Hammond was imprisoned twice. “They wanted to show me the terrible living conditions they have to endure,” he says. “But some were afraid for me, and warned me of the danger.”His portraits include the face of the activist Masvingo, staring out from a pool of darkness. Hammond hides his body, severely burnt after soldiers threw a can of lit petrol into a campaign office for Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic Change.Iran: Blank Pages of an Iranian Photo Album – Newsha Tavakolian, 2014In 2015, Tavakolian became the first female photographer from the Middle East to join Magnum, the photography collective. The year before, she was the Carmignac laureate for a body of work that explored, via moving and still image, the personal stories of her own generation – the Iranian millennials who have grown up in Tehran after the 1979 revolution and the country’s bloody war with Iraq.As a self-taught photographer, and when still a teenager, she took to the streets to photograph the 1999 student uprising in Iran, “spending a week scaling trees with a zoom lens” while militia marched through the streets.Her series here captures nine men and women, shot in and around Tehran, as they communicate the tension of “being marginalised by those speaking in their name”, Tavakolian says. In Iran, “they try to fit into a landscape they regard as not being their own. They, like many of the others they represent, adapt.”Seen together, the Carmignac Foundation’s retrospective is a stark reminder, in the midst of the bucolic beauty of the French Riviera, of the first world’s increasing responsibility to the poverty, oppression and vulnerability that is the daily reality for most people in this world.Carmignac Photojournalism Award: 10 Years of Reportage is on show until 1 November 2020 at Villa Carmignac, Porquerolles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb000a6f242e56ad078d12a2f012049b14c5bdba/0_228_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0fc53a3dbf774244adf20d2911d90d3","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The burial service of civil rights leader John Lewis, Black Lives Matter protests in Portland and the impact of Covid-19: the most striking photographs from around the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7a3fa6968dd18dda87947e4c3946e429c2bbf8/0_108_5552_3332/master/5552.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5428e0da6a3e0c6f22d6464b9b6904d0 720w","title":"ons says uk rail has effectively been renationalised during pandemic","story":"Change in classification, to be backdated to 1 April, prompts dispute between unions and operatorsTrain companies have been effectively renationalised on a temporary basis, the UK statistics body said on Friday, prompting a dispute between trade unions and private operators over rail ownership.The coronavirus pandemic and lockdown forced the government to take emergency steps to prop up train companies by assuming the financial risk of rail franchises, after passenger numbers dwindled almost to nothing.The Office for National Statistics has now written to the Treasury and the Scottish government to inform them of its decision to reclassify train companies as public non-financial corporations in the light of the measures.The change, backdated to 1 April, means rail companies’ borrowing will be factored into ONS figures on public-sector borrowing and the number of state employees.At the same time, train companies are not allowed to make timetable changes or change staffing numbers without specific government approval.State support for rail firms means almost all revenue and cost risk from the companies are “borne by the government”, the ONS said.The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, insisted the reclassification should only be seen as cosmetic, rather than a fundamental and lasting change in how rail ownership is structured.“This is a temporary accounting change that reflects the extent of government involvement in running trains during a national emergency,” said the RDG chief executive, Paul Plummer.“The Covid crisis presents a chance to move towards a new way of running the railway, where contracts put customers at the centre and the private sector’s track record of attracting people to travel by train in safety is harnessed to boost the economy, the environment and the public finances.”However, the transport union TSSA, which has consistently called for rail nationalisation, urged the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, to seize the opportunity to do so.“The Office for National Statistics has candidly exposed the truth about our railways – they are now in public ownership,” said the TSSA general secretary, Manuel Cortes.“I know that telling the truth isn’t this Tory government’s forte. However, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, must come clean and acknowledge that our railways are now in public ownership and take direct control of running them rather than continue to line the pockets of fleecing privateers with taxpayers’ money.”While the emergency measures are temporary, they come at a crucial juncture for the future of England’s complex rail franchising system.The government commissioned a review of the future of railways, following a string of failures of franchises that ended up being effectively nationalised, including the Northern network earlier this year.The former British Airways boss Keith Williams, who is leading the ongoing review, said last year that the government should take a “step back” from the UK railway, which could potentially be run by a new body."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16ba4aefb5e0f4f48a9dfea5d49a9a2865f445de/3_0_5901_3543/master/5901.jpg?width=1300\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=639c577d588428b52d4384c49a7bfed1 2600w","title":"mackenzie scott more money than she can count and glad to give it away","story":"With a fortune of $60bn, the ex-wife of Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, has barely dented it with her first donations of $2bnIn among the scenic walks, dogbabybaby-dog pics, black-and-white selfies and explanations as to what black-and-white selfies were originally for, I recently saw a post being shared to Instagram again and again.Created by a user called @emilyisliving, it explained, in simple terms and aesthetically pleasing fonts, why billionaires shouldn’t exist. The concept is far from a new one – my Bible studies are rusty, but I seem to recall something about Jesus chucking the e-commerce magnates out of the temple and that bit about a camel being more likely to pass through the eye of a needle than a social media tycoon is to get into heaven – but this post pressed the idea that being a billionaire is fundamentally incomprehensible, because the numbers are too massive for our tiny human brains to have any perspective on.I have always wondered how you might spend a fortune. It’s a common daydream. As a child, I was dazzled by the notion that people could have a million pounds, because it seemed so ridiculous now it’s a punchline for a joke about how much a pint costs in London.These days, I find the idea of being a billionaire as baffling as it deserves to be. As I base most of my knowledge of extreme wealth on Succession, being a billionaire looks as appealing as an impromptu game of baseball with the Roys.With impeccable timing, as her ex-husband, Jeff, prepared to defend the dominance of Amazon during last week’s congressional hearing, MacKenzie Scott, formerly Bezos, announced that she had begun the process of giving away the majority of her wealth.The 50-year-old is estimated to be worth $60bn and last year she pledged to “keep going until the safe is empty” last week, she named the recipients of $1.7bn in donations, in part, she explained in a post on Medium, because of “a idend of privilege I’d been overlooking: the attention I can call to organisations and leaders driving change”.The numbers are staggering and certainly transformative: millions upon millions given to traditionally black universities, to organisations working to fight climate change and economic inequality, to LGBTQ groups, to do with it as they see fit. Yet the mind boggles at the fact that these numbers, while only a start, barely make a dent in the fortune.There is still nearly $58bn left to go, plus whatever baffling interest continues to accrue. The numbers remain incomprehensible. Perhaps it will make more sense when the safe is truly empty.I love awards ceremonies so much that I will happily sit through the traditionally excruciating “nominations” show just to whet my appetite for the main event.Last week, those for the 72nd Emmys were announced by Leslie Jones, who seems to have a similar level of enthusiasm for this stage of the game as I do.I realise now that it is my equivalent of sport. The post-match “snubs and surprises” chat is what I imagine football fans talk about at the pub, except instead of discussing tactics (sorry, I’m very bad at this) and, er, substitutions (I did tell you), I’m shouting about Reese Witherspoon and Normal People.Witherspoon managed the impressive feat of starring in three massive, award-magnet drama series this year – The Morning Show, Big Little Lies, Little Fires Everywhere – yet was snubbed on the acting front for all of them. I’m sure she’s fine about it, given that her production company made all three shows, and they have been honoured in other categories, but still, throw her a bone, Emmys! Nobody does uptight as well as her.There were other notable snubs, for Unbelievable, and for Daisy Edgar-Jones in Normal People, with even Paul Mescal tweeting: “This only exists because of you.” (Connell and Marianne 4 ever!) On the plus side, there was a lot of deserved yet surprising love for What We Do in the Shadows and Unorthodox. Even better, the event sets up a big battle, as both Jeremy Strong and Brian Cox are nominated for lead actor in Succession, continuing the father-son feud that never ends.Excuse the ongoing Succession obsession, but the series was nominated for a mammoth 18 Emmys, with Variety declaring that it had “stepped into the Game of Thrones void”.One of those nominations went to Nicholas Braun, who plays Cousin Greg, a man so appallingly spineless that he will inevitably end up running the world. In the same week as he found out he was up for an Emmy, Braun released his debut single, Antibodies (Do You Have The), a crowd-sourced, tongue-in-cheek, punk-pop anthem about trying to find love in a pandemic.“Can you find a testing site Before you spend the night?” goes one line, which is both very funny and oddly depressing. Braun told Rolling Stone that his test for the antibodies had come up negative.Braun said boredom had driven him to songwriting. Succession’s third season was due to start filming in April and has been pushed back to autumn, although Matthew Macfadyen, also Emmy-nominated as Tom, was unsure. “I think it changes week to week – or day to day, really,” Macfadyen told the Hollywood Reporter. At this rate, surely, it’s only a matter of time before Shiv’s reinvention as a techno star."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30cae3e41b0b746777c9b06db73a47ace200d530/0_180_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4a96752c63fd48f9b913e6a2af8794","title":"week in patriarchy women lead men","story":"We have been taught that if we want to get ahead we should act like men. Perhaps it’s time we stop doing that Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter​ on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday.Jair Bolsonaro reckons he has mold in his lungs. Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, meanwhile, seem to have mold in their brains. Brazil, the US, and the UK have some of the highest death tolls in the world from Covid-19 thanks, in part, to their inept leadership.While the world’s supposed strongmen have done a pitiful job at handling the pandemic, strong women like New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern and Germany’s Angela Merkel have won praise for their handling of the virus. A new study published by the World Economic Forum now confirms what many have suspected: “Being female-led has provided countries with an advantage in the current crisis.”Because just 19 countries in the world are led by women, it’s hard to draw meaningful conclusions about leadership efficacy just by looking at overall Covid-19 cases and deaths. Instead economists from the University of Liverpool and the University of Reading “matched” female-led countries with their closest neighbour based on socio-demographic and economic characteristics considered important in the transmission of coronavirus. Germany, for example, was matched with the UK New Zealand with Ireland. Bangladesh, which has a female prime minister, was compared with Pakistan. Serbia, which has a female and openly gay prime minister, was compared with Israel.“Nearest neighbour analysis clearly confirms that when women-led countries are compared to countries similar to them along a range of characteristics, they have performed better, experiencing fewer cases as well as fewer deaths,” the study’s authors declared. “This is true whether we consider the nearest neighbour … or even five neighbours.”A key factor in a country’s coronavirus outcomes, according to this study, was the timing of lockdown “female-led countries locked down significantly earlier, ie when they were seeing fewer deaths (22 fewer) than male-led countries”.Why did female-led countries lock down earlier? The researchers suggest one explanation might be the fact that women are taught to be more risk-averse than men. At the start of the pandemic a number of male leaders seem to have thought it was macho to act like coronavirus was no big deal. Trump shunned masks and downplayed the severity of the virus. In the UK, Johnson boasted about shaking hands with coronavirus patients in a hospital before he himself was hospitalized for Covid-19. And Bolsonaro famously dismissed Covid-19 “as a little flu” – now his wife has tested positive for it and he’s complaining about moldy lungs.Another reason female-led countries have had a better response to the pandemic, the study suggests, is differences in male and female styles of leadership. Women are taught to adopt a more “more democratic and participative style” than men.It’s important to stress, I think, that the big takeaway from this study isn’t that the world would be a lot better off if it was run by women – there are plenty of awful female leaders out there. Rather, the big takeaway is that the world would be better off if more leaders exhibited what we have been trained to think of as “female behaviour”. For decades women have been taught that if we want to get ahead we should “lean in” to male power structures. We should be more assertive and more competitive. We should speak louder, self-promote more, and never ever say sorry. We have been taught that if we want to get ahead we should act like men.

Source: Friends of the Earth\u0026nbspLong-suffering residents of England’s worst hotspot, Chideock in Dorset, told the  they are ided on how to fix their decades-long traffic blight. Like many rural communities, they feel cut off from mainline railways or adequate bus services and rely heavily on their cars.But millions of tourists and business visitors also snarl up Chideock and other coastal villages on the A35. Only 550 people live here but it is the main tourist access route to the Dorset coastline and has a popular beach less about a 1.5km walk away. As a result, in summer 20,000 vehicles a day pile through.The A35 turns an otherwise rural retreat into an urban rattle and hum. A constant stream of cars, vans and lorries rumbles past lines of immaculately thatched cottages, two pubs and a village shop, the vehicles spewing out harmful levels of this invisible, odourless poison. The residents tell me most of the listed buildings are too old to have proper foundations and are being shaken.The village bus stop sits in the natural cradle of the landscape basin and pollution flows down the road and collects here. One resident said her asthma was made worse when she regularly used the bus stop, so she stopped. Resident Mansel Jones said: “A small number of people who live on the road are pushing to get a village bypass but it would destroy our village and just move the problem over into the fields nearby. Why destroy another beautiful piece of countryside? Once the bypass is built they can sell their houses for more. If you don’t like a busy road why buy a house on one?Another resident, Sue Griffin, said: “As a newcomer from busy London, I was amazed and then appalled at the traffic thundering through Chideock. My cob cottage lost its flank wall before I bought it – it literally fell down. No wonder. The vibrations are continuous.”Tony Peacock, who is deputy chair of the parish council and member of a working group calling for a bypass, said: “The HGVs come down the hill almost all day. There is pollution from the tyres, brakes, exhausts – various metals, PM2.5 and other pollutants coming off them. The buses do not seem to be commercially viable. The last bus back from London leaves at around 12pm, so that’s no good.”Resident Michael Moles has run the local post office and village store for 13 years: “There was a vote and a majority of the village rejected the proposal for the bypass. I think it would be disastrous for me commercially and for the pubs, cut off parts of the village and distress people who would live on the bypass. Do we enjoy the heavy traffic? No. But it’s not 365 days of the year, it is only at the height of the season, it is part and parcel of Chideock. My hope is the introduction of more clean propulsion of cars will address the question.”The mixed attitudes show the challenges many villages face as they confront increasing traffic impacts on communities and health, balanced with economic and transport needs.Chideock’s parish council asked Highways England to “detrunk” the A35 – meaning it would no longer be designated as a main link road – on grounds of road safety, traffic vibration, air pollution, congestion and village severance.Highways England said it had to consider if a route “fits with the intention for a strategic road network to link main centres of population, major ports, airports and stations, peripheral areas and provide key cross-border routes to Scotland and Wales”.The strategic and planning executive director, Elliot Shaw, told the council: “We work hard to mitigate those impacts through our management of the routes and in any enhancement schemes. Alongside this, we also need to balance the role that the strategic road network plays in providing accessibility across England and supporting long-distance travel and the economy.”West Dorset MP Chris Loder said the local traffic pollution problem had been overlooked for too long and he is reestablishing an A35 working group: “The British Lung Foundation have echoed to me the damaging effects of high levels of exhaust pollution and this must be a much higher priority in my opinion.”Simon Bowens, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, has proposed several alternatives to more road building. He said: “The government must end its damaging fixation on building more roads. You can’t justify this by planning to phase out polluting petrol and diesel vehicles and replace them with electric ones.“We need to go much further than just getting out of one type of car and into another. Investment in better cycling and walking should be part of a fair and green post-coronavirus economic recovery plan aimed at creating a cleaner, fairer future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3b075baa9b9a50e74c9c5a128562d4aad91eb58/0_0_6048_4026/master/6048.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e61eca88bef189a3a93320e8ec5d6d3 1010w","title":"alan parker a life in pictures","story":"Film director Alan Parker has died at the age of 76.

He’s here all week, try the overpriced burger. While we’re on the subject, sort of, a matchday programme has still been published despite the lack of spectators. Here’s what it looks like, for some reason pictured next to a pair of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s trousers.Thank God that ITV Sport used to pad out their interminable FA Cup final build-up with any old tat! Here’s another celebrity charity match, this time from 1988, in which Jimmy Tarbuck - forever immortalised by Richie Rich as “the cheeky chap from the ‘Pool, everybody’s pal, the jolly gap-toothed scouser with twinkle in his eye and a smile for every honest Englishman” - slots a fine penalty past David Frost.Back in the day, ITV Sport used to pad out their interminable FA Cup final build-up with any old tat. The very thought. Anyway, here’s a celebrity charity match played ahead of the 1987 final, featuring some neat left-wing interplay between Kevin Webster from Corrie and TV-AM sofawarmer Nick Owen, and the best goal ever scored at Wembley by a future director-general of the BBC. Enjoy, enjoy.Chelsea’s 1994 effort No One Can Stop Us Now was quickly rendered obsolete by events. Better remembered is this Britpop-tinged effort by Suggs. If nothing else, the couplet “We’ve got some memories  albeit from the seventies” demonstrates that the self-deprecating shtick of Three Lions wasn’t quite as easy to pull off as Baddiel and Skinner made it look.Footballers are far too cool  intelligent  rich to bother with FA Cup final songs these days. Those desirous of a good old partisan knees-up are therefore required to rummage through the old crates and see what hot seven-inch platters they can pull out. First up are Arsenal, and ahead of the 1978 final, they decided to Roll Out the Red Carpet, just in time for Bobby Robson and Ipswich to traipse all over it. The song starts out with the bouncy twang of Don’t Pass Me By, Ringo’s sole contribution to the White Album, before going even further downhill. A big plus point, though, for the eerie foreshadowing of this year’s final on the cover, the squad lining up in front of a completely empty stand.There’ll be no need for change strips today. Both sides will be turning out in next season’s gear, which means that one shirt will be synonymous with failure before the campaign has even started. I’m no marketing expert, the world has long passed me by, and furthermore am simple folk, but that can’t be ideal, surely? Anyway, greater minds than mine have done the maths, so here’s Arsenal’s bespoke effort for today’s big game ...... while Chelsea will be wearing this, with some additional “Wembley 2020” embroidery around the crest.Other matches between Arsenal and Chelsea have been staged. Here are six of the finest, not counting anything that’s happened in the last ten years, for reasons that will become all too apparent when you click.Those two previous Arsenal-Chelsea finals, then. Here’s what happened in 2002 ...... and here’s the story of 2017, when, looking back with the benefit of hindsight, the organisers seriously overdid it with the old ticker tape.The 1876 FA Cup final replay, then. That’s the one, you’ll remember, in which the legendary Arthur Kinnaird, captain of Old Etonians, picked up an injury and was forced to take over in goal, his sore tootsies a major factor in an easy 3-0 victory for Wanderers. We mention that particular game only because the attendance at the Kennington Oval that day, 1,500, currently stands as the lowest in the entire history of the FA Cup final. For reasons we really don’t need to explain, that record will be wiped from the record books at 5.31pm this afternoon.So yes, this fan-free occasion is going to be a strange one indeed. But then FA Cup finals aren’t supposed to feel normal. Would it have felt normal when Arsenal won their first FA Cup in 1930, the Graf Zeppelin hovering over Wembley, the 776-foot hydrogen-filled behemoth dipping its nose to acknowledge King George V? Would it have seemed normal when Chelsea won their first FA Cup in woozy 1970 technicolor, after the sort of stramash at Old Trafford that wouldn’t be tolerated these days, not even outside the Belt \u0026amp Haymaker on a hot Sunday afternoon? It hardly seemed like an everyday occurrence last year, either, did it, when Manchester City were making venison sausages out of Watford, and there were 85,854 people in attendance for that one, for goodness sake. You’re meant to feel uneasy, a little bit queasy, that’s the effect big sporting occasions have. They feel surreal at the best of times. Abnormality is the whole point. So let’s go with it.Today’s final, the 139th, could be a cracker. Arsenal face Chelsea on the big occasion for the second time in four seasons, and the third in total. They’ve won the previous two, as all-conquering favourites in 2002, then as underdogs in 2017. They’ll be underdogs again today, on account of Chelsea’s better Premier League season, and the fact the Blues trounced them 4-1 in last year’s Europa League final. But there’s not that much in it. Both sides can be scintillating in attack neither are much cop, if we’re being totally honest, in defence. Having said that, even though neither team is quite the finished article under new management yet, both are capable of all-round dominance on a good day, as their respective semi-final victories over Manchester City and Manchester United attest.A 1-0 disappointment, then? Perhaps finals so often are, never mind local derbies. But it could just so easily be one of those rip-roaring, to-and-fro goalfests as well. And listen, never mind last year’s 6-0, we haven’t had seven goals since Blackpool and Bolton shared them in the Matthews Final, so we’re more than due another. You fancy one of those? Yes, us too! OK, then: Arsenal, Chelsea, you know what to do. Be about your business! Entertain the nation! It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1485d0c414855296a898282c224ed91bf2e1dfda/0_152_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9fd49d6442b2d6d048f2ffb27567dd9","title":"nina sosanya this much i know my greatest regret is not having a dog","story":"The actor, 51, on her idyllic childhood, fixing clockwork devices and learning to be less scared of spidersMy childhood was idyllic.

I think Cummings is very smart where he puts his efforts. What I like about him is he has the ability to focus on the main things,” Bannon said, hailing the Downing Street strategist for his role in Brexit and Johnson’s 2019 election triumph.The comments were made during interviews for a book to be published on Thursday which investigates how unaccountable money, lobbying and data has reshaped British politics.Written by Open Democracy journalist Peter Geoghegan, Democracy for Sale documents how dark money has corrupted the democratic system and features several interviews with Bannon, although his comments on Cummings – made earlier this year – came too late for inclusion.Bannon has fostered extensive links to global far-right nationalist movements in an attempt to unite “the Judeo-Christian West”. He has also described UK Islamophobe Tommy Robinson as the “backbone” of Britain, defended Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, and praised anti-immigration French politician Marine Le Pen, among others.However, Bannon refused to say if he is currently advising the UK’s prime minister or has met Cummings. Last year evidence emerged suggesting close links between Johnson and the man who led Trump’s 2016 campaign. Bannon even claimed to have crafted speeches for the prime minister.The interviews throw up key similarities between Bannon and Cummings. Chief among them is the desire to reform the UK civil service. Bannon advocates demolishing it entirely, arguing the “administrative state needs to be taken apart brick by brick”.Dismantling the UK civil service is one of Cummings primary ambitions. At the end of June its head,Mark Sedwill, quit with Cummings reportedly then telling colleagues that “a hard rain is coming” for the service.Another common theme emerges with Bannon’s views on Brexit. “There is one choice: hard out, no deal. It won’t be disruptive,” says Bannon, who was fired as a top adviser to Trump in 2017 following white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia.Cummings is believed to have privately championed a no-deal outcome and the EU’s chief negotiator recently revealed that the two sides were “still far away” from agreement with less than three months to go before a 31 October deadline.Bannon urges Johnson to focus more on manufacturing rather than ensuring that Britain resembles a “Singapore on the Thames”, shorthand for a low-tax, lightly regulated economy.Politically, Bannon sees Johnson moving ever further to the right, developing “more economic nationalistic tendencies” and predicting that “Boris will adapt his policies to become more populist over time”.The former investment banker also says that by studying the reaction to previous financial crashes he knew there would be an inevitable populist rising following the 2007-2008 crisis.Bannon says he began visiting the UK frequently in 2013 and meeting iniduals like Ukip leader Nigel Farage and his supporters James Delingpole and Raheem Kassam, who would both be hired by Bannon to work for a British version of the rightwing news site Breitbart.Bannon also says he spent time meeting members of the Young Britons’ Foundation, described by some as a “Tory madrasa” used to teach young Conservatives the “dark arts” of politics.Bannon said that during 2014 he noticed the supporters on Farage’s campaign trial for the European elections were similarly angry to US protesters during the recession after the financial crash. “They were the exact Tea Party crowds of 2010, where we had had this huge populist revolt,” he said.Sensing the public mood, Johnson and Cummings came on board with Vote Leave, the official campaign to leave the EU.“Guys like Boris and Dominic Cummings came and they were very important but they were quite late to the party,” said Bannon, whose Breitbart resolutely backed the campaign to leave the EU.On the day that article 50 was triggered, Farage was filmed with a pint of beer thanking Bannon and Breitbart. “You helped with this. Hugely,” he said.Bannon also admits that he briefly met Aaron Banks, the insurance businessman who co-founded the pro-Brexit Leave.EU campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b518781a4a2b43b3fe4edf934fa2b960a01b0ef/91_0_2318_1392/master/2318.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eef2d23974426812e2de255dc1985cf4","title":"stuart bingham questions sanitised balls after victory at the crucible world snooker championship","story":"Stuart Bingham blamed sanitised balls for his struggle to get over the line against the qualifier Ashley Carty in an empty Crucible on Saturday.The former world champion, who had fashioned a 5-4 lead in the opening session in front of a handful of fans on Friday, went on to win 10-7 and become the first player to wrap up victory since fans were belatedly barred from the event.Although the World Snooker Tour stressed there are no additional protocols in place with regard to cleaning the balls, Bingham said: “I felt lost with the table and the balls. I don’t know whether they had been sanitised. I played a red near the green pocket, and screwed back past the blue pocket – I’ve never done that in my life. But it is what it is, and if it’s sanitised, you’ve just got to get on with it.”Bingham had turned his slender overnight lead into a 9-4 advantage, including coming close to his first Crucible maximum in the 11th frame, when he missed a long red after potting 12 reds and blacks. But local boy Carty rallied, taking the next three frames to reduce the deficit to 9-7 and leave Bingham with uncomfortable memories of last year’s first round clash with Graeme Dott, in which he let slip an 8-1 lead and eventually limped over the line in a final frame decider.Bingham, who eventually wrapped up victory with a break of 82, admitted: “It was all I was thinking about from the moment he started coming back, and I was very grateful to get over the line in the end. It made it a little bit harder knowing what can happen, that it can so easily slip away from you frame by frame. With the memories, I was getting a little bit anxious, so I was happy that I made a good break in the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1deb97738f282bdee01f7c3521ca54decc37b072/33_70_2494_1496/master/2494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3888b97efa1894be0707fdadf93658c0","title":"super league determined to step up as it resumes amid uncertainty","story":"Lockdowns, abandoned fan-attended pilots and Wolfpack’s withdrawal means league resumes in strange circumstancesIt has been four painstaking months Robert Elstone will be keen to forget. In mid-March, the Super League chief executive stood on the steps of Huddersfield’s John Smith’s Stadium and conceded he had no idea whether rugby league would return this year due to the threat of Covid-19.That Super League restarts on Sunday with a double-header in Leeds is cause for celebration for the game’s lovers. But, typically, there have been challenges on the road to resumption. Many top-flight clubs faced a bleak future when the competition was postponed and Toronto Wolfpack formally withdrew from the season restart on 20 July.That has been a blow for not only the transatlantic Wolfpack, who featured Sonny Bill Williams in their ranks, but for Elstone and Super League, too. Yet in the face of the local lockdowns introduced across the north on Thursday, Super League returns as planned.So what dictates success in his eyes for a season that, several months ago, never looked likely to be completed as clubs warned of grave financial ramifications from the pandemic? “It would be very easy coming out of four months of hard work to simply say finishing it,” he says, “but we have to aspire for more and hope for more.“I’m hopeful that when we get crowds back, we can maximise our potential and we owe our fans something in the sense of their loyalty. If we could get 65,000 fans into Old Trafford on 28 November for the Grand Final, I would shake your hand right now.”News of fan-attended pilot events being postponed may yet scupper those ambitions, but Elstone is determined to build on what was achieved in 2019 despite the ongoing uncertainty.The competition is entering a crucial period since its flagship broadcast deal with Sky is up for renewal, starting with the month of August. The restart date was earmarked by Sky Sports due to the later-than-planned football off-season, leaving a window for another sport to step up and deliver.Elstone is acutely aware of the opportunity presented to a sport that has craved attention for decades. “Sky felt this weekend was best for their schedule and that’s exactly why we’ve done it this way,” he says.Throughout this month, games will be played as weekend double and triple-header events in Leeds and St Helens, giving Super League more exposure than it is perhaps could have expected. But these are far from ordinary times.“The postponement of the season and the lockdown has presented challenges all across the board,” Elstone says. “Nobody knew how long this virus would run and clearly we’re not out of the woods. As the weeks have gone on though, we’ve been able to tick the boxes required of us.”The biggest challenge has undoubtedly been integrating the competition’s two overseas teams. Toronto have now gone for 2020 at least – with discussions set to continue in the coming weeks about a return – but Catalans Dragons have committed to the remainder of the season, bringing with them a litany of logistical challenges flying teams in and out of the south of France as the pandemic continues to unfold.“Catalans have been given an exemption from French government in regards to being clear of quarantine issues should an outbreak arise,” Elstone says. “How robust that would remain if the circumstances became more extreme, I don’t know.”With 22 rounds, a Challenge Cup and a play-off series to squeeze in before the Grand Final, Super League can clearly ill-afford any more delays or setbacks.When St Helens face Catalans and then before Leeds take on Huddersfield at Headingley, it certainly will be rugby league, but not quite as we know it.

Campher tries to do the same but the spinner is down quickly to field nicely off his own bowling. It takes until the final ball of the set for him to get down the other end, beating Banton at midwicket. Very tidy.38th over: Ireland 136-6 (Campher 30, Singh 14) Very good shout for lbw, Mahmood slipping past Campher’s inside edge. Looked very good but Morgan declined to review and Morgan knows best - it was doing too much, missing leg stump. Three singles plus the leg bye, a pretty useful over there from the young quick. Kevin Pietersen is talking down to Rob Key on telly. Does he not realise that Key is the senior man in this broadcasting partnership? In fact, almost certainly not.37th over: Ireland 132-6 (Campher 29, Singh 12) Moeen to Campher, who takes the one on offer down the ground, Singh doing likewise but after three dots balls are raced through between times. Campher keeps the strike. Time to shift gears. A suggestion from Paul Haynes: “If OBO readers sensing controversy around dropping Billings in the near future – or “Billingsgate” - are referred to as “Billingsgaters” then what about those sensing controversy about Ali being dropped? Let’s not even mention the possibility that Billings or Ali are replaced by Old Harrovians Gary Ballance or Nick Compton!” 36th over: Ireland 130-6 (Campher 28, Singh 11) Saqid Mahmood is spun around to follow Rashid, now from the Pavilion End. Campher continues to take responsibility for the bulk of the scoring with his straightforward technique, taking an almighty swipe at a short ball, top-edging over Bairstow for a couple. The problem persists for Ireland though: it was one only two scoring shots across the over. DRINKS are on the field with 14 overs remaining in the innings. 35th over: Ireland 125-6 (Campher 26, Singh 10) Campher again, this time going back to Moeen and pulling hard and into the gap. With 15 overs to go, the new man has to be there at the end for Ireland to have any chance of sneaking over 200. 34th over: Ireland 119-6 (Campher 20, Singh 10) Rashid completes his set, 334 from his ten. Most of those runs leaked in the last few of his overs after ripping through Ireland’s middle order. Another fine performance from the 32-year-old. Credit to Campher, who, staring down the barrell of another quiet over, took the initiative by walking down at the legspinner and hitting him over his head for four. 33rd over: Ireland 114-6 (Campher 15, Singh 10) Five easy singles to the sweepers off Moeen - at last! Dare I say it, Ireland have looked overwhelmed - like a second-tier team - in both batting innings. They have been, and are, so much better than this. “Just read the Jonathan Liew piece on the infamous BBQ mural as instructed,” says Brian Withington. “Shane’s World meets Dizzie and Warnie’s Excellent Adventure. Almost painfully funny reading, that was only missing our hero playing Twister with Death whilst demonstrating his latest ‘mystery ball?’” I remember where I was when first reading it: on a bus from Oval to Peckham. The other patrons must have thought I was on another planet, sobbing with laughter.32nd over: Ireland 109-6 (Campher 12, Singh 8) Before the leg before shout (and the one before it, which they didn’t review), Singh swept him expertly behind square for four. That’s more like it - Ireland can’t afford to just limp to the finish line here. NOT OUT! The ball hit Singh outside the line when sweeping, and was going over the stumps in any case. IS SINGH LBW? Rashid likes it, the umpire doesn’t. England go upstairs. 31st over: Ireland 104-6 (Campher 11, Singh 4) Moeen slows it straight back down, singles down the ground to bookend the other with four dots sandwiched in. 30th over: Ireland 102-6 (Campher 10, Singh 3) That helps! Rashid, from nowhere has a shocker, sending down a wide then a no-ball that runs away for four. After the scrappy start, he gets to the other end of the over giving up nine. He has two left.“Hey Adam, how’s it going?” I’m well, JP. Thanks for asking. “You’ve had some pretty tough to things to say about the Southampton Bowl in the recent past, and I just wondered if you’re warming to the place? Sure, it doesn’t have the venerable hauntology or history of other grounds but it does have some of the best sunset skieslong shadows combos in cricket. I love the place.”It’s true, I’ve been nasty about this place in the past and I reserve the right to be so again in the future. But credit to the team here, who have done a wonderful job turning the ground (and broader venue) into a biosecure hub. Without it, it’s tough to see how internaitonal cricket could have worked this year. Well played.29th over: Ireland 92-6 (Campher 8, Singh 2) Would it surprise you to learn that Morgan has thrown the ball to Moeen who skips through an over in 75 seconds, giving away just a single? No, not me, either. So, so many dot balls. 28th over: Ireland 92-6 (Campher 8, Singh 1) Simi Singh defends a couple before coming forward to Rashid, taking one down the ground to get off the mark. The leggie isn’t far away with that googly again, Campher playing it away awkwardly. 319 are his figures from seven overs so far. Has it on a string. Not a pretty, Tucker responding to so many Rashid dot balls by trying to slog a wide legbreak but only managing to top edge it to Topley around the corner. Easy peasy. 27th over: Ireland 91-5 (Tucker 21, Campher 8) Shot. Campher, my man (I’ve interviewed him three times this week!) strokes Mahmood through point for four. But the problem is rotation for Ireland: this is the only scoring shot from the over. 26th over: Ireland 87-5 (Tucker 21, Campher 4) Rashid again. Campher is off strike first ball out to cover easily enough, but Tucker is no match for the veteran’s variety, unable to get any of the next five deliveries away. He has 218 from six. 25th over: Ireland 86-5 (Tucker 21, Campher 3) Ireland are halfway through, going at just over three an over. And Tucker is fortunate not to become the sixth wicket to fall, his outside edge off Mahmood just wide of the ‘keeper Bairstow. “I came to this a little late after watching the qualifying at Silverstone (cricket take note about free to air sport),” writes Stephen Brown, “but when did England’s ODI squad get so weak that we need to bring James Vince in as a first change bowler? Did I dream that we won the world cup only last year?”I wouldn’t quite see it that way. Rather, Morgan saw a chance to take advantage of a skittish Irish batting line-up by throwing something at them that they couldn’t have prepared for. And, to be fair, it worked out pretty well. 24th over: Ireland 80-5 (Tucker 16, Campher 2) Oooh, inches from two in two for Rashid! His wrong’un to the new man Campher goes through the gate via the inside edge and so close to the leg stump. They come back for a couple. Superb wrist spin.“Can’t understand why the Irish batsmen are struggling to read the Rashid wrong ‘un,” declares Brian Withington. “Viewed in super slow mo from behind the bowler it’s clearly obvious when it comes out of the back of the hand. Simple game.” Viewed in super slow motion, Shoaib Akhtar wasn’t difficult to handle, either. One of those wrong’uns from before, to Kev O’Brien:Oh dear, he’s done all the hard work Tector, but that had a sense of inevitability with Rashid on - he’s battled to pick him throughout. It ends with a chip to mid-on.23rd over: Ireland 77-4 (Tector 28, Tucker 15) Well pulled by Tucker, waiting in the crease to take advantage of a shorter slower ball from Saqib, helping it to the rope. Nothing else going on here but these two have put on 33 in 43 balls. It’s a start. “Hi Adam.” G’day, Pete Salmon. “My daughter’s first solid food was spinach, and the result inspired a family song to the tune of Spanish Flea. It was a little spinach pooand it was yellow, green and blueOk we lied about the blueBut it was all full of spinach and when it was finished we knewit was a little spinach poo.’ The great thing is she’s 16 now and we can still sing it to her at key moments.” Glorious Girl Dad areas - love it. 22nd over: Ireland 71-4 (Tector 27, Tucker 10) A quick survey of the press box regarding my comment about Rashid in the previous over and expectation is that yes, he will still be going in three years time when England defend their title. It would take Mason Crane or Matt Parkinson to overtake him, and they’re not close to doing so yet. Another accurate and probing over, just one off it. Too good.21st over: Ireland 70-4 (Tector 26, Tucker 10) Saqib Mahmood on for his first go today, shuffled back to the middle overs after opening up with the new ball on Thursday. Just where he needs to be to begin, three singles and nothing more.“Hello Adam.” Hello, Geoff Wignall! “I’d just like to say that I hope it’ll be many a long year before it’s your daughter’s turn to be feeding you mashed up banana.”I really hope she goes full Pete Siddle and eats seven (seven!) each morning. 20th over: Ireland 67-4 (Tector 24, Tucker 9) Rashid is bouncing through his greatest hits: legbreak to slower wrong’un to quicker topspinner. At 32, he’s only getting better. If his shoulder stays together, he can make the 2023 World Cup.“Your comment that Harry Tector had two brothers piqued my interest,” writes Robert Darby. “Sad to say they are Tim and Jack, and not Hannibal.” If the latter, they would get an invite to Shane Warne’s barbeque mural. On that, read Jonathan Liew’s piece. Trust me on this one. It’s his finest work. Just do it. 19th over: Ireland 63-4 (Tector 23, Tucker 6) Vince is getting a touch ahead of himself here, having a go at a slower ball that drifts well down ther legside. Before that, Tucker was down the track at him, clearing mid-on for three. They can’t let this go on much longer, can they? He has a pop at another slower one later in the set, Tector able to smash him high and handsome over his head for four more. With that, I suspect the Vince experiment - fun and effective as it was - will end.“There is a cricketing connection to the vexed gelatine question (over 3),” insists Rob Lewis. “Put on agar agar instead of gelatine, as in Ashton Agar, the spinner.”18th over: Ireland 52-4 (Tector 17, Tucker 2) Tector has a crack at a full toss and smashes it straight back at Rashid, nearly taking the umpire out! Gee, that wasn’t far away at all from hitting his head. How far are we away from umpires wearing helmets in all white-ball games? It’s pretty much standard practice in the BBL. Anyway, that went for four. Later in the over, Rashid fancied a leg-before shout against the same batsman but the umpire turned him down. Quite forgiving. “I watched Haseed Hameed on the Trent Bridge webstream this morning,” reports John Starnuck. “He took ages to get off the mark and missed a fair few, but stuck at it. I noticed he also scraped two marks at each end, presumably for off and middle stumps. Is this a thing?”I’m mostly interested in hearing that he scrapped out of a tough start. More, please.17th over: Ireland 45-4 (Tector 13, Tucker 0) This really is Generation Next in the middle now, Tector and Tucker picked for these ODIs ahead of Porterfield and Wilson, two mainstays from the golden generation in the squad but overlooked for the XI. Tector plays Vince carefully, which stands to reason after what happened to his captain, happy wih one to cover. Oooh, Tucker is beaten second up outside the off-stump by the medium pace. Vince’s figures? 18 from three. What a world.“I for one am very excited to see how Vince manages to get out caught behind while bowling,” says Luke Stevenson. I’ve not been on twitter during his spell, but I’m looking forward to reading many jokes along these lines when I return! Drinks on the field at the fall of O’Brien’s wicket. “Hello Adam,” Hi, Ian Forth. “It’s a magical time with your daughter and I do hope your mother-in-law continues to deliver the goods. Meanwhile on commentary, I’m not sure KP really understands how it works. In the space of one over he’s blatantly contradicted his co-commentator (“Was it a beauty though? Was it?”) which surely breaks an unwritten protocol rambled and chuckled his way through an incomprehensible incident from the 18th green of his round of golf yesterday and finished by descending into ancient bitternesses. Mark Butcher tries to wind it up with “Life’s too short to hold grudges”, but KP evidently disagrees - ‘Not if it costs you your career, Butch.’”The TV commentators are locked away all week here, too, only able to socialise with each other after hours. That must be... so much fun. What a beauty! Adil Rashid is into the attack and into the book with a wrong’un that sneaks through the smallest of gaps between O’Brien’s bat and pad. Class. 15th over: Ireland 41-3 (Tector 10, O’Brien 2) Kevin O’Brien, the Irish champion, pulls a couple away to get off the mark and end Vince’s successful over. Yes, you’re reading that correctly. Dare I say it, Ricky Ponting energy dismissing the skipper.Oh no. The Irish skipper shapes up to cut a short delivery from Vince and pulls out of the shot but not quickly enough, somehow finding a way to edge through to Bairstow. That’s James Vince with an international wicket, if you don’t mind! 14th over: Ireland 38-2 (Balbirnie 15, Tector 9) Tector is clearly battling against some nerves here, his footwork tentative and allowing Moeen to dot him up too easily. He’s a fine player, likely to be the first of three brothers to end up in this team. Good judges say their sister, Alice, could be the best of the lot. 13th over: Ireland 35-2 (Balbirnie 14, Tector 7) Here we go... James Vince into the attack to replace David Willey! He’s never bowled in ODIs, four times getting a single over in Test Matches. He does have a First Class 5-for... against the Loughborough students in 2013. Gosh, I love cricket. His medium pace is just that, dropping them down there at 75mph or so. But, he’s through it giving up just three singles, Balbirnie even leaving one alone just outside the off-stump. Fair play. 12th over: Ireland 32-2 (Balbirnie 14, Tector 4) Spin for the first time, Moeen to Tector, who eventually rotates the strike to point. Balnirnie, a fine player of slow bowling, sweeps hard and well, skipping to the square leg rope for four. Better.11th over: Ireland 27-2 (Balbirnie 10, Tector 3) Willey goes again with the field still up, just third man and fine leg back. Balbirnie backs his drive when giving something to free his arms at, making solid contact down the ground for his first boundary. Singles for each player off the front foot later in the over, suggesting there isn’t quite as much swing as there was a couple of overs ago. Seven from it.Good news for Haseeb Hameed fans - i.e. every single one of us. 10th over: Ireland 20-2 (Balbirnie 5, Tector 2) Topley is bowling with real control and confidence here, banging away just short of a good length at Balbirnie, his height making it so hard to score off him without risk. When the captain gets something to drive he picks out Moeen at cover, who completes an excellent ing stop. Just one from the over, making Ireland 202 at the end of the powerplay. Eek. “Reece Topley looks cool,” begins Tom V d Gucht. “With his stubble, tats and sweatband, he’s quite possibly the coolest sportsman I’ve seen in years. He doesn’t look like he belongs on the cricket pitch unless it was in some sort of Frat-pack comedy - like the Chaz Michael Michaels character from Blades of Glory.” Isolation treats some haircuts better than others and Topley is very much a winner. 9th over: Ireland 19-2 (Balbirnie 4, Tector 2) Ohh, another gem from Willey, pitching outside off before carving Balbirnie in half. So close to a third. Getting off strike, it’s Tector’s turn and he’s beaten on the other edge. He has 27 from five.“Don’t want to talk him up too much, but this Willey guy looks top-class,” writes Abhijato Sensarma. “I suspect he’ll be in a world tournament squad soon enough, the bloke’s got all the tricks in his bag! Oh wait...”There was no good solution. Obviously, England had to pick Archer and were proven correct. Willey’s omission was the only credible solution, sad as that all was. The good news? He’s 30 and there are a lot of white-ball World Cups coming up. 8th over: Ireland 18-2 (Balbirnie 3, Tector 2) Topley through another useful over, keeping Balbirnie quiet for the most part then beating Tector outside the off-stump. Ireland are in a real hole here. They need their captain to dig them out. “Afternoon Adam, hope all’s good with you.” Thanks, Thomas Hopkins - likewise. “I noticed you sort of skipped over the banana ice cream, no comment on its quality, should we be reading anything in to that?” Oh, it was outstanding. Chocolate pieces popped in there, some caramel topping, the works. I’m well looked after. “Also, if we’re after easy puddings, can I throw in Chocolate Fudge Tart? Caramelised condensed milk, chocolate, double cream, melt it all together, slap it on a biscuit (I go Hobnob) base and then in the fridge. If anything, it’s even more aggressively sweet than it sounds.” Spent lockdown well, didn’t you? 7th over: Ireland 17-2 (Balbirnie 2, Tector 2) Harry Tector, the 20-year-old in his second ODI, in to face Willey in full flight. He chopped on for nothing on debut, part of the carnage. Ooh, he’s lucky not to be off for another duck, nervously driving and missing at Willey’s straight one. A lot of faith is being invested in the young man, Ireland’s most consistent T20 player against Afghanistan before Covid. And he’s off the mark, tucking the final ball of the successful over for a couple. Good lad.Top snaffle! Banton at backward point ing to his left, pulling down the catch at pace. A sliced drive brings an end to Stirling’s day, Willey into the book again. 6th over: Ireland 15-1 (Stirling 12, Balbirnie 2) Wheels from Topley, beating Balbirnie with an 88mph beaut. Lots to work with here for England. Good selection. “Apologies to David Wall about the cheesecake,” begins John Starbuck, “but we don’t appreciate the cooked versions. You could still go ahead and send in the recipe though. Also, how are readers on making their own Bakewell Puddings?”I have very little to add, but I’m very happy to facilitate this conversation.5th over: Ireland 13-1 (Stirling 11, Balbirnie 1) The captain Balbirnie is off the mark first ball, pushing one to mid-off. I saw the other night on twitter that these two made something like 40 per cent of Ireland’s runs in ODI cricket over the last couple of years - something ridiculous like that. They have to do the heavy lifting here against some excellent swing and seam from Willey - what a return he’s having.“Hei Adam.” Brendan Large in Norway, good afternoon to you. “Just a little tip from a father of four...don’t be too excited about the grown-upfood. It means stuff coming out the other end is more like a grown-up’s too.”Five and a half months now, a very fun age. Does no wrong. I’m ready for it. The end of a painful stay, Delany trapped for a 12-ball duck. Willey gets him with his inswinger, the opener missing when trying to clip across the line. No DRS there.4th over: Ireland 11-0 (Stirling 10, Delany 0) Much better length from Topley, not allowing Delany to get into his preferred front foot to drive, as he did quite nicely (albeit briefly) on Thursday before the wickets tumbled. Back to back maidens. Delany has faced 11 balls without scoring. You don’t see that too often these days.Ben Jones via CricViz has the answer on southpaw openers, and it’s a good’un.3rd over: Ireland 11-0 (Stirling 10, Delany 0) Willey is all over Stirling here, finding his inside edge, hitting him on the thigh pad then yorking him. But the experienced opener hollds his nerve, carefully leaving and defending the rest. A maiden. “Hi Adam.” Hi, David Wall. “I’m a bit in two minds about today’s match in light of events on Thursday. On one hand it’s good to have more cricket, and hopefully David Wiley will build on his triumphant return to the team. On the other, John Starbuck’s mango cheesecake recipe in the OBO was such a disappointment after the initial description sounded so promising. No eggs and not baked...you’re effectively spreading cream cheese on a biscuit. And gelatine. Why, why, why? Just mix some eggs in with the cream cheese, shove it in the oven at about 160C for 45-50 minutes, then turn the oven off and leave it to cool in there with the oven door closed before chilling in the fridge.”So I missed a fair bit, then! My girlfriend’s mum made us homemade banana ice cream for pudding last night. Oh! This is far more relevant: my baby girl had a piece of mushed up banana before I drove in today... her first solid food. It begins. 2nd over: Ireland 11-0 (Stirling 10, Delany 0) Here comes Reece Topley from the Pavilion End, two left-armers opening for England for the first time since... well, ever? He’s too full to begin, driven strongly by Stirling down the ground for the first boundary of the day. He makes it a second four when timing a drive through extra cover for another. Lovely batting. Ooh, that’s better, beating Delany with pace.“Afternoon Adam.” And to you, Brian Withington. “How’s life in the Ageas Bowl bio-bubble? Is it (a) an immersive escapist experience for our man on the inside or (b) a wrench to be apart from the little ‘un (c) an opportunity to recover from sleep deprivation (see b)?”Truth told, being in the ‘outer bubble’ means we get to go home at night, so it’s no big deal. It’s a strict process getting into the ground with a number of tests leading up to the ODIs and checks at the ground each time you enter, but no complaints! 1st over: Ireland 2-0 (Stirling 1, Delany 0) Willey sprays one down the legside to begin, opening Ireland’s account. He’s on it second ball though, swinging back towards Stirling and finding his inside edge. Oooh, a beaut to follow, beating him on the outside edge. Swinging in then angling away - that’s classy bowling early on. The experienced right-hander is off the mark with one to square leg. Delany has a look to begin, defending the last couple with that idiosyncratic backlift. The players are on the field! David Willey, England’s power play supremo, has the new ball from the Hotel End. Paul Stirling, who was out to him in the first over on Thursday, is set to face up to begin. He’s out there with Gareth Delany. The players and squads take a knee once in position, as they did in the series opener. PLAY! I can’t explain this I can’t see any rain. But it’s on. Delayed start likely. “Good afternoon Adam.” Steve Morgan in North Devon, good afternoon to you. “I was hoping that you, together with the OBO massive, would be able to help settle an argument: Following the great Sam Billings innings on Thursday, is it premature to be referring to the scandal of his regular omission from the side as ‘Billingsgate’” I’ll promise you this: next time he’s rotated out, that will be the intro of my article. “Great to have cricket on,” writes Toby Sims. Couldn’t agree with you more. “Thoroughly enjoyed the series against the West Indies, and enjoying this so far, especially with some ‘new faces’. Very happy to see Sam Billings back at it, and it would bring a smile to my face to see Topley in the mix again. Hope to see Ireland’s young ‘uns crack at it too.”I spoke to Billing yesterday - he’s in very good nick. As noted by a couple of my colleagues, it was quite the sliding doors moment for him on Thursday when his county teammate, Joe Denly, pulled out with a bad back. If not for that, Billings would have been running drinks. Now, it looks like he’s earned a sustained go. Reece Topley’s last ODI was February 2016. He was 21 then tall and quick. On the basis of that form, he made the World T20 squad, playing in the tournament. Then, it all went horribly wrong. As is the case for some many fast bowlers, his back let him down over and over again. Many operations and two counties later, he’s back. My press box colleague Rob Johnston wrote a great long piece with Reece last year. McCarthy out injured, Josh little into the XI. The left-arm seamer picked up four wickets on one-day international debut against England in Dublin last May. Morgan says he “wasn’t really bothered” either way about the toss. You’ve gotta love him. And Reece Topley is in for Tom Curran. Nice story! It’s lovely here now. Maybe some rain later on, but fine for the time being. As we build up to the toss, have a look at Barney’s column on Stokes saturation. Welcome to the second ODI between England and Ireland and welcome to the bio-bubble at Southampton where I’m coming to you from this afternoon. It’s a sticky and almost steamy, plenty of cloud cover and I’m afraid to say there has been some rain about. However, the sun is now shining ahead of the toss in about 20 minutes.The hosts easily accounted for Andy Balbirnie’s men in the opener, winning by six wickets with 22 overs remaining. The damage was done early, recuding Ireland to 285 after sending them in. After that frenetic start, debutant Curtis Campher (a great story, which I’ll tell you more about as we go) settled in to bat through for an unbeaten 59, getting the visitors to 174. It wasn’t the most convincing chase early, but Sam Billings (67 not out) and Eoin Morgan took care of business. In terms of selection, the main point of discussion is the fact that they are playing on the same surface as two days ago. It was slow then, taking to turn, so it should jag today. On that basis, Ireland have brought left-arm tweaker George Dockrell into their squad, seamer Barry McCarthy ruled out with a knee injury. For England, Liam Livingstone makes the 14 at the expense of Joe Denly, who has a bad back. Watching warm-ups in front of me, I wouldn’t be surprised, though, if Reece Topley is brought in for his first international since 2016. The left-armer had has more operations on his back than hot meals over the last few years - this is quite the comeback tale. Maybe in for Tom Curran? Rotation, rotation, rotation.

ByteDance’s concession will test whether Trump’s threat to ban TikTok is a negotiating tactic or whether he is intent on cracking down on a social media app that has up to 80 million daily active users in the US.ByteDance was previously seeking to keep a minority stake in the US business of TikTok, which the White House had rejected. Under the new proposed deal, ByteDance would exit completely and Microsoft would take over TikTok in the United States, the sources said. Some ByteDance investors that are based in the United States may be given the opportunity to take minority stakes in the business, the sources added.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Trump would accept ByteDance’s concession. ByteDance in Beijing did not respond to a request for comment.Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.The White House declined to comment on whether Trump would accept ByteDance’s concession. ByteDance in Beijing did not respond to a request for comment.Under ByteDance’s new proposal, Microsoft would be in charge of protecting all US user data, the sources said. The plan allows for another US company other than Microsoft to take over TikTok in the United States, the sources added.As relations between the United States and China deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong’s autonomy, cyber security and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint in the dispute between the world’s two largest economies.ByteDance has been considering a range of options for TikTok amid US pressure to relinquish control of the app, which allows users to create short videos with special effects and has become wildly popular with US teenagers.ByteDance acquired the Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly in a $1bn deal in 2017 and relaunched it as TikTok the following year. ByteDance did not seek approval for the acquisition from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for potential national security risks.Reuters reported last year that CFIUS had opened an investigation into TikTok.The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves US military or intelligence personnel. Ordering the estment of TikTok would not be the first time the White House has taken action over such concerns."},{"url":null,"title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

The writer of a new book, Lost Lanes Northern England, chooses his favouritesFrom the city of York to the highest village in East Yorkshire’s big sky countryStart and finish York Distance 57 milesTotal ascent 553 metres Terrain Mostly lanes and asphalt cycleway, one short off-road trackBike shophire Cycle Heaven, YorkFull route details and mapThe rolling hills – wolds – of East Yorkshire are the only chalk landscapes in northern England. Mile upon mile of smooth, green whaleback hills and dry river valleys are dotted with village greens and duck ponds. There are plenty of quiet lanes and byways, which makes it perfect for cycling.The Yorkshire Wolds see far fewer visitors than the Lakes, Dales or North York Moors, but nobody has done more to raise their profile than David Hockney. In the early 2000s, Hockney returned to East Yorkshire from Los Angeles and made his home in Bridlington. For the next few years he drew, painted, photographed and filmed the lanes, fields, trees and hedgerows of the wolds and brought a secret corner of the English countryside to a global audience. The various wolds locations he painted are shown at yocc. Fans will want to visit the location of his Three Trees Near Thixendale: the trees are two miles east of the village in William Dale, on the road that leads north to the abandoned medieval village of Wharram Percy. It is well worth the detour, but choices have to be made, and my route turns south into Thixendale, towards Huggate.The farming system of the wolds is topsy-turvy, with sheep and cattle grazing the valley floors while the uplands are ploughed for arable crops. Just like on the downs of southern England, get up high to experience the wolds at their wildest and most energising.Huggate is the highest village in the wolds, so all roads from here are downhill. The descent from Huggate to Pocklington is another great cycling road, along a dry river valley past the picture-postcard village of Millington. Pocklington is a small, handsome market town, and marks the transition from the wolds to the flat Vale of York.From Pocklington the route picks a way through big arable fields – look out for drifts of poppies –\u0026nbsptaking in a very lost lane past the remains of North Selby mine. Developed in the 1980s and 90s, Selby was the last hurrah of the British coal industry, with five mines sunk over 20 square miles and linked underground. From just south of Naburn the final miles back to York are largely traffic-free, along York’s Solar System cycleway (formerly a section of the East Coast main line), past the racecourse and into the city along the River Ouse.A short route in the Upper Calder Valley taking in the Pennine watershed and the stark landscape of Blackstone EdgeStart and finish Hebden BridgeDistance 24 miles Total ascent 471 metres Terrain Towpath, roads, lanes and a short section of good gravel trackBike shop (no bike hire) Blazing Saddles, Hebden BridgeFull route details and mapSomehow, and nobody knows exactly how, Hebden Bridge went from listless mill town in the late 1960s to become the arty, free-thinking, LGBTQ-friendly, tech-savvy, hipster capital of the South Pennines. The ride begins here and heads west on the Rochdale Canal towards Todmorden.There’s a cheerful local rivalry between these two groovy little former mill towns. “Tod” has a strong claim to be the most green-fingered town in the UK. Its Incredible Edible urban gardening project has seen little plots of land all around the town turned over to growing fruit, vegetables, herbs and bee-friendly flowers. All the produce is free for all to pick and enjoy. This model of urban gardening has been emulated in dozens of other towns and cities up and down the country. All around town “KINDNESS” is spelled out in bold white letters.The canal was opened in 1804 as the main highway between Yorkshire and Lancashire. The Pennine watershed is marked by a cast-iron bench and a poem by the poet Andrew McMillan. At Littleborough, the route leaves the canal and heads uphill on what is undoubtedly an ancient way across the Pennines. Cutting tools made from flint, a stone not found in West Yorkshire, have been discovered here and dated to 10,000 years ago. Daniel Defoe came this way on his tours of the north: he nearly came to grief in an August snowstorm and described Blackstone Edge as “the Andes of England”.At the top of Blackstone Edge is a brief detour on a track along the top of the escarpment beside the reservoir. The glass and steel towers of Manchester shimmer down below, and on a clear day the mountains of north Wales are visible. The bare hills, the pylons leading off into the distance, the cold, dark reservoirs with their windblown wavelets, wind-hewn rocks and abandoned quarry workings make it a perfect – and popular – location for a moody album cover or fashion shoot.Visible from the track is a slab of weather-sculpted millstone grit the size of a house. On it is carved a poem by Simon Armitage entitled Rain – an appropriate choice of subject for these parts. The route turns right at the second of a series of reservoirs, but carry straight on for 2½ miles on an increasingly uneven track to eventually reach Gaddings Dam. It has as small patch of golden sand that made national newspaper headlines as England’s highest beach, accompanied by the inevitable photos of bikini-clad sun worshippers soaking up the rays. It’s worth the extra five-mile detour, time and energy permitting.The reservoirs were built to supply water to operate the locks and feed the Rochdale canal below, and gravity is also on hand to take you back to the Calder Valley. The Blackstone Edge road (B6138) is said to be the longest continuous descent in England: five miles long, with a drop of almost 300 metres. Though the longest descent in England has an obvious appeal to the freewheeling cyclist, more rewarding in terms of views and quiet lanes is the route via Sykes Gate, Holly Hall Lane and Long Causeway, and the one I prefer. Both bring you into the Calder valley at Mytholmroyd, from where cycle route NCR 68 follows the river back to Hebden Bridge.Big views and tough climbs among the magnificent limestone rock formations of the Yorkshire DalesStart and finish SettleDistance 39 milesTotal ascent 968 metresTerrain Mostly lanes and one short section of rough stuff\u0026nbspBike shophire 3 Peaks Cycles, SettleFull route details and mapThe Rough-Stuff Fellowship is the oldest off-road cycling club in the world. It was founded in 1955, long before northern Californians in plaid shirts took their clunkers on the dirt tracks of Marin County and invented mountain biking. Rough-Stuff members sought out the green lanes, drovers’ roads and mountain tracks of the British Isles and further afield. This ride takes in a short section of Mastiles Lane, a classic route that, long before it was discovered by cyclists on steel bikes with canvas saddlebags, woollen socks and brass Primus stoves, was used by the Romans and later became an important medieval trade route across the dales.Heading east out of Settle, the route goes straight uphill, as is often the way in the dales. There’s a good excuse to take a break in the form of Scaleber Force, a waterfall in dense woodland a short walk from the road. Further up the hill are big views south across Ribblesdale into Lancashire. The dark, glowering form of Pendle Hill is visible in the distance.Dramatic limestone is the defining feature of the next section, through Malham and passing some of the most remarkable geology of the dales. The two highlights are Janet’s Foss, a small but enchanting waterfall and swimmable plunge pool about a mile beyond Malham (the footpath is clearly signed), and Gordale Scar, a little further on. Geologists are unsure how Gordale Scar – a huge wall of limestone, like the crumbling ruins of a giant’s fortress – was formed, though some believe it’s the collapsed remains of a cave system from an earlier ice age.The road continues uphill, getting ever steeper until the landscape opens up into the broad moorland tops. Here you’ll feel quite alone as you venture on to the unsurfaced track and join Mastiles Lane. If you are prepared for some more rough stuff, follow the track east to Kilnsey and trim a few miles from the route. But an easier ride, and equally scenic, is the asphalt lane to the south-west, towards Threshfield and on into Grassington. Here, in the valley of the River Wharfe, you’ll swap the wild solitude of Mastiles Lane for the a pretty dales village that’s often thronged with day trippers. The Grassington Folk Museum (free) is worth a visit and there are some good swimming spots on the river, both upstream and downstream of the village.\u0026nbspFrom Grassington, the route continues north, beneath the overhanging limestone cliffs of Kilnsey Crag and forking left into Littondale, a U-shaped glacial valley – and the road is a gem to ride. Just off it is Arncliffe, an archetypal Dales village used to film the first seasons of Emmerdale Farm in the early 1970s.\u0026nbspAt the head of the valley the road takes a sharp turn before climbing through stone-walled fields on to the open moor. At the top there’s a grand view of Pen-y-ghent, the smallest but most mountain-like of Yorkshire’s Three Peaks (the other two are Ingleborough and Whernside). All three are isolated remnants of an entire layer of millstone grit that once lay on top of the older carboniferous limestone.Once back in the valley, there’s a few miles of quiet lane from Stainforth into Settle. It passes one final five-star swimming spot at Stainforth Force, perfect for an end-of-ride dip.An intimate journey into the heart of the Lake District, taking in some of its best-loved lakes and tarnsStart and finish Ambleside Distance 33 milesTotal ascent 890 metresTerrain Mostly lanes, a few sections of good gravel track\u0026nbspBike shophire Ghyllside Cycles, AmblesideFull route details and mapFor the steady stream of Romantic poets and their admirers who made the journey to Dove Cottage, the damp, cramped home where William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy spent eight years of “plain living, but high thinking”, the road from Ambleside to Grasmere was the finishing straight of a journey that would have taken several days. The likes of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas De Quincey would have walked it, but today’s A591 is so busy that it’s fit for neither walking nor cycling.\u0026nbspFrom Little Langdale, a bridleway leads through the woods towards Coniston. It’s worth stopping just after the ford to take a look at Cathedral Cave, a spectacular chamber inside an old slate quarry. Leave bikes at the bottom of the path but take a light in case you want to venture deeper.After rejoining the road in High Tilberthwaite, look out for Touchstone Fold, a slate sheep pen made by the artist Andy Goldsworthy. This is one of 46 sheepfold installations he and his team have built in Cumbria.Coniston sits at the head of Coniston Water with the sun in the south, it is a five-mile sheet of shimmering silver. Two names stand out in the history of Coniston: John Ruskin and Donald Campbell. Ruskin loved the beauty of the Lakes and spent the last three decades of his life at Brantwood, a waterside house two miles south of the village. Campbell was more into speed than scenery. He set world speed records on the water here, and died in a crash while attempting to top 300mph in 1967. His body and his jet-powered Bluebird K7 lay on the lakebed until ers recovered them in 2001. Both men are buried in Coniston churchyard. The small museum in the village contains lots of Ruskin ephemera and salvaged pieces of Campbell’s Bluebird.\u0026nbspThere are more good swimming spots just beyond the village at the head of the lake.Start Alnmouth Finish Berwick-upon-Tweed (return by train)Distance 57 miles Total ascent 550 metres Terrain Lanes and a few off-road sections which can be muddy when wet. ModerateBike shophire The Bike Shop, AlnwickFull route details and mapA linear route taking in the ancient castles, huge beaches and tiny harbours of the Northumberland coastAlnmouth to Berwick-upon-Tweed is the wildest and most scenic section of the Northumberland coast, and easily rideable in a day with a train return. A long weekend allows for detours, a proper look around the ruined castles, a dip in the sea or even a boat trip to the Farne Islands.Alnmouth grew up as a port with a fishing fleet, shipyards and a trade exporting grain and other produce. Shifting sands and the coming of the railwayschanged that, though the trains also brought holidaymakers and the village grew into a small seaside resort, which retains its well-heeled charm.Head north on the coast road towards the old smugglers’ haven at Boulmer. Beyond Boulmer is a lovely two-mile section on good gravel tracks via a pair of tiny sandy coves. Road cyclists with skinny tyres may prefer the road via Longhoughton and the wooded parkland of Howick Hall, the country seat of the Earls Grey.Unlike the ruins of Dunstanburgh, the castle at Bamburgh is very much intact. Its stout form, built atop a natural outcrop of volcanic rock, commands the channel between the mainland and the Farne Islands. Few places in Britain are quite so steeped in history. The present castle is of Norman design but before that it was the seat of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Northumbria. They had seized it in 547AD from the Gododdin, the Celtic people of the Yr Hen Ogledd (the Old North) who knew the fort as Din Guarie. During the Wars of the Roses, the castle was a Lancastrian stronghold, and when Yorkist forces besieged it in 1464 it was the first time an English castle succumbed to gunpowder artillery.North of Bamburgh there’s a nice rough-stuff option along the coast road via Blackrocks Point lighthouse, and from the sandy expanse of Budle Bay the route heads inland until it reaches the causeway to Lindisfarne. The causeway is under water for several hours around high tide – it’s well worth venturing across if the tides are favourable but be sure to check the times.The island was the base for the Celtic monks who converted northern England to Christianity and who produced the dazzling Lindisfarne Gospels, which are now in the British Library. The island is mostly car-free anda pleasure to explore, from the castle, ruined abbey and harbour to a perfect swimming beach at Cove’s Haven on the north coast.Beyond Lindisfarne it’s mostly salt marshes and dunes over a range of surfaces, from tarmac to hard-packed gravel, before a final section along the cliffs that can be hard going when it’s wet. Berwick-upon-Tweed has its very own border-town vibe, and there are some good pubs in which to while away the time before the train back to Alnmouth.Lost Lanes Northern England: 36 Glorious Bike Rides in Yorkshire, Lake District, Northumberland, Pennines and Northern England by Jack Thurston is published by Wild Things, £16.99, wildthingspublishing This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

We have seen this occur across the globe as countries begin to see demand slowly returning to the hospitality sector,” said the STR director Thomas Emanuel, adding that it would take “multiple years” for urban demand to return to 2019 levels.While many had reopened, city hotels were still struggling as numerous nearby attractions and events venues remained closed, said Jane Pendlebury, chair of the Hospitality Professionals Association. And fears of travelling on public transport still loomed large.“We’ve seen coastal hotels and those in traditionally popular destinations, such as the Lake District, enjoy a bumper few weeks as UK-based travellers look to escape post-lockdown,” she said. “The picture has been far from rosy for other operators.”“Outdoor holidays have exploded in popularity this year, with one booked every three seconds on our website,” said Pitchup’s founder Dan Yates, pointing out that a popup campsite in the Lake District that went live last week took over 600 bookings within days. “In the words of the deputy chief medical officer, it’s a ‘biological truism’ that outdoor environments are safer than those indoors.”Demand on campsites is running at treble the normal levels and availability is extremely limited for week-long breaks next month in Devon, Cornwall and other popular counties. Bookings are also treble that of the same time last year on the Cool Camping website, and sales of camper vans have also reportedly risen significantly.“I always think that the best memories are created doing something new,” said the campsites founder Martin Smith. “With around 100 counties in the UK – and each one offering something a little bit different to the last – you can travel and still avoid the crowds this summer. Wherever you go, a few nights under the stars is good for the soul.”The growing popularity of camping seems unlikely to abate after 41 flights to Spain from Stansted, East Midlands and Manchester airports alone were cancelled between Sunday and Wednesday.The package holiday provider Travel Republic confirmed it was forced to cancel several thousand bookings over the next two weeks. All Tui holidays have been cancelled until 17 August for mainland Spain and until 10 August for the Balearics and Canaries.“We’re now doing everything we can to support those affected,” a Travel Republic spokesperson said. Jet2, which has asked some holidaymakers on Spain’s islands to cut short their breaks, did not respond to requests for comment.The Visit Yorkshire chief executive, James Mason, said people were discovering a “new-found appreciation of what’s on their doorsteps” after months of lockdown, as he praised his county’s ersity and beauty.“In our pretty market towns we have some of the best seafood in the country, then travel inland and you could be in the wilderness of one of our three national parks.”Fran Tham, 76, from just outside Cardiff, will have her first caravanning holiday this summer in three decades. “We’re not caravan people but I’m excited to see the family and have a barbecue,” she said of her plan to see her daughter in her new caravan in Suffolk.“It’s a low-key holiday but it feels like a big step as we are in our 70s and have been very careful in lockdown. We would have gone to Tenerife to stay with friends but we don’t want to fly now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b62a2d2db2c5f2d61b9f64c4cc224d1969b8396e/0_0_5942_3567/master/5942.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b2138a55385c78586cf4dbd7c91ddde2","title":"texas business open coronavirus cases surge","story":"Four months into the pandemic a mandatory mask order is in place in the state, but some worry it’s too little, too lateAn older man in an orange apron greets customers at the Home Depot in College Station, Texas.

In June, he said that Texas was “wide open for business”. Now in late July, more than four months into the Covid-19 pandemic, a mandatory mask order is in place across the state – a reversal from Abbott’s initial position that the government should not infringe on personal rights by telling citizens what to do.But, with little enforcement except by some businesses, some worry Abbott’s reversals are too little, too late. As hospitals struggle and cases mount, much of ordinary life in Texas still appears to continue as normal. Texas has recently been reporting record single-day death tolls. Since the recording of data begun on 4 March, there had been 5,877 Covid-related deaths in the state as of 28 July.Despite these numbers, many businesses in Texas remain fully operational. Meanwhile masks, which health experts recommend to prevent the transmission of the highly contagious virus, have become a symbol of America’s bitter political ide, with many Texas Republican officials shunning them after Donald Trump long refused to wear one in public.On Wednesday, the Texas congressman Louie Gohmert, who steadfastly refused to wear a mask during much of the coronavirus pandemic, said he had tested positive for Covid-19 and would self-quarantine for 10 days.“It’s really ironic, because a lot of people have made a big deal out of my not wearing a mask a lot,” Gohmert said in an interview with KETK-TV. “But in the last week or two, I have worn a mask more than I have in the whole last four months.”Abbott’s lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, was also often at odds with the governor on masks, and recently criticized the advice of one of the US’s top public health experts, Dr Anthony Fauci. In an interview in March, Patrick said he would rather die than see the economy destroyed for his grandchildren.“Let’s get back to work. Let’s get back to living,” he said. “Let’s be smart about it, and those of us who are 70-plus, we’ll take care of ourselves, but don’t sacrifice the country.”Before Abbott announced the statewide mask order, Diana Robles said she didn’t think the pandemic was being taken seriously in Texas. Robles, a recent high school graduate and an essential worker at a grocery store in Houston, has been working upwards of 40-plus hours a week.“Since the pandemic, we’ve gotten busier. Our orders have quadrupled,” Robles said.“Once the mask law was implemented, I saw a difference. We can now refuse service to those who don’t wear a mask,” Robles said. “What scares me the most was that I could be doing everything right but I didn’t know if other people were. Something could have been done way sooner to prevent this.”Robles has been tasked with limiting rolls of paper towels and toilet paper rolls as well as de-escalating tense situations with customers. She recounted some experiences dealing with difficult customers.“I witnessed a lady that wanted to return a ham. We told her we weren’t accepting returns during Covid. My manager is from Venezuela and has a bit of an accent. The customer told her to ‘go back to her country’ and threw the ham at her face,” Robles said. “Some customers are not understanding. I just wish people were considerate.”Marisol Galarza is a daycare provider in Round Rock, Texas. Despite the soaring cases in the state, Galarza said the daycare is seeing new enrollments each week.“Our director is giving us the option to take breaks from work if we’re not comfortable but we have bills so we can’t really do that,” she said.Galarza’s workplace has been implementing safeguards to prevent the spread of the virus such as placing kids 6ft apart during nap time, but Galarza says she remains nervous.“The kids wear their masks below their nose or under their chin,” Galarza said. “It’s so hard because you don’t want to tell them not to hug their friends.”Since the pandemic, Galarza said she has considered changing careers.“This is not going to be sustainable. We’re going to be at high risk with high-capacity classrooms. I wash my hands after everything I do and I put on gloves. I see some teachers not even washing their hands.”“The economy was prioritized over human life. The desire to make money was prioritized over human life,” Imo said. “That is terrible. The current people who are in charge who fumbled this response need to be voted out.”Imo said she had already witnessed the toll the virus has taken on herself and her colleagues.“I got assigned to the ICU the first month of my program. We have had to limit visitors so people cannot visit their family members who are critically ill,” Imo said. “But the attendings I work with in the Covid unit are bearing the brunt of it.”Imo said it was an overwhelming time to be entering medicine.“I have grown to think about medicine as a calling but it’s interesting for that idea to be tested so early in my career,” Imo said. “I’m willing to take the risk but I didn’t think I’d have to take it on so early.”When asked about Texas’s outlook over the next few months, she said: “The community spread rate is so high. The word pandemic is not just being used to scare people. The media is not blowing it up. This is serious.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0210a57b6ba1caf7eecb3280760d46dc9a747329/879_587_3113_1868/master/3113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72d35af7fce985c1373f832c3942a8e5","title":"us politics joe biden vice president pick us elections","story":"Coronavirus cases remain high in Florida, one of the US hotspots for the virus. On Saturday, the state’s health department reported 9,591 new cases of the disease and 179 new deaths. It is the fifth day in a row the state has reported more than 9,000 new cases, although it is down from the recent period when more than 10,000 new daily cases were regularly reported.Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration says 7,942 people are currently in hospital with the virus, down from the just over 8,000 people last weekend. Florida’s department of health says 7,022 people have now died from Covid-19 in the state.A record-setting quarterly fall in US economic growth was announced earlier this week. The news came as another 1.43 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits.House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer met with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday in Pelosi’s office to discuss the next stage in benefits.Pelosi said she hopes “that we make progress on a long-term deal”, while Mnuchin told reporters: “We’re just hopeful that they’re willing really to negotiate today, if they are, we’re prepared to make a deal on behalf of the American people.”The two parties are still far apart. Democrats see the $600 payments as vital for keeping families and iniduals fed and housed during the pandemic, while Republicans believe they discourage people from seeking work. On Friday, Meadows said Democrats are “playing politics at a critical time”, while Pelosi countered that Republicans are “disrespectful of the needs of America’s working families.”Erum Salam in Houston has news of the surge in Covid-19 cases in Texas:An older man in an orange apron greets customers at the Home Depot in College Station, Texas. Signs serving as a reminder they are living through a pandemic are plastered on the sliding glass doors: “Face covering required.”The reminder is much needed because to an outsider, Texas looked almost the same in July 2019 as it does in July 2020, despite Covid-19 having claimed more than 6,000 lives in the state and more than 150,000 lives in the US since March.Customers at the home improvement store walk in wearing masks, which have become highly politicized, only to lower them below their chins to speak or remove them altogether.In the upscale neighborhood of Montrose in Houston, the multi-story Agora coffee house is full of people hungry for coffee, pastries and conversation.

It’s the 12th day he has spent golfing out of the last 36. His motorcade was booed by a group of dogwalkers, while another person held a sign up reading “We are good trouble”, a reference to congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis who died last month. A man in a “Make America Great Again” cap saluted the motorcade as it passed.The president fired off a few tweets last night, repeating his familiar line that Covid-19 cases in the US are surging due to increased testing (which doesn’t explain the sharp rise in deaths). He also turned his attention to a familiar enemy: protesters in Portland. “Homeland Security is not leaving Portland until local police complete cleanup of Anarchists and Agitators!” he tweeted on Friday night. And no sooner has Karen Bass emerged as a frontrunner for Biden’s vice-presidential pick than stories, probably not discouraged by her rivals, bubble to the surface. Rightwing website the Daily Caller reports that Bass praised Scientology for its “commitment…to make a difference” during the opening of a Scientology building in California in 2010. During the ceremony Bass also praised Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard for his belief that “all people of whatever race, color or creed, are created with equal rights”.Scientology has come under intense scrutiny after claims of physical, psychological and sexual abuse against its followers, accusations detailed in documentaries such as Going Clear by Alex Gibney, which focused on former members of the church.The Church of Scientology denies the allegations of abuse and mistreatment among its ranks. Good morning. As November’s election approaches speculation over who Joe Biden will pick as his running mate mounts. The presumptive Democratic candidate for president has promised he will pick a woman as his running mate and his list of candidates is beginning to narrow.CNN reports that 11 candidates are in the running. Kamala Harris remains the oddsmakers’ favourite, and Biden was seen holding a list with her name and handwritten notes about the California senator on it. However, in recent days, Karen Bass, congresswoman and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, has emerged as a frontrunner, and Politico reports that members of Harris’s team requested a meeting with Biden after learning their candidate was not a shoo-in for the VP slot. Harris is reported to have suffered after not showing contrition for remarks she made last year that appeared to depict Biden as racially insensitive. Biden was supposed to name his running mate next week, but Politico reports the selection is now more likely to be announced in mid-August. Other names in the running who have been vetted by Biden’s team include Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth Florida congresswoman Val Demings Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and governors Gretchen Whitmer and Michelle Lujan Grisham.Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a Biden supporter, told CNN that Bass is seen as a safer choice than Harris. “Kamala can rub some people the wrong way. Karen Bass is not likely to do that,” Rendell said. “The number one rule for picking the VP? Do no harm.”One outside candidate gaining some momentum is Susan Rice, Barack Obama’s former national security adviser. Although she lacks the campaigning experience of Bass and Harris, she worked with Biden during his own time as vice-president and has vast experience in global relations, which could prove invaluable during a time of turmoil around the world.“If there ever was a time to pick someone without campaign experience, this would be the year,” a former member of Obama’s administration who has worked closely with Rice told CNN. “Susan would be the best governing partner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c61538eaf345c2efcaad60fc686a2dd5ce31c6fb/149_0_2512_1508/master/2512.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e5b7343a10e09effc1854c10ca6c0eb4","title":"cubans bid farewell to eusebio leal spengler the saviour of havana","story":"Much-loved citizen was born poor but went on to mastermind restoration of the island’s splendid capitalThe old town of Havana has sheltered many famous faces over its 500 years, Alexander von Humboldt and Ernest Hemingway among them, but few more loved than Eusebio Leal Spengler, who died on Friday.The city historian could be seen most days walking through the cobbled streets, past the fruit hawkers and musicians, passing under balconies strung with drying sheets. He would stop to talk to residents who knew him by sight, despite his understated manner and the grey guayabera shirt of the Cuban bureaucrat he favoured.Leal had a reputation for sorting out people’s problems, however small. Last week however, Cuba’s president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, called him “the Cuban who saved Havana”.Leal was born in 1942 and, although poor, he educated himself as a historian. He was fascinated by the city around him. One of his earliest acts was to save a street cobbled in wood outside the old governor general’s palace from being permanently covered in asphalt.According to the city’s mythology, it had been originally laid in wood to muffle the wheels of passing carriages so that the governor general could enjoy his siesta. It is one curious detail in a city that contains masterpieces from almost every period in the last half millennium, be it baroque, art deco, art nouveau or Soviet realist.Never a priority in the 20th century, old Havana fell into disrepair. By befriending Fidel Castro, Leal began the process of bringing it back. He managed to get the old town designated a Unesco world heritage site, and then gather enough money from Europe to start putting the buildings back together.In the 1990s, Leal convinced Castro of the benefits of setting up a for-profit company that would invest tourist dollars back into the restoration. He started with the Hotel Ambos Mundos, where Hemingway wrote, and then his teams spread out.Now, the old town, hard by the great bay which made Havana so important during Spain’s plundering of the Americas, is a maze of exquisite buildings whose narrow streets give way to perfect squares containing, say, the baroque cathedral. It was particularly dear to Leal’s heart as a committed Catholic. And everywhere local life continues.Leal insisted that old Havana not become a sterile version of the past, populated only by tourists. His willingness to convert colonial buildings into maternity hospitals and schools, as well as hotels and restaurants – while solving people’s problems on his way to work – made him so popular that after Fidel died, he was tipped for high office. Instead, as he slowly succumbed to cancer, his teams finally finished rebuilding the Capitolio, a vast edifice that resembles the US Capitol and which is slated to be the future seat of Cuba’s National Assembly. Its gold dome now shines over the city he rebuilt. Yesterday residents across the city were hanging white sheets from their balconies in tribute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e07f909feaf0dedb5a6860997ae9e23664e13b79/0_65_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e943e5507a978dbbf18765965da4f1fe","title":"hurricane isaias bahamas florida north carolina","story":"State readies evacuation centers with social-distancing measures as Bahamas and North Carolina order evacuationsHurricane Isaias ripped shingles off roofs and blew over trees as it carved its way through the Bahamas early on Saturday and headed toward the Florida coast, where officials in Miami said they were closing beaches, marinas and parks.Miami’s mayor, Carlos Giménez, said on Friday that 20 evacuation centers were on standby that could be set up with Covid-19 safety measures.“We still don’t think there is a need to open shelters for this storm, but they are ready,” he said.Authorities in North Carolina ordered the evacuation of Ocracoke Island, which was slammed by last year’s Hurricane Dorian, starting Saturday evening. Meanwhile, officials in the Bahamas evacuated people on Abaco island, who have been living in temporary structures since Dorian. People living in the eastern end of Grand Bahama were also being moved.Isaias had maximum sustained winds of 85mph (135kph) on Saturday morning and some strengthening was possible later Saturday, the US National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The storm was centered about 80 miles (125km) south-south-east of Nassau in the Bahamas and was moving north-west at 12mph (19kph). Forecasters said some decrease in its forward motion was expected.Paula Miller, Mercy Corps director for the Bahamas, told the Associated Press that while the islands can normally withstand strong hurricanes, some have been destabilized by the coronavirus pandemic and the damage caused by Dorian.“With everything not quite shored up, property not secured, home not prepared, even a category 1 will be enough to set them back,” she said.A hurricane warning was in effect for Florida’s east coast from Boca Raton, just north of Miami, about 150 miles (241km) north to the Volusia-Brevard county line. A hurricane watch was in effect from Hallendale Beach to south of Boca Raton.Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, said the state was “fully prepared for this and any future storm during this hurricane season”, with stockpiles of personal protective equipment, generators, bottled water and meals ready to be distributed.But he urged people to have seven days of food, water and medication on hand and said state-run coronavirus testing sites in the areas where the storm could hit would be closed.Miami’s mayor said that social-distancing measures prompted by Covid-19 meant each person in shelters needed to have 40 sq ft (3.7 sq meters) and no more cafeteria-style dining would be allowed. People who are infected with the new coronavirus and need to evacuate will be isolated in classrooms separate from the general population, Giménez said.A hurricane warning was in effect for north-west and central Bahamas.“Continue to hunker down,” said Trevor Basden, director of the Bahamas meteorology department.Two of those islands, Abaco and Grand Bahama, were battered by Dorian, a category 5 storm that hovered over the area for two days and killed at least 70 people, with more than 280 reported missing. People are still living in tents on both islands, and officials said crews tried to remove leftover debris ahead of Isaias.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis relaxed a coronavirus lockdown as a result of the storm, but imposed a 10pm to 5am curfew. He said supermarkets, pharmacies, gas stations and hardware stores would be open as long as weather permitted.The Bahamas has reported more than 570 confirmed Covid-19 cases and at least 14 deaths. It recently barred travelers from the US following a surge in cases after it reopened to international tourism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a7226ea6b6b827a30b07c0840601fc165486981/0_49_962_577/master/962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ade7141f5164bb3afa74e4211d4c88e","title":"pubs england close control coronavirus adviser graham medley","story":"The government may have to consider closing pubs in England to control the transmission of the coronavirus and to enable schools to reopen after the summer holidays, one of its top scientific advisers has said.Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) sub-group on pandemic modelling, said reopening schools was a priority for the wellbeing of children and that some other activities might have to stop to control the infection rate.The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine academic told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we’re in a situation whereby most people think that opening schools is a priority for the health and wellbeing of children and that when we do that we are going to reconnect lots of households.“And so actually, closing some of the other networks, some of the other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools. It might come down to a question of which do you trade off against each other and then that’s a matter of prioritising, do we think pubs are more important than schools?”Boris Johnson raised the threat on Friday of a second national lockdown as he paused new freedoms scheduled this weekend amid fears that any further reopening of the economy could trigger a full-blown resurgence of the virus. Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said the UK had “probably reached near the limit of what we can do” if the virus was to be kept under control.Medley said the increased lockdown measures in areas across the north-west of England introduced on Thursday night were “highly unlikely” to be the final regional intervention.He said the rise in coronavirus infections appeared to be among younger people but there was a danger it could “spill” over into other parts of the population.“The age distribution of infections has changed, it has moved down into younger age groups and so it is likely we won’t see that increase in hospital admissions related to infection in the same way we did in March,” he said. “But the big fear is the virus just gets out of control and we end up in a situation where there is so much virus that it inevitably spills out into all sections of the population.”Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest that infection rates in England are rising, with about 4,200 new cases of coronavirus a day, compared with an estimated 2,800 a week ago. However, this increase is thought to be far below levels seen during the pandemic’s peak.It has emerged that Sage considered a paper in early July, just before the pubs reopened, warning that the possibility of serious disorder in the coming months could “overwhelm all attempts” to control coronavirus and “catastrophically” undermine recovery plans.“Put simply, a serious deterioration of public order could overwhelm all attempts to control contagion, overwhelm hospitals, the criminal justice system and hinder revival of the economy.”The research, prepared by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) policing and security sub-group, described a “volatile and highly complex situation” in which tensions resulting from the pandemic have become “inextricably bound” with structural inequalities and international events.The authors cited the Black Lives Matter movement and an increasing sense of “racial injustice, inequality and discrimination” felt among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, which have been disproportionately affected by the virus.At the same time, the authors said extreme rightwing groups are mobilising at a scale not seen for a decade, and exploiting fatal stabbing incidents in Reading, London and Glasgow. Any serious public disorder that developed would be likely to require military involvement, they said.Large-scale protests, celebrations and unlicensed music events have been increasing, as public health messaging became less clear, the authors added in the paper titled, Public Disorder and Public Health: Contemporary Threats and Risks.The scapegoating of various communities, and a sense of inequality or grievance due to localised lockdowns, could also stoke flames, they warned.“There is already a view among London’s black community that large gatherings on beaches, or outside Anfield, involving predominantly white and older communities, largely see no police intervention of scale,” the report read.“In contrast, large gatherings in streets or parks with music and dancing with predominantly BAME communities or young people result in police intervention.”On Friday, the prime minister did not distance himself from remarks by a Tory MP claiming the “vast majority” of people breaching coronavirus lockdown rules were from BAME communities, particularly those from Muslim backgrounds. He said only that it was “up to the whole country to get this right”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/355255f9be6bc0307c17dc6c436ef3c802a85e4d/388_378_5073_3047/master/5073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8039509080cdcf8c72374c98ebe440a2","title":"quiz how well do you understand the uks coronavirus lockdown restrictions","story":"With different regulations applying in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, test yourself on the current restrictionsAfter a University College London study recently suggested that confidence in understanding coronavirus lockdown restrictions varies greatly across the UK and has dropped significantly since the early days of the measures in March, we thought we’d test you on what you know.

China said the legislation targets the crimes of “secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces” and carries penalties as severe as life in prison.Critics warned that it would be used to target legitimate opposition, and highlighted the unusual decision to make the law applicable to both Hong Kong residents and non-residents. That apparently gives China jurisdiction beyond its own borders.Chu, who runs the Hong Kong Democracy Council, a Washington DC-based advocacy organization dedicated to furthering Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy, is the first person targeted under this aspect of the law.He said China was sending a clear message to other activists by ordering his arrest.“I would really emphasize how outrageous this really is,” Chu told the . “I am the first non-Chinese citizen that essentially is being targeted. I think they do intend to try to make this an example.”Several countries have since suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong, including the UK, Australia and Germany, as a possible safeguard against attempts to use the national security laws to round up activists abroad. The US ordered an end to Hong Kong’s special economic status earlier in July.Chu, who has lived in the US as an American citizen since 1996, said the charges amounted to China “targeting a US citizen for lobbying my own government”.“We always knew that when the national security law went into effect there was a very troubling and illogical, irrational idea that they were claiming jurisdiction over anyone who is not even a Hong Kong resident, who is anywhere in the world, doing anything that they deemed threatening,” he said.The other activists charged wereRay Wong, Wayne Chan and Honcques Laus.Wong, who is currently in the UK, told Reuters the charges showed that the Chinese government was afraid of the advocacy work of Hong Kong activists internationally.“I think they want to cut off our connection with people in Hong Kong … it will make people fear that they may violate the national security law by contacting us,” Wong said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/305040acf052c63a60cc5eea6edc21daff749130/0_128_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bd13e142cf1a3deeb43ce91a49900fc","title":"coronavirus live news who reports record global daily cases as easing on hold in england","story":"Vietnamese tourist hotspot of Da Nang to test entire city Boris Johnson warns of second UK lockdown.

Please feel free to message me with relevant updates or tips, you can get me on Twitter @JedySays or via email.Hundreds have ignored London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plea to stay at home and not attend the annual Afrikan Emancipation Day Reparations march in Brixton. Protesters gathered at Windrush Square in Brixton, south London, for the Afrikan Emancipation Day. A number of demonstrators temporarily blocked Brixton Road at the junction with Acre Lane, forcing cars and buses to stop and turn around, PA reports.Protesters, including some from Extinction Rebellion, occupied the middle of the junction until they were told to get back on to the curb by police officers.Crowds of people listened to music in Windrush Square while a group of police officers stood nearby. A short distance away, another group observed speeches before a three-minute silence was held.A further four people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in hospitals to 29,342, PA reports.The patients were aged between 78 and 84 years old and all had known underlying health conditions.Another five deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result.Ending support for extremely vulnerable people shielding from coronavirus while pausing the easing of lockdown restrictions in England has been described by a leading charity as “perverse”.Age UK has said it no longer made sense to end the advice for vulnerable people to stay at home, since rising infection rates led to additional lockdown restrictions in parts of northern England and the pausing of further easing in the rest of the country.As of Saturday, more than 2 million people who are extremely clinically vulnerable to coronavirus are no longer being advised by governments in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to stay at home, or shield. Many people have expressed concern that they feel forced to return to the workplace even though they do not think it is safe and the virus is still circulating.Caroline Abrahams, the director of Age UK, said:With a number of lockdown easements firmly on hold and millions under new restrictions in the north it seems perverse for shielding, and the supports it brings, to be paused as of today.There might have been a rationale for this pause when it was originally announced, a couple of weeks ago, but surely not now. Many shielding older workers, for example, are likely to be feeling distinctly nervous if they are required by their employer to return to their workplace on Monday.A third person died of coronavirus complications in Vietnam, AP reports, a day after the country recorded its first death from the disease.All three died in a hospital in Da Nang, a hot spot with more than 100 cases in the past week, more than half of them patients.The Health Ministry said the latest fatalities included a 68-year old woman who was treated for blood cancer and a 61 year-old man who suffered septic shock and chronic kidney failure. The country’s first COVID-19 death was a 70-year-old who was admitted with a kidney illness.Da Nang is Vietnams most popular beach destination, and thousands of visitors were in the city for summer vacation. Across the country, authorities are rushing to test people who have returned home from the coastal city.Staff at a hospital in north-west England are to be rapidly tested for coronavirus to “control the spread of the infection”.Stockport NHS foundation trust said a “small number” of patients and staff had been identified as having the virus and that swift and widespread testing would take place over the next five days.We have begun a process of rapid staff testing for Covid-19 to strengthen our efforts to prevent and control the spread of the infection across Stepping Hill Hospital.Changes to lockdown arrangements across parts of the North of England reflect the prevalence of the infection in our local communities, and recently we have identified a small number of infections amongst staff and patients. We have taken rapid action to safeguard ourselves and the people who need our care. On Friday evening we began the rapid testing programme that over the next five days will see all our hospital staff tested. Staff found to have the infection will be required to self-isolate in line with national guidelines.Several small boats filled with more Tunisian migrants have reached a tiny Italian island that has run out of room to quarantine them as required by Italy’s anti-coronavirus measures, AP reports citing local officials.The Sicilian daily newspaper Giornale di Sicilia quoted the Lampedusa mayor, Totò Martello, as saying the island could not wait until the government sent a chartered ferry.The island’s migrant holding centre was built for a maximum capacity of 95 people and was already holding 950 when the latest passengers arrived, Martello said.The 250 who arrived between Friday night and Saturday must stay on the dock for now, until the promised ferry arrives or some other solution is found.The Vietnamese coastal city of Danang plans to test its entire population of 1.1 million people for coronavirus, the governing authorities said on Saturday, as 40 new cases linked to the tourist spot were reported across the country, taking total infections to 586, with three deaths.Most of the new cases are linked to hospitals in Danang city, where the first locally transmitted infection in more than three months was detected last week.The Health Ministry said on Saturday that up to 800,000 visitors to Danang have left for other parts of the country since July 1, adding that more than 41,000 people have visited three hospitals in the city since.Local medical officials in Danang have conducted 8,247 coronavirus tests in the city since July 25, when the latest cluster was first detected. Testing capacity will be increased to 8,000-10,000 per day, the governing authorities said.Vietnam has detected new coronavirus cases in other cities, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with links to Danang.Meanwhile, authorities of the capital city, Hanoi said late on Saturday it had carried out around 49,000 tests since Thursday after the city ordered mass testing for all people who recently returned from the popular coastal city.PA reports there were 260 people in hospital with Covid-19 and three in intensive care. No new deaths have been recorded among people who tested positive for the virus, meaning the total under this measurement remains at 2,491.Public Health Wales said a further two people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in the country to 1,562.The number of cases in Wales increased by 21, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 17,279.Thousands of protesters against German coronavirus restrictions converged in Berlin on Saturday for a demonstration proclaiming the end of the pandemic – just as authorities voice increasing concern about an upturn in new infections, AP reports.A crowd of people whistling and cheering, and with few masks in sight, marched through central Berlin from the Brandenburg Gate before a rally on a wide boulevard that runs through the Tiergarten park.Protesters held up home-made placards featuring slogans that included “Corona, false alarm”, “We are being forced to wear a muzzle”, “Natural defence instead of vaccination” and “End the corona panic – bring fundamental rights back”.They chanted: “We’re here and we’re loud, because we are being robbed of our freedom.”Travellers entering France from 16 countries where coronavirus is circulating widely are having to undergo virus tests upon arrival at French airports and ports.French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced last month that the tests would be required starting Aug. 1 for the arriving passengers France is allowing in from the listed countries unless they present proof of a negative test done within 72 hours of their departure.Those who test positive in France as of Saturday must quarantine for 14 days.France is not permitting general travel to and from the 16 countries, which include the United States and Brazil. The testing requirement therefore only applies to people entering under limited circumstances - French citizens who live in these countries or citizens of these countries with an established residence in France, Castex has said.Edinburgh Castle has reopened after the coronavirus lockdown, which caused the fortress to shut for its longest period since the second world war.Historic Environment Scotland (HES) reopened the doors of the ancient stronghold on Saturday, along with other historic sites like Stirling Castle and Urquhart Castle.The castle in the centre of Edinburgh has long been one of Scotland’s most popular tourist destinations, but capacity will be reduced and some areas will be restricted in line with social distancing rules.Tickets must be booked in advance and face coverings will be required in the castle’s shops.In the past few weeks, Paul Feeley has been abused four times for not wearing a mask on public transport. “I have a disability lanyard, which signifies I have a hidden disability. I tried to show it … And all I got back was a complete torrent of abuse.”The most recent incident took place just after he first spoke to the Observer on Thursday. The abuse has made Feeley, who suffers from fibromyalgia, borderline personality disorder and panic attacks, feel “extraordinarily angry, anxious and upset”. He is unable to wear a face covering because of his medical conditions, and legally he is exempt – but he is now worried about travelling on buses and trams in his home town of Manchester. “One man said to me: ‘If you can’t wear a mask, you shouldn’t be allowed out.’”Incidents of “mask rage” are making disabled people who are unable to wear a covering fearful of going out in public, charities warn, as they call on the government to raise awareness about the legitimate reasons many people cannot wear them."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"National agenda derailed by judgment, but Minister notes decision key to political focusDecision a reminder that failure on climate commitments is actionable in court of lawCoalition will have to devise new plan following ruling of seven-judge court"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Inidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping change"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318097.1596136727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"12 ways of avoiding dementia identified in major new study","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe authors call for nine ambitious actions to be undertaken by policymakers and iniduals. Photograph:iStockModifying 12 risk factors over the course of one’s life could delay or prevent 40 per cent of dementia cases, according to the latest verdict of The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care.The commission has added three new “key modifiable risks factors” that make people more vulnerable to dementia excessive alcohol consumption in mid-life, suffering head injuries in mid-life and exposure to air pollution in later life. Led by 28 world-leading dementia experts, the report builds on the nine risk factors from childhood to later life identified in 2017, and provides an up-to-date analysis of the best evidence on the prevention of dementia. “The potential to prevent cases of dementia is high,” it adds.Its latest report presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference on Thursday calls of states and iniduals to be ambitious about preventing dementia and lays out a set of policies and lifestyle changes to help prevent dementia. Worldwide around 50 million people live with dementia, a figure projected to increase to 152 million by 2050, rising particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where around two-thirds of people with dementia live. Dementia affects iniduals, their families, and the economy - with global costs estimated at about €1 trillion annually.Combined, the three new risk factors are associated with 6 per cent of all dementia cases – with an estimated 3 per cent of cases attributable to head injuries in mid-life 1 per cent of cases to excessive alcohol consumption (more than 21 units per week) in mid-life, and 2 per cent to exposure to air pollution in later life. The remaining risk factors are associated with 34 per cent of all dementia cases. The factors associated with the greatest proportion of dementia cases in the population are less education in early life hearing loss in mid-life, and smoking in later life (7 per cent, 8 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively).In certain countries, however, the proportion of older people with dementia has fallen, probably due to improvements in education, nutrition, healthcare, and lifestyle changes – demonstrating the possibility of reducing dementia through preventative measures, it concludes.“Our report shows it is within the power of policy-makers and iniduals to prevent and delay a significant proportion of dementia, with opportunities to make an impact at each stage of a person’s life,” says lead author Prof Gill Livingston of University College London, UK. “Interventions are likely to have the biggest impact on those who are disproportionately affected by dementia risk factors, like those in low- and middle-income countries and vulnerable populations, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities,” he added. Prof Livingston added: “As societies, we need to think beyond promoting good health to prevent dementia, and begin tackling inequalities to improve the circumstances in which people live their lives.” Risks could be reduced by creating active and healthy environments for communities, “where physical activity is the norm, better diet is accessible for all, and exposure to excessive alcohol is minimised”. The authors call for nine ambitious actions to be undertaken by policymakers and iniduals: – Aim to maintain systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) or less in midlife from around age 40 years– Encourage use of hearing aids for hearing loss reduce hearing loss by protecting ears from high noise levels– Reduce exposure to air pollution and second-hand tobacco smoke– Prevent head injury (particularly by targeting high-risk occupations and transport)– Prevent alcohol misuse and limit drinking to less than 21 units per week– Stop smoking uptake and support iniduals to stop smoking (which the authors stress is beneficial at any age)– Provide all children with primary and secondary education– Lead an active life into mid, and possibly later life – Reduce obesity and diabetes. These actions, they say, are especially important in LMICs such as China, India and Latin America, where dementia rates are rising more rapidly than in high-income countries. This is due to increasing life expectancy, and a higher frequency of dementia risk factors such as lower rates of education high rates of hypertension, obesity, hearing loss and rapidly growing rates of diabetes. The authors note they were careful to only include risk factors with strong evidence for a causal link. Their report calls for holistic and inidualised evidence-based care that addresses physical and mental health, social care, and support that can accommodate complex needs of those with dementia. “Keeping people with dementia physically healthy is important for their cognition but they often have other illnesses which they may struggle to manage on their own, resulting in potentially harmful preventable hospitalisations,” it notes.

Photograph: Paul FaithGettyAFPThe Government’s decision to wait until next week to decide whether pubs should reopen on August 10th is “deeply unhelpful” and “adding real stress” to publicans and staff across the country, the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) has said.The Cabinet is due to decide on Tuesday whether or not to proceed with phase four of the reopening roadmap.Phase four would mean pubs which do not serve food could reopen as well as gatherings of up to 100 people indoors and 500 outdoors.On Friday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the number of Covid-19 cases would be monitored “very carefully” over the weekend before te Cabinet made its decision.Donall O’Keefe, chief executive of the LVA, which represents publicans in Dublin said guidelines for reopening pubs were supposed to be published three weeks ago.“They were then meant to be published this week. They weren’t. So we now have pubs across the country having to guess if they will be able to open on August 10th and also having to guess what rules will then apply to them,” he said.“This isn’t conducive to effective preparation. We see absolutely no reason why the guidelines couldn’t have been published earlier.”Mr O’Keefe said by August 10th pubs will have had “no income” for just under 150 days, which is more than 40 per cent of the year.“In Dublin alone at least 2,450 pubs jobs have already been lost in that period and 11 pubs have gone out of business. Further delays will result in more job losses, more stress on these publicans and their staff and more businesses closing their doors for good,” he added.“The pub sector is the last industry to reopen, despite being the first to close. We have been singled out. If this treatment is to continue then the Government needs to be forthcoming about what they plan to do to protect the future of a sector which continues to be deprived of an opportunity to earn a living at the request of the Government.”The Vintners’ Federation of Ireland (VFI), which represents publicans outside the greater Dublin area, said public health is the number one priority but “as the experts learn more about the virus it’s clear a blanket ban on pubs opening is not the answer”.“In Australia, where there is a substantial increase in Covid cases, pubs in Victoria will remain open because the authorities view pubs as a safe, controlled environment where social distancing can be enforced,” said Padraig Cribben, chief executive of the VFI.“They view house gatherings, which are now banned, as more dangerous. We need that type of approach here in Ireland.”Mr Cribben said publicans have been forced to order stock and rehire staff “once again” before the Government has announced its decision on reopening pubs.“No other sector is being treated in this manner and, it should be noted, this is the third deadline publicans have faced with no guarantee they will be allowed open,” he said.“The delay in publishing guidelines is a further blow to our members. With just one week to the planned reopening, publicans remain in the dark about what specific protocols will be introduced. For instance, can customers sit at the bar counter? This is a hugely important issue for rural pubs and if the counter is off limits many publicans say they won’t bother opening.”Friday night saw 38 additional cases of Covid-19 reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team following a spike of 85 new cases on Thursday. Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn warned “we may be beginning to see more cases which we cannot link to outbreaks or close contacts”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4319827.1596281711!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new cultural officer seeks to boost germany s image of ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe first full-time cultural officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs Candice Gordon, pictured wearing a jumpsuit by Irish designer @youreonlygorgeous (Violet Ogden). Photograph:  Tom TaylorIreland’s image in Germany is “positive but limited”, with ingrained ideas of hard-drinking wild Celts playing traditional music, says Candice Gordon, as she holds court in a Berlin cafe near a noisy coffee roasting machineFrom now on, it is the job of Gordon, the newly-appointed and first full-time cultural officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), to bring that image into a new era based in the Irish embassy in Berlin.“It’s important to honour that heritage but I’m keen to bring our image forward in a more adventurous, progressive direction,” she tells The .Gordon is the first in a series of cultural officer appointments being made in seven locations around the world. New York and London will follow shortly, followed later by Beijing, Tokyo, Paris and Los Angeles.Cultural diplomacy is an intriguing change of change of pace for the northside Dubliner who, aged 12, discovered her love of performing with busking. She then ran away with a circus to France before returning to song-writing and composing, with a sideline in political salons.Nearly a decade after she moved to Berlin, she is anxious to help other Irish artists discover the opportunities and potential she has found in Germany. Collectively, she hopes to refashion how Ireland is viewed in Germany - and vice versa.The idea of a full-time cultural officer was first mentioned in a 2018 report about how Ireland could develop a “wider, deeper” footprint with its largest EU partner.Much on the to-do list has been achieved, from a new consulate in Frankfurt to regular high-level Irish-German ministerial meetings. Another key recommendation was that serious cultural spending is not an optional extra but a prerequisite for a more enriching, sustainable relationship with Germany.While Ireland sells itself as the island of saints and scholars, Germany pitches itself as a nation of thinkers and poets. So Gordon’s new job, likely to require the patience of a saint, will be to match Irish and German scholars, thinkers, poets, singers, painters, dancers - and more.“Cultural diplomacy is about opening dialogue and finding connections between countries, not forcing things down people’s throats,” she says. Her three-year role, she says, will make a contribution to shifting the relationship from fuzzy mutual regard to deeper mutual understanding.‘Nostaglic view’Whether Kerrygold or the Kelly Family, many Irish-themed successes in Germany have their roots in the “Irish Journal” by Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll in 1957.Nearly seven decades on, Gordon sees ample room to expand that romantic-nostalgia view of Ireland, fixed in many German minds, by highlighting the island’s technological prowess, film and animation capabilities - as well as considerable talent pools in opera, dance and the visual arts.Pushing into Germany’s cultural landscape, though, presents Gordon’s second challenge: to reshape often limited Irish attitudes to Germany. The country’s vast, decentralised structure of 16 federal states means even regional cities have full orchestras, opera houses and arts schools. In a country of 83 million, says Gordon, even fringe interests have festivals and loyal followers.The new cultural diplomacy strategy, part of the Global Ireland plan running to 2025, is co-ordinated from Dublin by Eugene Downes, cultural director of the DFA, in close partnership with Culture Ireland.The DFA’s new cultural unit was established a year ago amid the realisation that, despite punching above its weight internationally on culture, Ireland’s cultural diplomacy is underdeveloped in many key countries, particularly Germany.No figures are available on how much money will be earmarked for the new cultural push in Germany, though a key priority is a large-scale cultural year similar to the 2011 Imagine Ireland year in the US that cost €5 billion.As Brexit reshapes Ireland’s relationship with its closest neighbour, leading figures in the arts and German-Irish community have welcomed the chance to build new cultural bridges.“There has never been more interest in this than now, from both Germany and Ireland,” said Dr Gisela Holfter, director of the University of Limerick’s Centre for Irish-German Studies. “But this opportunity needs to be seized and followed up at all levels and special attention needs to be paid to language learning and research into bilateral relations.”With performance, partnerships and salon-style events, Gordon hopes to give all voices a platform in the coming years.“It’s important there is freedom to do events with a critical view of Ireland,” she said. “And it’s appealing to do that here in Germany, where it is almost part of their cultural identity to look at the shadows. I think they would really appreciate it if we do the same thing.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4319856.1596295726!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sunny south east to get the best of the bank holiday weather","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeer grazing in Phoenix Park on Friday.

Scattered showers in the west and north west of the country will become widespread through the afternoon occasionally turning heavy. Afternoon temperatures of 15 to 18 degrees in light to moderate, occasionally fresh westerly winds are forecast. Rain is due to move into the east coast in late afternoon. Monday will see some sunny spells everywhere with some sunshine over the northern half of the country and in west Kerry. A few light showers are possible in the north and west. Highest temperatures of 15 to 18 degrees are expected with mostly moderate westerly winds.People travelling on public transport over the Bank Holiday weekend have been asked to remember the health advice is still to only travel for essential purposes. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has warned of the potential for the spread of Covid-19 over the Bank Holiday weekend and said elements of Phase 4 of the reopening due on August 10th, may depend on the spread of the virus over the Bank Holiday.Those planning to use public transport should remember it is mandatory to wear face masks and capacity on trains and buses is still restricted.

Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Infections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Last week I was yelled over and shut down on ITV’s Good Morning Britain for disagreeing with their stance. In that context, I was pleased to see schools minister Nick Gibb showing the bravery to oppose the idea of a “black curriculum”, a term that is troubling in itself.How do we define “black history”? Is the history of Britain not our history, too? I resent the implication that black people have a separate, segregated history and that “British” history belongs solely to white people. This campaign not only raises more questions than it answers – it comes across as fundamentally racist.Mr Gibb was correct when he pointed out that the curriculum is “broad and balanced” and “can also include the role of the countries of the former British Empire in both World Wars, and the part black and minority ethnic people have played in shaping the UK in the 20th century”.History is an essential subject at school. We want young people to understand their past: doing so helps them to develop critical thinking and the ability to reach judgments based on evidence they’ve weighed up and arguments they’ve sifted.What we as teachers do not, and must never do, is present a narrative, in one direction or another. History isn’t there for us to like or dislike it just is. And yet some people are desperate to use history as a political tool. Fiddling around with the curriculum – which is designed by subject experts to maximise our limited teaching time – based on current events and political issues of the day is a very dangerous game to play. What’s more, activists campaigning for more black history on the curriculum are often arguing from an uninformed position. It’s easy to provide anecdotes about what we remember being taught when we were schoolchildren ourselves but how much research has been done on what is currently being taught in history lessons in schools? I’d suggest not a lot, based on the arguments I’ve seen.We already teach about the British Empire, colonialism, the Commonwealth, immigration to and from Britain over the ages, the ersity of European migrants and early African and Asian migrants – and that’s just a few of the modules currently available.As Mr Gibb pointed out, we have a number of influential black figures on the curriculum, including, but by no means limited to, figures such as Rosa Parks and Mary Seacole. This isn’t exclusive to GCSE , either. These are things we teach right through from Key Stage 1, at five years of age.I’d like to know what precisely these activists think is missing from the curriculum, and what they’d remove to replace it. This is a zero-sum game. We have a limited amount of time in the classroom to pass on knowledge would these campaigners be happy removing the Tudors or the Stuarts in favour of more black figures? That would hardly be an accurate representation of British history.What is more important than this social justice warrior campaign is that we teach topics like parliamentary democracy, which we helped spread throughout the world. We need to ensure we keep teaching about prominent Brits who shaped our nation and the globe, such as Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web. These are people who will inspire a new generation of young British students of every skin colour.What’s actually happening here is a further attempt to cause ision and stoke up racial tensions. I’m not sure this campaign has much to do with young people – who tend not to see their race as their sole identity. This is more about addressing the insecurities of a particular sub-section of adults stuck in a victimhood mentality.The idea that if young black people see more black people in their history books, it will somehow improve their self-esteem is totally wrong. All the evidence seems to demonstrate the opposite, that by separating the curriculum into black and white the campaigners are going to cause problems where there were none to begin with.This is not to mention the fact that it’s an insult to attempt to lump all black people into one box as if we all subscribe to a unified “black” identity. It’s time to treat people as iniduals who are part of a greater whole. Let’s not encourage the breaking up of pupils into groups by their race and work on bringing them all together as proud Brits, positive contributors to a wider community.Rather than focus on the things that ide us, we’d do better to teach our young people that British history belongs to all of us, and that is something that unites us, regardless of race, creed, or religion.Calvin Robinson is an assistant principal in the state sectorMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cant hold breath forever time learned live virus","story":"There is a moment in the George Clooney film Up in the Air, about an executive who spends much of his working life at 30,000ft, when Clooney’s character explains how to speed through airport security. “Never get behind ... old people,” he says, pointing to a gently pottering, elderly couple. “They never seem to appreciate how little time they have left on earth.” Then he gestures to several travellers of Middle Eastern appearance and adds. “Five words: randomly selected for additional screening.” He is, of course, exploiting for his convenience the reality of the post-911 era (“I’m like my mother,” he says. “I stereotype. It’s faster.”) Today there is a new reality. But ethnic typing is still an issue. Since the outset of the pandemic, there have been repeated calls (from myself, among countless others) for greater testing, faster tracing, all in the service of the magic ingredient of modern times: data.Data, we all argued, would allow us to respond swiftly to new Covid-19 outbreaks, replacing the carpet bombing of national measures with the precision weapons of highly-localised lockdowns, and hopefully rendering such lockdowns – confusing, contradictory –  unnecessary. Not so fast. The data is now pointing out the risk that several generations of a single family pose by coming together inside a single house, just as many British Muslims do to celebrate Eid. Muslims who travelled across the country to see relatives for the first time in months were told on the equivalent of December 24 that Christmas had been cancelled. Some were and are rightly cheesed off about the last-minute nature of the announcement. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, shows every sign of being cheesed off himself, blaming household gatherings and the failure to respect social distancing guidelines as the cause of new outbreaks. Everyone wants to point the finger. But at whom? My beloved data, it turns out, is far from complete, far from perfect, still capable of multiple interpretations. The ONS, for example, knows enough that there is a rise in cases, but not enough to know which parts of the country they might affect.  Like the introduction of video refereeing in football, what was intended to help shed clear unarguable light can in fact spark more vicious argument than ever. Which is not to demand the hunt for information be cancelled, but to serve as a reminder that the Covid road to supposed perfect, data-driven decision-making will be littered with accidents – more pernicious than ever because we will blame the victims not on our biases but on “the numbers”.None of this will need explaining to the Prime Minister. Boris Johnson runs a Downing Street addicted to data, where endless polls augment his own uncanny ability to judge the twists, turns, and, yes, biases, of public mood. His instinct twinned with focus group insight is a mighty political partnership.Normally, however, Mr Johnson revels in at least pretending to side with that instinct against the information. With the people against the experts. With his live-and-let-live inclinations against the dogmatists.Yet at the lectern yesterday, as so often throughout this pandemic, he was forced to play the role he hates – siding with the experts against the people, rather than with the people against the experts. Reimposing restrictions, delaying easing, for all that he may protest the reverse, feels like a return to lockdown. He will know the public and political impact: can’t he get a grip? The irony is that this wound, for such a master of communication, is largely self-inflicted. For what we are going through now is, short of a vaccine or a major weakening of the virus, inevitable. And how we perceive this experience is largely about how it is framed.   The right messaging requires two things: first, that we stop comparing this pandemic to the Spanish Flu. Let us not imagine that, as a century ago, second and third waves equal to or worse than the first are inevitably rolling toward us. But when the PM talks of “a second wave in Europe” that is the fear he evokes. Second, it is pointless to pretend that we can hold our collective breath until a vaccine appears. A vaccine may or may not appear. If it does, it could come this year, but it could be next year, or never. We don’t know.  When you have those two points in mind, you don’t step up to the dais, grim faced, as if to announce some national tragedy, every time there is a spike in cases. What you do is say, “This is life with the virus, it is not going away anytime soon, and with every day that it reveals more about itself, we learn to live with it better, hone and tailor our response – and thrive.”The reality is that earlier this year, when Covid-19 was largely out of control, the total number of cases doubled every few days. Even at current, growing rates, the total would double every few months. There is no comparison. There is no tsunami just about to crash over our shores. Rather there is an uptick which we must be vigilant about and nimble enough to crush before taking further steps towards adapted normality. Somehow, however, the man elected to give us our mojo back, the man who sells himself as the electorate’s dauntless companion through the vicissitudes of life, who sees the bright side and can plot his way there when others spy only a thick covering of grey clouds, has now got himself bogged down in the minutiae of whether casinos can reopen on August 1 or August 15, all while wearing the expression of a punter who has bet his house on the next spin of the wheel.As Chris Whitty noted, we have a certain room for manoeuvre and are currently at the limit of that. Mandatory masks and a renewed focus on social distancing may buy us some more room. Young people, so often left out of the political calculus, may justly require more attention, a little bribe here and there, to secure their cooperation. Yet circumstances will not remain fixed. We will find ways of expanding Whitty’s margin of action, of doing more and more, fortunes ever improving, with the hope of a sudden dramatic victory in the form of a vaccine always possible. We have talked so often of the Blitz Spirit. And while the war, like the Spanish Flu, is not always a useful comparison, it is worth remembering that the Blitz lasted eight months and was followed by four more years of conflict. Bowling-alley Boris should leave the gloomy nitty-gritty to others, and find a way to prepare us for that longer journey. The best way of doing so is to point out that, as with data, we are just beginning to deploy our countermeasures, just beginning to change our lives, potentially for the better. Despite huge strides, the room for improvement is infinite. The incentive to innovate vast. It is scary. But the old Boris would somehow convince us that it was exciting too.

The concept needs revisiting,” his paper says.“If safe and effective vaccines and life-saving preventative and therapeutic medications are not found, lengthy lockdowns prove impossible, and the pandemic does not disappear spontaneously, population immunity is the only, long-term solution.”Prof Bhopal, who has advised the Government on public health issues, said that the 40-50 per cent infection rate that is needed to achieve herd immunity could be reached by allowing Covid-19 to spread among young and healthy people.“Allowing infection in those at very low risk while making it safer for them and wider society needs consideration but is currently taboo,” his paper says. Prof Bhopal told The Daily : Why do we not like herd immunity? Discussion of it has been closed down because people equate it with letting the pandemic rip through a population without any control measures at all. I am completely against that, it would be insane. I am not advocating that we dispense with all control measures, we still need to wash our hands, keep our distance and do everything we are being advised to. The bottom line is that older people have got a lot to gain from lockdowns and a lot to lose from the infection. Young people have a lot to lose from lockdowns and not much to lose from the infection.Our efforts should be directed towards protecting people who are at high risk. The concept of herd immunity prompted a backlash when it was first mentioned by the UK\u0027s Chief Scientific Adviser in March.Sir Patrick Vallance said at the time that a degree of herd immunity will help the UK population as Covid-19 spreads.He explained that the aim was to reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely.Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission.  Around 60 per cent of Britain\u0027s population would need to contract coronavirus in order for herd immunity to stave off the disease in future, he added.However, the Government quickly moved to distance itself from his remarks with the health secretary Matt Hancock insisting that herd immunity is a “scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy”.  Earlier this month, an Oxford University study suggested that the UK may have already achieved a sufficient level of herd immunity to stop a second wave of coronavirus.Scientists said that the threshold of herd immunity may have been lowered because many people may already be immune to the disease without ever having caught it.According to a new model produced by an Oxford University team led by Professor Sunetra Gupta, as little as 20 per cent of the population may need to be resistant to the virus in order to prevent a new epidemic spreading.However, Sussex University researchers have warned that predictions that herd immunity can be reached when fewer than 40 per cent of the population have been infected are “optimistic” and cannot be relied on.Professor Istvan Kiss from the university’s School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences said that such predictions could lull people into a “false sense of security” at a time when Covid-19 still poses a “great risk” to society.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe

egg has turned head","story":"Learning how to swim properly and how best to reach your destination quickly and efficiently are key lessons in life.After all, conception itself relies on human sperm mastering both these tasks from the word go.But our idea of quite how they manage to swim towards their goal has just been turned on its head.It used to be thought that sperm used their tails to propel themselves forwards in a snakelike movement, much like eels in water.However, a pioneering 3D study has now revealed they in fact rotate like a spinning top or corkscrew as they wriggle through semen and vaginal fluids.This unique action enables sperm to move towards an egg with maximum efficiency and its discovery could lead to better fertility treatment and help more couples achieve their dream of parenthood.Previous notions of how sperm reached their goal were the result of an optical illusion created by 2D microscopes and originate in the discoveries of the lensmaker Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1677.The Dutch scientist, regarded as the “father of microbiology”, was the first person to observe sperm cells under a microscope.But his theories have now been upended by researchers from the University of Bristol and the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who, using state of the art microscopy, reconstructed the true movement of sperm in astonishing detail.The team used a high-speed camera that records over 55,000 frames a second, and a piezoelectric scanner that generates its own energy through touch, to move the sample of sperm up and down at a high speed, so that it could be watched swimming freely in 3D.Lead author Dr Hermes Gadelha, from the University of Bristol, said: “The sperms’ rapid and highly synchronised spinning causes an illusion when seen from above with 2D microscopes.“The tail appears to have a side-to-side symmetric movement, ‘like eels in water’, as described by Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century.“However, our discovery shows sperm have developed a swimming technique to compensate for their lop-sidedness and in doing so have ingeniously solved a mathematical puzzle at a microscopic scale – by creating symmetry out of asymmetry.“Human sperm figured out if they roll as they swim, much like playful otters corkscrewing through water, their one-sided stroke would average itself out, and they would swim forwards.“The otter-like spinning of human sperm is however complex – the sperm head spins at the same time that the sperm tail rotates around the swimming direction.“This is known in physics as precession, much like when the orbits of Earth and Mars precess around the sun.”Computer-assisted semen analysis systems in use today in clinics and research still rely on 2D views to observe the movement of sperm. They are therefore prone, like Leeuwenhoek\u0027s first microscope, to the illusion of symmetry.Better understanding of a sperm’s true movement, detailed in a study published in Science Advances, may provide fresh hope for couples struggling to conceive by helping clinicians pinpoint defective or weak specimens.Dr Gadelha said: “With over half of infertility caused by male factors, understanding the human sperm tail is fundamental to developing future diagnostic tools to identify unhealthy sperm.”Infertility affects an estimated one in seven British couples – and rates are rising. Environmental factors have been blamed, with heat, chemicals and toxins thought to cause a deterioration in the quality of sperm.The study’s co-author Dr Alberto Darszon, of the the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said: “This discovery will revolutionise our understanding of sperm motility and its impact on natural fertilisation.“So little is known about the intricate environment inside the female reproductive tract and how sperm swimming impinge on fertilisation. These new tools open our eyes to the amazing capabilities sperm have.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"liberals happy associated nicola sturgeons brand nationalism","story":"How do the Scots Nationalists get away with it? In every other country on earth the addition of the word “nationalists” to a political party’s name makes self-described “liberals” shudder. Even many conservatives are wary of the connotations that the term brings.Yet among all the nationalist parties and movements, only the Scots nationalists are given a pass by the respectable and media classes. And this is curious because Scots nationalism is no different from any other type of nationalism. In fact, it is worse than most. Its sole motivating factor is anti-Englishness. Its leaders will speak well of any country in the world (Cuba, Iran, France) just so long as they can portray the English and the dreaded “Westminster” in the worst possible light.Of course they have pulled this off in recent years by portraying themselves as “progressive”. No right-on cause can appear without the SNP putting its fumbling, fat hands around it. From there the contradictions pile up without consequence. At present the SNP is an avowedly green party whose sole honeypot is (it believes) North Sea oil. It is a “pro-ersity” party that welcomes people of all creeds and colours. Except the English.In power it has presided over failure after failure in every sector in which it has any control. It has been responsible for a decline in Scotland’s once-great education system, an increase in waiting times in the healthcare system and a failure of Scottish care-homes (even before Covid) on a fatal and tragic scale.Still the polls show steady support for the party. And since the last “once in a lifetime” referendum, support for the idea of an independent country that would be perpetually governed by these numpties has actually risen. If a referendum happened today, Scotland might sail off to join sub-Saharan Africa in the ranks of the world poverty indexes.Unionists are right to be worried about this. Not least because nothing we say has any effect, as the recently departed leader of the Scottish Tories, Jackson Carlaw, discovered. Personally I find the idea of a second “once in a lifetime” referendum ridiculous. But if it ever did happen, it should only take place with the consequences of a “yes” vote fully agreed upon.Next time, let the voters know exactly what would happen to their currency, international alliances and security arrangements. Above all let it be agreed what share of the national debt they would be forced to take on. Only once these things are agreed upon should any vote even be considered. Which is one way – of course – of ensuring that it never happens at all.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/01/14/best-movie-twists.jpg","title":"best movie twists film endings spiderman saw sixth sense netflix","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.We count down the most memorable rug-pulls in cinema historyBeing caught off guard by a well-deployed twist is an unrivalled cinematic joy.Over the years, writers and directors have imagined up fresh ways of keeping film audiences on their toes. Some remain astonishingly bold by today’s standards, while others have had the gleam worn off by the film’s they’ve gone onto inspire.There are those filmmakers who have attempted to make the twist their trademark (see: M Night Shyamalan, whose 1999 release The Sixth Sense turns 20 this week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThen there are those who have impressively shaped a film around its rug-pulling denouement (Christopher Nolan’s magician drama The Prestige was essentially one giant magic trick). Either way, they make for memorable viewing.37 sequels that are even better than the originalIntriguingly, twists are mostly prevalent in horror films, which is what makes it so breathtaking when they show up mid-way through a drama – or, even rarer, a comedy. We’ve compiled what we believe to be 37 of the greatest twists in cinema history.Click through the gallery below to see what has made the cut. Naturally, spoilers abound – and don’t go ruining the surprise for those who haven’t seen any of these films.Created with Sketch.The most shocking film twists of all time Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBanks and mortgage brokers have signalled that these homeowners are likely to find it harder to remortgage, meaning they may not be able to take advantage of an eight-month suspension of stamp duty for homes under £500,000 announced last month.The government told borrowers back in March, when it announced that banks would be offering repayment holidays, that their credit files would not be affected if they paused their mortgages to ease pressure on stretched finances.What now for your post-payment holiday mortgage?Some 1.9 million households took up the offer, meaning that payments were deferred in about one in six of the UK’s 11 million residential mortgages.But ministers failed to warn people that obtaining credit or switching mortgage providers could be made more difficult, because lenders take other factors beyond the credit file into account when approving a loan.With an average of 50,000 borrowers remortgaging each month, tens of thousands could find it more difficult to find a new deal over the next year when they look to switch, said Sarah Coles, personal finance advisor at Hargreaves Lansdown.It could technically be as high as “100,000, but I think, in reality, it’s more likely to be tens of thousands of people affected,” she said.These figures, she stressed, were based on the extent to which the pandemic “puts a stop to remortgaging”, adding: “It looks like it’s going to have a really big impact.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA payment holiday could make borrowers “much less attractive to lend to”, narrowing their options significantly, Ms Coles warned.“Banks are worried that official credit ratings aren’t going to give them the full picture of people’s finances. Payment holidays are not allowed to be included on a credit file, so lenders can then look at your payment record and see that you’ve got a gap.”She added: ”When your options for mortgage products shrink, you are bound to have to spend a lot more money.”Homeowners should only apply for a three-month extension to a payment holiday if absolutely necessary, said Ms Cole.“It’s really a particular concern if someone is thinking of extending a repayment holiday then, it’s really important to think about the consequences.”Brokers have warned that they are also seeing it become harder for some borrowers to remortgage as lenders tighten up their criteria in response to mounting concerns about the economy, jobs and a potential knock-on effect on house prices.Taking a payment holiday is one factor they will consider, said Miles Robinson, head of mortgages at broker Trussle.Households have taken a mortgage repayment holiday“My advice from the start has been to see a payment holiday as a last resort. If you can pay your mortgage, pay it.“If you stopped paying, get back on it unless you are really in financial difficulty. It shouldn’t be seen as a way to just have a bit more money and buy some nice garden furniture it does have an impact.” A mortgage holiday that a customer did not really need to take may be tricky to explain to a lender in future, he said.Days after the government announced in March that mortgage holidays would be widely available, banks had sounded a warning about the impact on customers. Lenders feared that the pitfalls were not made sufficiently clear to borrowers, who may be saddled with extra costs when they remortgage, take out a loan or apply for a credit card.Yet it took until the end of May for the regulator to update its guidance to reflect the true impact. By that stage, 1.2 million people had already applied for a mortgage payment holiday. The Financial Conduct Authority quietly changed the wording on its advice page to state that a holiday “could impact future lending decisions”.Pat McFadden, shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, told The Independent: “People should not be penalised for taking up support which has been put in place because of necessary public health measures. “This was intended to help people through an unprecedented crisis and it should not damage their credit rating. The FCA should ensure no one is penalised in this way.“While people who do not need a payment holiday are advised to continue paying their mortgage in full, debt advisors encouraged people who are in genuine financial difficulty not to be put off taking a break.“As a debt adviser I am worried that people whose finances have been badly affected by coronavirus may be put off asking for a payment break they do need by worries about getting credit in future which may be groundless,” said Sara Williams, who runs Debt Camel, an advice website. “It is a bad idea to stretch to pay debts and end up getting behind with essential bills if you are then so short of money.”A number of brokers said the exact impact on people’s future credit was highly uncertain at present, with different lenders taking very different approaches.Larger high street banks and building societies tend to rely more heavily on algorithms to make decisions than smaller rivals, said Alex Winn, a mortgage broker at Habito. These systems may exclude applicants on the basis of fixed criteria such as a gap in payments.“Unfortunately, it’s case by case and lender by lender at the moment. We just don’t know,” he said.“There will certainly be a lot more questions from lenders for customers who’ve taken a repayment holiday. We hope that they will take a sensible view.”Lenders rely on credit reference agencies such as Experian or Equifax to compile a credit score but take into account a host of other indicators, including whether payments have not been made on a mortgage, loan or card.It is up to the lender how they make their decision based on that data, but many are undoubtedly becoming stricter with their criteria.“I think the banks will be aware of people potentially being auto-excluded and will be doing a lot of work in the background to ensure it isn’t a problem,” said Mr Robinson at Trussle. “People who are currently taking a mortgage repayment holiday may struggle to get a loan, as it is a sign that they are under financial strain,” he said.But after a few months of regular income, any problems are likely to be reduced.“Lenders focus on what is affordable to you in your current circumstances,” Mr Robinson said.Banks outlined differing approaches to customers who have taken mortgage payment holidays.Nationwide said it would not report payment holidays to credit reference agencies as arrears, but added that it took a range of factors into account and assessed applications “on a case-by-case basis”.Barclays said that taking an approved payment holiday with another lender would not affect chances of remortgaging with the bank.A spokesperson for Santander said all customers would be assessed on the same borrowing criteria, regardless of whether they had taken a repayment holiday.“As part of this criteria, and to ensure we’re lending responsibly, we’ll assess the customers’ ability to repay their credit, based on their current financial position,” they said. “This will include a review of their outstanding secured and unsecured debt, income and expenditure.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The prime minister on Friday announced casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close-contact services must remain closed, while indoor performances and pilots of larger crowds in sports venues will not take place. Plans to allow wedding receptions of up to 30 people were also postponed. He also announced face coverings will be mandatory in more indoor settings, including museums, cinemas and places of worship from 8 August, and shielding has been paused for the clinically vulnerable in England and Scotland from Saturday. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt comes after tougher measures were introduced in parts of Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and east Lancashire in northern England, banning people from different households meeting indoors or in gardens following a spike in virus cases.FA cup final to go ahead without fansGyms and pubs \u0027must close again to get England close to zero Covid\u0027Pubs may have to close for schools to reopen, says expertWhat are the latest changes to England\u0027s lockdown restrictions?Shielding ends for clinically vulnerableFrance starts testing travellers from 16 nationsTravellers entering France from 16 countries where the coronavirus is circulating widely must now undergo virus tests upon arrival at French airports and ports.French prime minister Jean Castex announced last month that the tests would be required starting 1 August for passengers France is allowing in from a list of approved countries unless they present proof of a negative test done within 72 hours of their departure.Those who test positive in France as of Saturday must quarantine for 14 days.France is not permitting general travel to and from the 16 countries, which include the United States and Brazil.The testing requirement therefore only applies to people entering under limited circumstances: French citizens who live in these countries or citizens of these countries with an established residence in France.French health authorities say the number of daily confirmed Covid-19 cases has jumped on the French mainland in recent weeks. The government has already made mask-wearing mandatory in all indoor public spaces.Four more people die with coronavirus in hospital in EnglandA further four people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,342, NHS England said.Patients were aged between 78 and 84 years old and all had known underlying health conditions.\u0026nbspAnother five deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result.Scotland records 18 new casesA total of 18 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland in the past 24 hours.The figures come as shielding rules put in place to protect 180,000 Scots most vulnerable to the disease are paused.The 18 positive cases represent 0.5 per cent\u0026nbspof all newly tested iniduals, the Scottish government said.No new deaths have been recorded among people who tested positive for the virus, meaning the total under this measurement remains at 2,491.It has now been 16 days since someone died in Scotland after a positive test for coronavirus.Scotland\u0027s national clinical director Jason Leitch urged people to help those no longer shielding to feel safe.Tiny Italian island out of room to quarantine arriving refugeesSeveral small boats filled with more Tunisian refugees\u0026nbsphave reached a tiny Italian island that has run out of room to quarantine them as required by Italy\u0027s anti-coronavirus measures, local officials have said.\u0026nbspSicilian daily newspaper Giornale di Sicilia quoted Lampedusa mayor Toto\u0026nbspMartello as saying the island can\u0027t wait until the government sends a chartered ferry where the migrants can be held for 14 days to fulfill the country\u0027s quarantine requirement.\u0026nbspLampedusa\u0027s migrant holding centre was built for a maximum capacity of 95 people and was already holding 950 when the latest passengers arrived, Mr Martello said.The 250 who arrived between Friday night and Saturday must stay on the dock for now, until the promised ferry arrives or some other solution is found.\u0026nbspSeven boats directly reached Lampedusa\u0027s shores, while an eighth boat needed assistance as it approached the island,after setting off from Tunisia\u0027s Mediterranean coast.\u0026nbspThe mayor said a total of 250 boats carrying 5,000 migrants in all have reached the island in a month. Many of the passengers were transferred to migrant residences on Sicily on commercial ferries or other vessels.Arriving migrants were linked to several dozen recent coronavirus clusters. Concern is growing among health authorities that Italy\u0027s number of new confirmed cases, which had been largely contained by June, could again start surging out of control.Vietnam says up to 800,000 have left virus epicentreVietnam\u0027s health ministry has revealed\u0026nbspup to 800,000 visitors to Danang city, the country\u0027s new novel coronavirus epicentre, have left for other parts of the country since 1 July.Vietnam last week detected its first locally transmitted Covid-19 cases in more than three months in Danang, a tourism hot spot.The total number of infections in the country has since risen by 40 to 586 today, with most of the new cases linked to three hospitals in Danang.More than 41,000 people have visited the three hospitals since 1 July, the ministry said in a statement.The Southeast Asian country reported its first two Covid-19 deaths on Friday, and the toll rose to three today.Elderly church leader arrested amid spate of infectionsThe elderly leader of a\u0026nbsp​secretive religious sect in South Korea has been arrested\u0026nbspamid\u0026nbspallegations a\u0026nbspchurch hampered the government\u0027s anti-virus response after thousands of worshippers were infected in February and March.Prosecutors in the central city of Suwaon have been questioning 88-year-old Lee Man-hee, chairman of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, over charges that the church hid some members and under-reported gatherings to avoid broader quarantines.The Suwon District Court granted prosecutors\u0027 request to arrest Mr Lee over concerns that he could tamper with evidence.Mr Lee and his church have steadfastly denied the accusations, saying they are cooperating with health authorities.Kim Young-eun, speaking for the church, said it will do its best so that the truth is clearly proved in court.More than 5,200 of the South Korea\u0027s 14,336 Covid-19 cases have been linked to the church so far.Its branch in the southern city of Daegu emerged as the biggest cluster after infections spiked in late February.APUkraine\u0027s Covid-19 death toll could reach 4,000, health officials sayHealth officials in Ukraine said a spike in cases this week\u0026nbspcould cause the nation\u0027s death toll to reach 4,000, more than double the current fatalities, according to Interfax Ukraine news agency.Ukraine reported a record high of 1,197 new coronavirus cases on 29 July\u0026nbspand a record number of hospital admissions, with health authorities blaming the jump on wider use of public transport and attendance at church services.Deputy health minister Viktor Lyashko said preventative measures were the only way to contain the spread of the virus.Ukrainians still have to wear face masks and adhere to social distancing rules in restaurants and public places, although the government said last week that it will allow inidual regions to ease restrictions if warranted.The country TODAY reported 1,172 new coronavirus cases versus 1,090 a day earlier.Ukraine\u0026nbspnow has 71,056 cases of the virus, including 1,709 deaths.Mr Lyashko said the total number of cases could reach 400,000 during the course of the epidemic.Anti-lockdown protesters proclaim freedom day in Berlin\u0026nbsp(Christoph Soederdpa via AP)Protesters against coronavirus restrictions have gathered in Berlin for a demonstration titled The End Of The Pandemic - Freedom Day.It comes amid increasing concern about an upturn in infections in Germany.A crowd of people whistling and cheering, and with few masks in sight, marched from the Brandenburg Gate on Saturday ahead of a rally on a wide boulevard that runs through the city\u0027s Tiergarten park.Protesters held up homemade placards featuring slogans that included Corona, false alarm, We are being forced to wear a muzzle and Natural defence instead of vaccination.Some chanted: We\u0027re here and we\u0027re loud, because we are being robbed of our freedom.People came from various parts of Germany for Saturday\u0027s protest.Germany\u0027s management of the pandemic has widely been viewed as relatively successful, with a lower death rate than comparable countries.AP\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In art and culture, that value only emerges when there is a relation between the cultural object and people. So if an object is unused, unavailable, it has no such value. Therefore it is not a monument.”According to reports, the scene featuring the proposed bridge explosion will be set in Switzerland, where it was originally scheduled to be filmed. However, plans were changed after the Swiss government refused.The news ided social media users, with some condemning the crew’s plans and others struggling to see an issue.One person wrote: “How sky high does your ego have to be to think that your film is more important than a historical monument that can’t be replaced? Just use CGI to replicate, like literally every other film does when they need an explosive set piece at a historical location.”In response, another added: “Things get blown up. It’s cool. And it’s not a monument. It’s a basic bridge. Not even that old.”Production on Mission: Impossible 7, which will be directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is set to resume in the UK in September, before heading to Poland in April.The film will be released in November 2022.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.2030 11. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? Adam Sandler blazes like a diamond-drill in Josh and Benny Safdie’s sensory-rush drama about a jeweller and gambling addict trying to hold onto his sanity as his world comes crashing down. It’s an exhausting, sometimes overwhelming watch – but with Sandler as the audience’s lodestar, it’s a journey worth staying with.Noah Baumbach draws on the breakdown of his marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh in this unflinching chronicling of a modern orce. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are compelling as a couple who wake one morning to discover they’ve fallen out of love, while Laura Dern deservedly won an Oscar as Johansson’s force-of-nature attorney.2730 4. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2830 3. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. Teaming up with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese suggested The Irishman might be the cinematic event of the decade. There is certainly lots to love in this generations-ning tale of hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and his own daughter (Anna Paquin). True, the film isn’t quite a classic at the level of Goodfellas. The de-aging technology employed to turn the cast into thirtysomething gangsters feels rubbery and unconvincing. And the 209-minute running time left many viewers suffering numb bum. But it’s still Scorsese doing mobsters and unmistakably the work of a director reaching for a big artistic statement.The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  130 30. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland.

But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix.

Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day.

A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Parliament’s spending watchdog is to launch a crackdown on business class flights after MPs spent hundreds of pounds travelling in style to European destinations over the past three years.  In future, MPs will have to provide evidence their journey did not cost any more than a standard ticket booked at the same time.The guidance will come into force later this year, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBefore 2017, MPs could make a maximum of just three European journeys a year, either to national parliaments or European Union institutions.But that year the rules were relaxed to remove the cap. Full scale of Tory MP’s expense abuse unveiled by whistleblowerTrips were also permitted to any destination in Europe, as long as the purpose of the visit was parliamentary. But a recent analysis of expenses claims by IPSA shows MPs spent £1,944 on business class air travel to Europe over the past three years. IPSA, which was set up in the wake of the expenses scandal in 2009, said it did not have evidence to show “whether these flights were within the rules, as we do not know what the cost of a standard class ticket would have been”.However, IPSA has chosen not to try to reclaim any of the money, saying it was unable to retrospectively check prices. The watchdog also found that the information submitted by many MPs did not allow it to ascertain the purpose of European travel claims. An IPSA spokesperson said: “IPSA plans to update the evidence requirements later this year to help ensure good value for money. This will apply to European and domestic flights”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new reforms come just months after IPSA clamped down on the use of parliamentary credit cards. John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “IPSA are right to introduce more transparency and controls into MP’s airfares.“Taxpayers get fed up with paying for politicians’ expensive flights, so these changes will give welcome clarity on any possible justification for flying business class – or simply see costs come down.”  Earlier this year, IPSA announced that MPs would face tougher sanctions for misusing taxpayer-funded credit cards. It followed the revelation that 377 MPs, including nine cabinet ministers, had had their official credit cards suspended for breaking the rules on expenses since 2015.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBanks and mortgage brokers have signalled that these homeowners are likely to find it harder to remortgage, meaning they may not be able to take advantage of an eight-month suspension of stamp duty for homes under £500,000 announced last month.The government told borrowers back in March, when it announced that banks would be offering repayment holidays, that their credit files would not be affected if they paused their mortgages to ease pressure on stretched finances.What now for your post-payment holiday mortgage?Some 1.9 million households took up the offer, meaning that payments were deferred in about one in six of the UK’s 11 million residential mortgages.But ministers failed to warn people that obtaining credit or switching mortgage providers could be made more difficult, because lenders take other factors beyond the credit file into account when approving a loan.With an average of 50,000 borrowers remortgaging each month, tens of thousands could find it more difficult to find a new deal over the next year when they look to switch, said Sarah Coles, personal finance advisor at Hargreaves Lansdown.It could technically be as high as “100,000, but I think, in reality, it’s more likely to be tens of thousands of people affected,” she said.These figures, she stressed, were based on the extent to which the pandemic “puts a stop to remortgaging”, adding: “It looks like it’s going to have a really big impact.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA payment holiday could make borrowers “much less attractive to lend to”, narrowing their options significantly, Ms Coles warned.“Banks are worried that official credit ratings aren’t going to give them the full picture of people’s finances. Payment holidays are not allowed to be included on a credit file, so lenders can then look at your payment record and see that you’ve got a gap.”She added: ”When your options for mortgage products shrink, you are bound to have to spend a lot more money.”Homeowners should only apply for a three-month extension to a payment holiday if absolutely necessary, said Ms Cole.“It’s really a particular concern if someone is thinking of extending a repayment holiday then, it’s really important to think about the consequences.”Brokers have warned that they are also seeing it become harder for some borrowers to remortgage as lenders tighten up their criteria in response to mounting concerns about the economy, jobs and a potential knock-on effect on house prices.Taking a payment holiday is one factor they will consider, said Miles Robinson, head of mortgages at broker Trussle.Households have taken a mortgage repayment holiday“My advice from the start has been to see a payment holiday as a last resort. If you can pay your mortgage, pay it.“If you stopped paying, get back on it unless you are really in financial difficulty. It shouldn’t be seen as a way to just have a bit more money and buy some nice garden furniture it does have an impact.” A mortgage holiday that a customer did not really need to take may be tricky to explain to a lender in future, he said.Days after the government announced in March that mortgage holidays would be widely available, banks had sounded a warning about the impact on customers. Lenders feared that the pitfalls were not made sufficiently clear to borrowers, who may be saddled with extra costs when they remortgage, take out a loan or apply for a credit card.Yet it took until the end of May for the regulator to update its guidance to reflect the true impact. By that stage, 1.2 million people had already applied for a mortgage payment holiday. The Financial Conduct Authority quietly changed the wording on its advice page to state that a holiday “could impact future lending decisions”.Pat McFadden, shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, told The Independent: “People should not be penalised for taking up support which has been put in place because of necessary public health measures. “This was intended to help people through an unprecedented crisis and it should not damage their credit rating. The FCA should ensure no one is penalised in this way.“While people who do not need a payment holiday are advised to continue paying their mortgage in full, debt advisors encouraged people who are in genuine financial difficulty not to be put off taking a break.“As a debt adviser I am worried that people whose finances have been badly affected by coronavirus may be put off asking for a payment break they do need by worries about getting credit in future which may be groundless,” said Sara Williams, who runs Debt Camel, an advice website. “It is a bad idea to stretch to pay debts and end up getting behind with essential bills if you are then so short of money.”A number of brokers said the exact impact on people’s future credit was highly uncertain at present, with different lenders taking very different approaches.Larger high street banks and building societies tend to rely more heavily on algorithms to make decisions than smaller rivals, said Alex Winn, a mortgage broker at Habito. These systems may exclude applicants on the basis of fixed criteria such as a gap in payments.“Unfortunately, it’s case by case and lender by lender at the moment. We just don’t know,” he said.“There will certainly be a lot more questions from lenders for customers who’ve taken a repayment holiday. We hope that they will take a sensible view.”Lenders rely on credit reference agencies such as Experian or Equifax to compile a credit score but take into account a host of other indicators, including whether payments have not been made on a mortgage, loan or card.It is up to the lender how they make their decision based on that data, but many are undoubtedly becoming stricter with their criteria.“I think the banks will be aware of people potentially being auto-excluded and will be doing a lot of work in the background to ensure it isn’t a problem,” said Mr Robinson at Trussle. “People who are currently taking a mortgage repayment holiday may struggle to get a loan, as it is a sign that they are under financial strain,” he said.But after a few months of regular income, any problems are likely to be reduced.“Lenders focus on what is affordable to you in your current circumstances,” Mr Robinson said.Banks outlined differing approaches to customers who have taken mortgage payment holidays.Nationwide said it would not report payment holidays to credit reference agencies as arrears, but added that it took a range of factors into account and assessed applications “on a case-by-case basis”.Barclays said that taking an approved payment holiday with another lender would not affect chances of remortgaging with the bank.A spokesperson for Santander said all customers would be assessed on the same borrowing criteria, regardless of whether they had taken a repayment holiday.“As part of this criteria, and to ensure we’re lending responsibly, we’ll assess the customers’ ability to repay their credit, based on their current financial position,” they said. “This will include a review of their outstanding secured and unsecured debt, income and expenditure.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged. He turns  in November and his fiancée Emma Krokdal is .We shrug this off because a he’s a bloke, b age is just a number and c what is  years between two lovers Except when I was questioned ahead of my appearance on Celeb First Dates Hotel last year about what age range I would consider for a partner, without a pause I said: “Twenty-five to .” My daughters were HORRIFIED.I’m nearly  and the idea of an older woman with a far younger man is deemed unthinkable and distasteful. Yet a handsome man marrying an adolescent girl is much more palatable.Well, I’m not having it. Don’t you dare give me the side eye when I walk with my future -year-old beau! OK, a girl’s gotta dream.A ROBUST, toned, muscled, strapping, athletic, sturdy, brawny, vigorous, rippedman has been parading up and down Oxford Street in London in his birthday suit with his plumbing shielded only by a feeble face mask. He’s making a point.I was wonderinghe’d like to come and make that point in my town.Because I also think I need to adjust his mask a little.Just want to be helpful.FIRST Dates TV maitre d’ Fred Sirieix is hopelessly in love with his fiancée and has revealed he is having the best sex of his le at . He puts it all down to the fact he has a greater overall wisdom at his age and that he likes himself more than when he was in his twenties.As a mature woman who recently had to kickstart her sex engine after some barren years, I agree there is much truth to feeling a bit wiser with age.Butwe’re really honest, it probably has nothing to do with our maturity and all to do with the connection you make and the person you’re with.It’s nothing you can find on an app, on paper or via social media.It’s just there when you meet. And it takes your breath away.SWEDEN didn’t go into lockdown, preferring instead to keep the economy going with its obedient citizens.The Swedes have been pleased by the way their government have tackled the pandemic, so much so that a solid minority has decided to get tattoos of the chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. Not a bad-looking chap either.I was booked in for another inking just as we went into lockdown.But as tattooists have opened up again, I’m thinking a little Prof Chris Whitty on my left shoulder or buttock.Thoughts, please.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From the start, Kate was horried at the way Meghan spoke to staff members at Kensington Palace and it was clear they would never click in the way Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson had once done.The now infamous tiara row, which I first revealed in November , was the culmination of many fallouts before the wedding.Afterwards, William and the Queen’s dresser and closest confidante, Angela Kelly, were united in their decision not to loan Meghan items from the Royal Collection, which included tiaras worn by Diana.As I began to report these stories, it is true to say Harry and Meghan became suspicious of their own staff, incorrectly believing they had been somehow hijacked by dark forces, the so-called “men in grey suits”, at Buckingham Palace.That categorisation is too simplistic.Who are these men  They may have existed in , but the senior figures in key roles behind the scenes within the Royal Family tend to be thoroughly modern members of the metropolitan elite these days.While it is correct to say they encouraged the couple to follow more conventional processes in terms of their dealings with other royal households and the Press, the real-le Sussex Squad was doggedly committed to the couple’s principles and goals.For example, their communications chief Sara Latham — blamed by Meghan for any negative stories in British newspapers — was a highly successful opera- tor who had worked for Hillary Clinton.She was prepared to pack up her le in London and move to Africa with the couple perman- ently to help achieve their humanitarian goals.Much official time and energy was put into the South African relocation planonly for the couple to eventually brand it too dficult.Instead, Harry and Meghan foolishly began to rely almost entirely on advice provided by a small team of fiercely loyal Hollywood advisers.I managed to unpick details of this secret cabal throughout the latter half of last year, but they had been causing major headaches for Buckingham Palace long before that.The group — attorney Rick Genow, business manager Andrew Meyer and talent agent Nick Collins — are typical Hollywood “Yes” people.Just as important were her PR advisers from the controversial crisis management firm Sunshine Sachs, specically Shawn Sachs and Keleigh Thomas Morgan.They had all become close with Meghan while she was a moderate star on the cable TV legal drama Suits, an era when she was so desperate for coverage in magazines she would even set up shots with paparazzi photog- raphers.She kept the Hollywood crew largely on the sidelines during the early days of her courtship with Harry. But as tensions with royal courtiers increased, so too did Meghan’s contact with them.It was this team who bunkered down with Meghan over Christmas and New Year in Canada, secretly drafting the content for the Sussex Royal website that, when published,like a Hollywood press release than a statement of intent by two senior members of the British Royal Family.Much has been written about how I broke the story of Megxit, with the finger incorrectly being pointed at both Clarence House and Kensington Palace.The couple like to promote the idea that they were somehow ambushed into revealing their plans after we published the world exclusive on January .However, they neglect to mention I had originally put the story to their office ten days earlier and had discussed every aspect of what we eventually published with their officials.It is not a coincidence my first story of the move included details of the Sussexes’ unhappiness about the release of photographs over Christmas featuring the Queen, Charles, William and George.The biography goes further by pointing to the absence of a picture of Harry, Meghan and Archie on the Queen’s table during her annual Christmas Day message.It is inconceivable to me that this wasn’t a purposeful slight by the institution, trying to make a point to Harry and Meghan: “Come back and join the party during events like Christmas or we’ll pretend you don’t exist.”It backfired spectacularly.So can such a toxic relationship be healed There is a growing acknowledgement from both sides that so long as Harry and Meghan’s romantic relationship remains strong, that is highly unlikely.But this book is a spectacular own goal by a couple who like to insist they are opposed to bitchy off-the-record briefings and royal revelations using source quotes slagging off other members of The Firm.Because fundamentally, that’s all Finding Freedom is.Unlike Andrew Morton’s game-changing Diana: Her True Story, there is no revelation that makes you think dferently about what went on.A couple desperate to blame others for their unwise decisions have allowed a fanboy “journalist” to confirm a whole load of newspaper exclusives, which they incidentally denied at the time, but spun with their own, often , narrative.Harry and Meghan are not victims of the media, the establishment or the British public.I will never forget that beautul spring day in May  when the entire country celebrated a royal wedding with the type of hope and joy not seen since July , when Charles and Diana tied the knot.It was one of those rare moments, like the London  Olympics, when we celebrated as one.This couple had the world at their feet — superstardom and influence any film actor or pop star would dream of, but without the cumbersome pressure of the throne hanging over them, like the Cambridges.They had a very real chance to help reinvent and modernise the monarchy from within.What a tragedy they have chosen to focus their energies on settling scores in tawdry tell-alls and unnecessary courtroom battles.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someones home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.The mixup came as England was hit with  new positive cases – the highest number in  days – adding to fears the country is facing a second wave of the virus.But the sudden new rules - which means that people can still go to work and even visit shops and cafes - have left Brits reeling after they were introduced about .pm, barely three hours before they were put into force.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to discuss the matter in his coronavirus press conference today.What the new rules mean:About .million people will be affected by the new lockdown rules - which are expected to be subject to a weekly review.The affected areas include all of the .million residents of Greater Manchester, as well as the Lancashire towns of Blackburn, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale.West Yorkshire, Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees were also hit.Leicester was also included in the households ban, but pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will reopen on Monday.However, leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed.Earlier Mr Hancock has admitted Muslims living in the area will have their Eid celebrations affected.He said: My heart goes out to the Muslim community. I know that this will have a particular impact on Eid celebrations. Weve been working with Imams and religious leaders to ensure that Eid celebrations can go ahead in a co-vid secure way in mosques and there are some really innovative proposals to celebrate in parks where social distancing is easier and theres more space. But it does mean, for everybody, meetings between households wont be possible and of course that has a particular impact when theres a celebration like Eid coming up for the Muslim community. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi today slammed the lack of clarity over the message on Good Morning Britain, saying she had received calls up to am overnight by confused members of the community.She said: “There is still not clarity on whether that means you can meet outdoors, thankfully there is still some clarication that those mosques that had prepared for Covid Eid prayers with the proper procedures would be allowed to go ahead.“People have voluntarily been part of this response and I think it would have been better to do this with a little more understanding and clarity.”Labour leader Keir Starmer said he would not argue with local action to reduce the transmission of the virus but said: Announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis.He added: For all the bluster, government has failed to deliver a ing track and trace system that would spot local flare ups like these.Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said she had been blindsided by the new rules.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning was left trying to defend the move, saying the move had been absolutely necessary.Speaking to Sky News, he said the new rules were crystal clear, saying the test and trace data had shown most of the transmission is happening between households.He added: Everyone can see that the problem with this virus is it thrives on the social contact that makes le worth living.The Health Secretary had last night said he was introducing the new measures with a heavy heart - tweeting the announcement at .pm with details published two hours later before the full guidelines were released this morning.Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said there had been a “marked change” across his boroughs in recent days.Speaking on Good Morning Britain today, he said: The truth of the matter is the pub is a more regulated environment, as is public transport where people are supposed to wear face masks.The home is a less regulated.And he defended the sudden introduction of the new guidelines, saying the virus could move quickly.Lib Dem leader Ed Davey wrote: How this lockdown in Manchester, East Lancs  West Yorks has been introduced is worrying, confusing, frustrating and damaging.No-one doubts these are dficult decisions - but when lives of millions of people are involved, Ministers have a duty to communicate professionally.Others took issue with Wigan being included in the fresh lockdown rules, saying that it had been lumped in with Greater Manchesters rise without recording an increase itself.One local tweeted: Wigan has the lowest rate of cases in Greater Manchester... its not our fault other parts of Manchester are letting the side down.Another added: Wigan has  cases per , and is on lockdown.

Prince Harry’s actress ex Cressida Bonas had secretly tied the knot to beau Harry Wentworth-Stanley in a private country ceremony. The actress previously dated the Duke of Sussex for three years after being introduced by Princess Eugenie, before breaking off their relationship in April  – allegedly after getting spooked by the idea of le as a royal.And while Harry has since quit royal le to get married and move to LA with we Meghan Markle and son Archie, here’s a closer look at what the -year-old’s reported former flames have been up to since.Arguably his most serious relationship before Meghan, Prince Harry was in an on-off relationship with Chelsy Davy, now , for six years from .However, the Zimbabwe-born former law student struggled to cope with the scrutiny that came with dating a royal, telling The Times: “It was so full on: crazy and scary and uncomfortable.” Following their split, the pair maintained a good friendship, with Chelsy even attending Harry’s  wedding. Now, businesswoman Chelsy is a jewellery designer who ides her time between Africa and the UK, and recently revealed she’s started dating someone new.  While a romance was never officially confirmed by either party, presenter Natalie Pinkham, now , and Prince Harry were rumoured to be an item briefly in , and the pair even enjoyed a holiday together in Botswana -–a place he most recently took Meghan. Whether it was a romantic trip or not, the pair remained friends for years – however, Natalie was reportedly ‘ghosted’ by the prince after his  nuptials, with a friend telling The Sun: “When Harry got together with Meghan their relationship rapidly changed – it just went flat and noticeably cooled off.”Now, Natalie continues to work as a F Sky Sports presenter, and is happily married to TV exec husband Owain Walbyoff, who she shares two children with. The pair married in  in Portugal in front of star studded guests including Harry’s cousin, Zara Phillips, and recently celebrated their eighth wedding anniversary. Former lingerie model Cassie Sumner met the prince in  on a night out at Chinawhite nightclub – and went on to reveal details of the one night fling in an interview, claiming he kissed Towie reality star Lauren Pope earlier the same evening. However it wasn’t a serious or long-lasting romance, and Cassie went on to marry footballer Jose Fonte.Now, the couple have two children together.Kate Middleton’s very well connected friend Astrid Harbord – who attended the Duchess’ hen do – and Harry were linked in , after being spotted hanging out together in London. However, while the pair have been pictured at the same events over the years, Harry reportedly ‘cut ties’ with the glam socialite once he started dating Meghan. Now, Astrid is a company director, and founder of Lady Garden, a national women’s health charity encouraging conversation about gynaecological health. When bomb disposal expert Camilla Thurlow joined Love Island in , rumours began to swirl about her  dalliance with Harry – although the now -year-old reality TV star remained tight-lipped on the ITV show. Since then, Camilla’s quest to find true love has paid off, and she remains in one of the few successful Love Island relationships with co-star, model Jamie Jewitt, with the pair recently announcing they’re expecting their first child together.Camilla, who also recently published a book, isn’t the only Love Island star Prince Harry has been linked to. Presenter Caroline Flack, who tragically took her own le earlier this year aged just , had also once been romantically associated to the prince, describing herself as his “bit of rough” after the pair were introduced via mutual friends in .Norwegian rock star Camilla Romestrand – lead singer of band Eddie the Gun – claimed she stayed over at Clarence House and Prince Harry served her breakfast in bed – an account never confirmed by the prince. Now, the Scandinavian beauty is a mum of two with a passion for vegan cooking, and lives predominantly out of the spotlight. Model Florence Brudenell-Bruce, or Flee as she’s known to close friends, had known Harry for a few years before they were linked romantically in , just after his final split from Chelsy. Flee, now , had another high-profile romance when she dated Formula One racing driver Jenson Button until .She went on to marry multi-millionaire Henry St George in , in a romantic ceremony in the south of France, and the couple now have two children.Most recently, she starred in Channel ’s The Great Pottery Throwdown, after revealing shes got into ceramics to overcome post-natal depression. Saturdays pop princess Mollie King, now , bagged herself a few dates with Harry in , and speaking at the time, the singer confessed: “Yes, I have met Harry, and we did go out for a drink.”However, her public profile was dficult to navigate for Harry, and he reportedly called things off.Meanwhile Mollie went on to date supermodel David Gandy for five years, star on Strictly and land a BBC Radio One presenting job. Now, Mollie’s happily loved up with England cricketer boyfriend Stuart Broad, who she’s been dating on and off since early . After being pictured “canoodling” at a polo match together in , singer Ellie Goulding and Prince Harry were reportedly an item, exchanging flirty texts, with one onlooker even claiming they shared a kiss while under a blanket. They became close after Ellie performed at his brother William’s wedding to Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton, and she attended the Invictus Games with the prince in . While things clearly didn’t work out, the pop star still had her own ‘royal wedding’ at York Minster Cathedral, which was estimated could have cost up to £million. Guests included Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, royal photographer Matt Porteous captured their big day, and crowds lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the bride as she made her way to the altar to wed art dealer Casper Jopling. It hasn’t all been smooth sailing however – Ellie recently revealed she hadn’t seen her mother Tracey since the wedding last August. Doctor Who actress Jenna Coleman was rumoured to have briefly dated Harry in , with the Duke pictured resting his hand on Jenna’s leg at a posh polo party. However, it didn’t last, and when their paths crossed in  while Harry was on a secret trip to Amsterdam with Meghan, the pair had an ‘awkward’ encounter and avoided speaking, with a source telling Vanity Fair: “It was pretty awkward and some of the other guests were commenting on it.Jenna looked down while Harry looked straight ahead, while Meghan didn’t seem to notice.Jenna, now , went on to date Victoria co-star Tom Hughes for four years, before splitting recently, with a source telling The Sun: “Both Tom and Jenna are terribly sad, but the relationship ran its course. “Jenna’s career is going from strength to strength, she’s being offered increasingly more roles abroad, especially Los Angeles, and she wants to focus on this while she’s still young.”So while Prince Harry has moved on from his lothario days to settle down, given the amount of lavish weddings and babies among them, it seems the majority of his past loves have also quite happily been able to put their royal romance behind them too. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make

That he can get away with it shows what a private member’s club this house is.“Is packing the Lords with party loyalists really a priority, as a pandemic rages across the world  This move is an absolute insult to voters. This is making a mockery of democracy.“Today marks a nail in the coffin for the idea that the Lords is some kind of independent chamber of experts.

It needs fixing.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

However, in its current form it fails to provide a dependable safety net. It has led to an unprecedented number of people relying on foodbanks and not being able to pay their rent.He said some features of the system were harming women, disabled people and the vulnerable.And he added: “Universal Credit needs more money to catch up after  years of cuts to the social security budget and substantial reform to its design.“The five-week wait for a first payment must be replaced by a non-repayable two-week grant to all claimants.The Lords report also recommends that the punitive taper rate should be reduced - another aim of The Suns campaign - to encourage more people into work.And it says all claimants should have a higher work allowance to allow them to keep more of their hard-earned cash too.The Lords also conclude that including childcare support in Universal Credit was a mistake and paying in arrears is a huge barrier to work - as we have repeatedly highlighted.In some cases it has been a disincentive to work, the report says.The Government should remove childcare support from Universal Credit and be made into a new standalone benefit paid, it added.Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said of the report: “Sadly, this report confirms what many have known for a long time – Universal Credit is simply not working. There is clear consensus that the system is not delivering on its objectives and is instead pushing people further into poverty and debt.Ministers should listen to their Conservative colleagues’ calls for a reformed social security system.The DWP said in response to the report it would consider their recommendations in detail.Minister for Welfare Delivery Will Quince said of the report: “The case for Universal Credit has never been stronger. The system defied its critics in unprecedented and unforeseeable circumstances, processing more than .m new claims at pace since mid-March and paying more than a million advances worth hundreds of millions of pounds to those in urgent need within days.“We remain committed to supporting the most vulnerable in society, which is why we currently spend over £ billion a year on the benefits system. We’ve also increased the Universal Credit standard allowance by up to £, a year, as part of a package of welfare measures worth over £. billion.“We welcome the acknowledgement by the Committee that Universal Credit is here to stay and we will consider their recommendations in detail.”IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said England has probably reached the limit of easing the coronavirus lockdown, or is close to it after plans to ease more restrictions were cancelled. Boris Johnson reversed the decision to allow casinos, bowling alleys and beauty salons to reopen on August  for at least a fortnight. But they could have to wait even longer after a recent spike in cases means it may no longer be possible to ease social distancing measures any further. The Prime Minister was askedthere would have to be trade-offs to meet his goal of getting all pupils back in Englandaposs schools from September . And there are fears from experts that these could include a national ban on social meet-ups indoors and possibly the closing of pubs. People may also once again be asked to avoid using public transport, reports say. He replied at a press conference: Your basic point is a very good one about the trade-offs that weaposre looking at here. I do believe getting our children back to school on September ... that should be a national priority. And Prof Whitty spelt out the grim situation more clearly. He said: “The idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong.  I think what weaposre seeing from the data from ONS and other data is that we have probably reached near the limit or the limits of what we can do in terms of opening up society. So what that means potentially is thatwe wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things. And these will be dficult trade-offs, some of which will be decisions for government and some of which are for all of us as citizens to do.  But we have to be realistic about this. The idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong. “And what we’re seeing is that that we are at the outer edge of what we can do - and therefore, choices will need to be made. “People I think are very clear, for example, that schools are an absolute priority for the welfare of children.” The trade-offs could see families asked to avoid using public transport or meeting other households from September. Some experts also fear pubs and restaurants may also have to close in order to allow schools to reopen fully in September. Sir Jeremy Farrar, Chair of the Wellcome Trust, told The Sun reopening schools was about “choices and trade-offs” that would include workplaces, public transport, pubs and “many others”. It comes as the Governmentaposs scientic advisory group for emergencies - or SAGE, says there needs to be sufficient headroom in the rate of Covid- infections in order for schools to reopen safely. On June , the group said there may be a need to change measures at the end of the summer in order to be able to keep R below  whilst proceeding with the planned reopening of schools.  A meeting on July  highlighted that the spread from children to adults appears to be low and outbreaks in schools are extensions of community outbreaks and comprise small numbers, rather than indicating that schools are high-risk settings. However, scientists warned it is important to ensure that there will be enough aposroomapos in terms of the epidemic to open schools in September. It follows the news that local lockdown measures were announced in parts of the North West of England and areas of West Yorkshire, banning people from dferent households meeting indoors or in gardens following a spike in virus cases.  Mr Johnson told the briefing on Friday: As we see these rises around the world, we canapost fool ourselves that we are exempt. We must be willing to react to the first signs of trouble. He added: We cannot be complacent and I wonapost stand by and allow this virus to threaten to cause more pain and more heartache in our country. He said that, with numbers rising, our assessment is that we should squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control. The measures leave Mr Johnsonaposs prediction that things wouldto normal by Christmas in tatters amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus.  The Office for National Statistics released its latest data on new Covid- infections which show there were , fresh cases from July  to  – up from , the previous week. And the Government’s Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies announced it is “no longer confident that R is currently below one in England”.

Itaposs natural that people want to shoot the messenger, butyou donapost read the column, donapost like the column you read, or donapost understand the words in it, then you leave me no choice. I shall just have to communicate with you more clearly.And Matt Hancock agrees. He is, as he felt necessary to point out to Radio  listeners this morning, the Health Secretary in the middle of a global pandemic, so you will excuse me for being concerned about the health of the British public. Yeah. Itaposs the other stuff thereaposs no excuse for, Matthew.Announcing a local lockdown,  hours before it began, for .m people on a social media site whose users are % affluent millennials, Mr Hancock said: The spread is largely due to households meeting and not abiding to social distancing.Except the government messaging on social distancing is so chaotic that % of Brits have no idea what the rules are any more.When was the last time you heard a government minister remind you to wash your hands  Itaposs been weeks*. Compare that, class, to the last time you heard a government minister say that masks were not really necessary. You may find that one has been signicantly more recent, and effective, than the other. The people of Rochdale, Leicester, Blackburn, Burnley, Calderdale, Rossendale, Kirklees, Bradford, Hyndburn, Pendle, and Greater Manchester are more likely to be meeting up with others in non-socially distant situations because thataposs the nature of the jobs they are more likely to do, and Boris Johnson ordered them all back to work a fortnight ago. Those areas have lower wages, higher occupancy housing, and more manufacturing. More towns, and fewer villages. None of those things are consistent with staying metres apart, and a month ago the government told them not to bother so much with that, anyway.The people who live there are also more likely to have health conditions which make them more susceptible, and the government told them to stop shielding yesterday . Worldwide, the two factors consistently linked to lower coronavirus rates are early lockdowns and comprehensive testing.We locked down late, as even the Prime Minister grudgingly half-agrees, and our world-beating test and trace system is about the worldaposs worst. Of the .m coronavirus home testing kits sent through the post, only m have been processed. These privately-provided, non-NHS tests are complex, unpleasant, must be collected quickly to be viable, and some people report them being damaged or dropped in a puddle by the courier. Eventhey are sent back, the chances of a  negative are somewhere between  in  and  in . Either way, .m people who should have been tested werenapost. And a fortnight ago, Hancock announced an urgent review of... the way deaths are counted, which may be a few hundred out and therefore making the government look so much worse than it really is. Caposmere, thereaposs more! In June it was revealed that outsourced, inexperienced, Serco tracers contacted an average of . people each. Trained Public Health England officials found  people each. The multi-million-pound private contracts which lost .m tests and needed  members of staff to trace  human were in the gt of, under the oversight of, and signed off by, Matt Hancock.And just yesterday he told the Royal College of Physicians that in future the health service must draw on the ideas and expertise of the private sector because people donapost care who has provided the test. They care itaposs not you, Matt.And he added that bureaucracy - translation: public servants whoaposve done a better job than him thus far - must be cut. There are no ideologues in a pandemic, he trilled, despite the fact he has stuck to the ideology of a competitive, open market in healthcare through the piling-up of, to date, , corpses.  The government guidance, issued overnight on the same fag packet that contains all the previous guidance, says people can go to restaurants with members of their own households, but not pubsthereaposs a stranger there.They can leave the restricted area to go to work, but people from outside the restricted area cannot come to visit. They cannot meet people in gardens, but they can meet in parks. They should use public transport, and must use masks, but no-one will tell them offthey donapost. Oh, and it also claims West Yorkshire is now in the North West. See, Matt, this is why no-one listens to you. You couldnapost find your arse with a map, because you canapost read a map. But itaposs not Mattaposs fault. No. Itaposs the Spanish, whose infection rate is still lower than ours, or the second wave that is not sweeping Europe. For preference, though, itaposs the disease-ridden Muslims the finger is pointed at. So letaposs pepper the order to lockdown with references to the Islamic festival of Eid-al-Adha, which canapost be blamed for any of this because it only started yesterday.Matt does hope you have a nice time, butall those wonderfully-erse, one-quarter ethnic minority places could stay at home, go to work, sit in a park, go to the pub, go to mosque, and take the blame for the omnicrapshambles heaposs made of everything, that would be wonderful.Because letaposs be perfectly clear. The infection rate has tripled in the past week in Oxford, the High Peak, and Watford, doubled in Brighton and Tunbridge Wells, increased by a factor of  in the Ribble Valley and Bolsover, and no-one is telling the residents of those places to behave themselves better. Because in Oxford, the worst of these listed, coronavirus is in just .% of the population.Meanwhile, the infection rate in Blackburn with Darwen which is the worst district in the country, is .%. Last week, when lockdown wasnapost necessary, it was .%.We just canapost ignore this evidence, say Matt and his mates, who have all happily ignored calls for an inquiry into why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities are more likely to catch and die from coronavirus.They also ignore the fact the infection rate in care homes a couple of months ago was %, that they didnapost find it necessary to do much about it, and those same care homes have just been told thereaposll be no more tests for  weeks.Theyaposd much rather you think corona is on the march, and thataposs thanks to the poor, brown people who wonapost stay indoors and definitely not down to the rich, white people who wonapost shut up.

People over  have been entitled to a free TV licence since , allowing them to watch TV and listen to BBC radio without paying the annual charge. This exemption was due to end in June but the controversial move was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. An estimated .million pensioners currently receive the benefit but will now have to pay £. per year to use their TV. Hereaposs what the changes mean for you. What are the current rules   Anyone who watches live TV or uses BBC Iplayer must pay £. per year for a TV licence for their household. If you do not use a TV then you do not have to pay. The licence free can be paid in installments or as a lump sum - and people who fail to pay can be prosecuted. Over-s have been exempt from paying the fee since , with the shortfall paid by the Government. What happens on August   More than three million households lose their entitlement to a free licence fee. TV licensing will write to all licence holders over  to explain how to pay the fee. Specialist call centres have been set up to help people deal with the change, and it can also be done online, so no one has to leave their homes to pay during the pandemic.  Does this affect everyone over   No. Anyone who receives pension credit can still claim a free TV licence, which will be funded by the BBC. Households where someone claims this benefit - which is available for the poorest pensioners - are able to apply for a free licence. More than .million people claim pension credit, according to Government figures. The BBC said it had received more than , applications already. Why are these changes happening   The BBC took the decision to axe the free licence fee amid a major squeeze on its budgets. The corporation said funding the exemption for pensioners would cost it some £million annually by -. It had been handed responsibility for paying for the free licence fee for the elderly in  by the Government, which previously footed the bill. It is a source of tension between the Government and the BBC - with each side criticising the other for the controversial move. The Tories previously pledged to protect the benefit in their  manesto. And Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said scrapping the free licence fee for pensioners was the wrong decision. But critics say the principle responsibility lies with the Government.

However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced today that face coverings will be compulsory in indoor settings where people are likely to come into contact with others they would not usually meet.This includes cinemas, churches and museums. The guidance currently recommends that face masks are worn in these settings, but it will be made mandatory next week. Brides and grooms at wedding ceremonies will be exempt, but their guests will not. Speaking about the new rules, Mr Johnson said: I have asked the Home Secretary to work with the police and others to ensure the rules which are already in place are properly enforced. That means local authorities acting to close down premises and cancel events which are not following Covid Secure guidance. And it means a greater police presence to ensure face coverings are being worn where this is required by law. The announcement came as more planned lockdown easing was scrapped just  hours before more venues were due to reopen. Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining beauty parlours will no longer open on August , nationwide. The PM said in a No press conference: “We should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control. He added: “Weaposre now seeing a warning light on the dashboard. It is right to respond in the way that we are.” They will have to remain closed for at least another fortnight, Mr Johnson added.Official figures today point to a slight increase in the number of new  coronavirus  cases in England as a whole for the first time since the peak in April. The Office for National Statistics estimates there were around , new cases per day in the community in England in the week to July . That estimate is up from , the week before and , the week before that. Although week-on-week figures canapost be directly compared, the ONS said there is now evidence of a rise. An ONS statement said: There is now some evidence to suggest the number of people newly infected with COVID- has increased in recent weeks. It comes as the UK death toll reached , after another  fatalities. This is a big rise on yesterdayaposs total of  and Wednesdayaposs of , while Tuesday reported almost the same number - .

Today, he dramatically put the breaks on the next round of lockdown easings. Top medical advisor Chris Whitty candidly observed we’re now at the ‘limits’ of what can be opened. It’s not the summer families were expecting. But it is understandable in the circumstances. This week we had official confirmation that England has had the worst death rate in Europe. It is now beyond doubt that earlier this year Boris Johnson was too slow to wake up to the horric consequences of this virus. We’re now seeing infection rates increase across the country. Some countries in Europe are experiencing signicant upticks. The virus is accelerating in parts of the world. Urgent action is necessary. That’s why Labour supports the restrictions that have been put in place. But we need ministers to go further. We need mass testing so everyone can quickly find out their Covid status. And we need an effective system that follows up people who have been in touch with someone who is sick with the virus. Local health workers don’t know who is isolating and can’t check on them. This isn’t the “world beating” system we were promised - yet its costing us £ billion and there still too many holes in our defences. If we are to avoid further widespread lockdowns, the system needs to be up and working. In a pandemic like this, clarity is everything. One of the key lessons of this crisis is that when communication from government become confused or lacks clarity, problems emerge. People lose faith in the public health messaging. This new restrictions were announced just after pm, a few hours before they were due to take effect. The actual guidance people were expected to follow came hours later. People are being asked toto work even though they can’t access childcare or now use extended family outside of their bubble.  Those who work in homes like plumbers and electricians have been left in the dark about whether they are allowed to carry on working or not. And families in a city like Leicester desperate for a holiday still don’t know when the restrictions on ‘non-essential’ travel will be lted. People have made great sacrices. They deserve better.

But Health Secretary Matt Hancock issued conflicting information, telling BBC Breakfast viewers: Meeting another household in pub gardens or outdoor restaurant space is not allowed under the new restrictions.Now the official guidance has been updated to confirm Mr Hancock was wrong.It now states: You can continue to meet in public outdoor spaces including outdoor seating or beer gardens in groups of no more than  people, unless the group includes only people from two households. Customers dining or drinking indoors will only be able to sit with people they live with, or members of their support bubble.  Meeting up in private gardens is still banned - and new laws will be passed to enforce it. Police will be able to ask people meeting in private homes and gardens to disperse and issue fixed penalty notices starting at £ - halving to £paid in the first  days – and doubling for repeat offences. Restaurant and bar owners in Manchester say they have been hit by a wave of cancellations  - including for outdoor bookings - as a result of last nightaposs announcement and the subsequent confusion over beer gardens.

In March, the Government ordered . million people with serious health conditions to stay indoors to protect them from coronavirus. The restrictions have been slowly eased, with shielded people allowed to meet up with up to five people from July . And from today the shielding advice ends completely in England and Scotland - except in some areas with a spike in coronavirus cases. In Wales it ends on August . But itaposs controversial. Boris Johnson has been slammed for refusing to delay the end of ‘shielding’ support despite pausing other easings to lockdown. The Prime Minister yesterday announced a raft of lockdown-easing measures would be postponed.But the plan to end help for people at increased risk from Covid- will still go ahead - despite charities branding the move “desperately unfair.” Extremely clinically vulnerable people who have stayed at home to protect themselves from Covid- are allowed toto work from today. In an open letter to Rishi Sunak signed by  charities, including Age UK and Macmillan Cancer Support, raises concerns that those who have been shielding will be forced to choose between their health and their job. Hereaposs what is changing. Who was told to shield by the Government   Millions of people received letters from the Government telling them to shield because of their medical history. Doctors drew up a list of conditions likely to make people particularly at risk of being seriously ill with coronavirus. This included organ donor recipients, people with certain types of cancer and those with severe respiratory conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. Pregnant women, some people over s and those who usually need a flu jab to cope with underlying health conditions were also told to shield. However the advice was not compulsory - it was for peopleaposs own protection from the virus. What changes from August  From the beginning of August, the Government is pausing advice to people to shield unless there is a spike in coronavirus cases. After months of lockdown, shielded people will be able toto work, to go to the shops, to exercise outside and visit places of worship, as long as they observe social distancing. Children who are deemed clinically vulnerable can go back to school when term begins. However the official advice is still to be careful as the risk of vulnerable people getting severely ill from coronavirus remains. People are told to stay at home as much as you can and continue to take precautions when you do go out. Regular handwashing, avoiding touching your face, and keeping two metres away from people outside is still advised.  Should some people still shield  Yes. Shielding in Wales on ends on August . In England, most areas are pausing shielding. People in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and Lancashire, for example, can still stop shielding despite facing new restrictions. Exceptions are Luton and Blackburn with Darwen, where shielding should continue to August . In Leicester shielding also continues until at least August  and could run in some parts of the city beyond that. Will the support end  Free food parcels, medicine deliveries and care offered to shielded people will stop from August . But vulnerable people can still rely on help from NHS Volunteer Responders to pick up their groceries and prescriptions. You can still get priority slots for online shoppingyou are already registered. What had already changed on July   Vulnerable people were given the go ahead to meet up with up to five friends after months without being allowed to socialise. The Government announced shielded people could form support bubbles with one other household - allowing people to meet inside and outside without social distancing. Those shielding were told they no longer needed to social distance from people living in their own household. WhatI am worried about going back to work   The Government guidance says vulnerable people canto workthey cannot work from home. Employers must ensure that social distancing measures are in place. If you are able to work from home then your boss is expected to help you to do so.

Boris Johnsonaposs update to the nations just as millions affected by new local lockdowns in northern England coronavirus hot-spots face were told to follow stricter new rules, and with little notice. Residents of Greater Manchester, and parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire were plunged into chaos overnight as new Covid- restrictions were brought in. The ban took effect from midnight with just three hoursapos warning, and prohibit people from meeting other households in all indoor settings, including private homes and gardens. At a press conference on Friday afternoon, the Prime Minister outlined the reason for the new lockdowns, saying he had warned the Government would act aposswtly and decisivelyapos to stamp out local outbreaks - and more areas could follow. He also announced rule changes affecting all of England, declaring face coverings would be compulsory in more indoor settings including cinemas and churches. He postponed reopening of more settings including ice rinks, casinos and bowling alleys for another fortnight, along with wedding receptions of more than  people. He also put off reopening close-contact services - meaning beauty treatments like brows and facials due to restart on Saturday that many Brits will have booked in must be cancelled.  Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned the UK had potentially aposreached the limitapos of how much society could reopen, as infections rise once again. Here are the key changes and rules you need to know about from Saturday, August . All these venues are able to remain in most of England providing they can show they are aposCovid-secureapos:Hotels and BBs Holiday apartments or homes Cottages or bungalows Campsites Caravan parks Boarding houses Places of worship Libraries Community centres Restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens Bars Pubs Gyms Cinemas Nail bars Beauty salons Swimming pools, lidos and water parks Bingo halls Theatres and concert halls - but on the basis it’s not a live performance. They can only screen past performances for example Museums and galleries Hair salons and barbers Outdoor playgrounds Outdoor gyms Funfairs Theme parks Adventure parks and activities Amusement arcades Other indoor leisure centres and facilities - including indoor gaming, social clubs, model villages, and indoor attractions at aquariums and zoos. Face coverings and masks Face masks will be compulsory in more indoor spaces, in one of the biggest changes announced on Friday affecting all of England. The coverings are already mandatory on public transport, unless you have a medical reason or disability that allows you to be exempt from the rules. That includes conditions like asthma, and also people accompanying someone with a condition who needs to be able to lip-read their companion. From August  the new rules will become law, and will required face coverings be worn in indoor settings where it is dficult to practise social distancing - including cinemas, galleries and houses of worship like churches. The PM will ask police to crack down harder on those breaking the rules. Read more about this rule change here.  You can visit cinemas, galleries and museums - but not have a big wedding reception Wedding receptions of more than  people have been banned throughout England with just  hours notice. Rules were set to change from August  in England to allow small, socially-distanced receptions of up to  people. However, the move was one of those postponed for at least two weeks today by Boris Johnson.  Wedding ceremonies of up to  people have already been allowed in England since July  and can continue - including in Greater Manchester, which is among the northern areas facing separate restrictions from today. However, guests must be socially-distanced and the ceremony must follow Covid-secure guidelines.  With face coverings mandatory in places of worship from August  - though itaposs not yet clearthereaposll be exemptions for the bride and groom. The PM also postponed the reopening of more indoor gatherings and businesses that were due to restart tomorrow. Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services must remain closed, he said Indoor performances will not resume - ruling out live music, theatre, and dance, and indoor classes. Larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will also remain off limits Wedding receptions of up to  people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can continue to take place, in line with coronavirus guidelines. You can get a haircut - but you still canapost get your brows done Hairdressers and barbers remain open with protective measures - including face visors for those cutting hair. Nail and beauty salons are now open too. Beauty salons were given the go ahead to re-open on July , just over a week after hairdressers were given the green light. But there remains restrictions on procedures including eyebrow treatments, facials, eye lash tinting and face waxing. More treatments were due to be allowed from August . However the PM today announced the changes due to take effect on Saturday would be postponed at least another fortnight. What you still canapost do anywhere in England: Large wedding receptions  Attend sports matches in a large crowd  Big gigs  Nightclubs  Casino  Bowling alleys and skating rinks  Indoor play areas including soft play  Conference centres, other than people who already work thereYou can visit friends and family indoors - but you still canapost hug People in most of England can have friends and family round to their house to eat, hang out and stay overnight - but they still can’t hug. You can also meet in all indoor settings like pubs and restaurants, provided they follow social distancing rules. Indoor gatherings will be allowed between two households who havenapost joined together in a “bubble”. Bubbles - a permanent joining of two households which let people break social distancing rules and stay over - still havenapost been expanded. Currently bubbles can be formed of two households. One of the bubble households has to have only one adult in it, such as a grandparent living alone, a single parent with kids, or a couple who live apart where at least one lives alone. Your household is allowed to meet with one other household at a time. That potentially includes staying over at someone’s house, as long as social distancing rules are followed indoors. More on the changes to these rules for northern lockdowns follow below.  Meeting outdoors Currently up to six people from up to six households can meet in a park or garden,they maintain social distancing - and that hasnapost changed for most of England except in the new lockdown areas. Two households of any size - for example, two families of four - can also meet outdoors, as long as they maintain social distancing. So you can either meet five friends from dferent households, or an unlimited number of friends from one household. This is guidance. The law only prohibits gatherings of more than  people - except for indoor gatherings in the new lockdown area . You can go to the pub - but you can only meet one other household inside Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens remain open. If youaposre indoors, you can only meet with people from one other household. And you should still maintain social distancing rules. That means staying either two metres apart, or one metre apart with mitigation measuresyou canapost manage two metres. It means no propping up the bar or standing in groups, and pubs will be encouraged to have table service where possible. All venues - from pubs to places of worship - will be expected to keep a record of people who visit, to enable contact tracing. More on the changes to these rules for northern lockdowns follow below.  You can go on staycation to English hotels, BBs and campsites - but not hostels Hotels, BBs, holiday apartments or homes, cottages or bungalows, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses are all reopen to paying guests in England. They must follow coronavirus guidelines - but people will be able to stay overnight away from their home. Despite concerns over shared facilities, campsites are reopen too, as long as they have showers and washing-up blocks. Hostels with shared bedrooms cannot yet reopen. The government has not said people in northern regions cannot travel. People in the new lockdown zone, such as Greater Manchester, may continue to travel in and out of the new lockdown area, as long as you do not break the rules on meetings indoors. You canapost send your child to school Only years R,  and  are allowed back to primary schools in England at the moment. The government wants all children back in September - but was forced to drop plans to do it earlier. Boris Johnson said today getting kids back to school by September remains a aposnational priority.apos  Shielding people can meet groups of friends outside Shielding was eased for .million vulnerable people in England earlier this morng. Shielding people can go out and meet up to five friends - andthey live alone, form a aposbubbleapos with another household. From August , the advice to shield ends completely. But Statutory Sick Pay and direct food parcels for the shielding will also end tomorrow.  You can go back to the office or use public transport -your workplace is apossafeapos Guidelines on avoiding public transport unless itaposs absolutely necessary remain. The government has been urging workplaces to begin reopeningthey can follow social distancing guidelines indoors safely. Everyone  should carry on working from homeat all possible. You can travel abroad - with limits You can travel abroad - and aposair bridgesapos mean no quarantine for Brits heading back from summer holidays in some parts of Europe and farther afield. However the limits of the policy have been felt by Spain holidaymakers, after a series of outbreaks sparked the UK government to close the air bridge abruptly. The UK allows travellers coming from a select list of countries to arrive without a -day quarantine period, including Brits ing from holidays from those countries. See which countries remain on the air bridge list here.  Lockdown changes for Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, and West Yorkshire New laws are being passed to ban meeting people from other households in private homes or gardens, or travelling in cars together. People can still meet in a public area like a parkthey follow social distancing rules. People will also still be able to visit pubs or restaurants - but only with their own households, and they canapost meet up with others indoors - even in beer gardens. They also wonapost be able to visit care homes. There will be some exceptions, such as for household bubbles. The government shortly after midnight updated guidance saying the government would pass new laws to enforce changes to the new northern lockdowns. While it made clear people will be fined £ for breaking the rules in the localised restrictions, the law to enforce it did not exist at the time the lockdowns kicked in.

After temperatures soared to C in some parts on Friday, officials expect thousands to again flock to coastal towns over the weekend. But beaches are becoming unmanageable due to large swathes of visitors, local authorities have said. Coastguards had their busiest day for more than four years yesterday - when the UK recorded its third hottest day ever - as it dealt with  incidents, the most on a single day in four years. A woman suffered serious injuries after slipping off a clf edge and falling ft in Dorset. On Saturday, crews were needed on Porthcurno Beach - one of Cornwallaposs most popular destinations among tourists - to deal with an incident. There were  incidents dealt with on Friday, including people cut off by the tide and reports of missing children. Some people will remember July  for all the wrong reasons, said HM Coastguardaposs duty operations director.  We completely understand that people want to enjoy the coast, said Julie-Anne Wood. We also know that even the most experienced swimmer, paddleboarder and walker can be caught out by currents and tides respectively.Temperatures reached .Cat Londonaposs Heathrow Airport at .pm and also reached .Cat Kew Gardens, in west London, the Met Office said.Thanet District Council asked people to avoid four of the areaaposs beaches, including Margateaposs Main Sands, due to the number of visitors.  Leader of the council Cllr Rick Everitt told the PA news agency: Early on, it became clear that they were going to reach levels of which we were concerned about. If you have too many people on the beach, it just becomes unmanageable from that point of view. A -year-old woman was badly hurt after slipping off a clf edge at Old Harry Rocks near Swanage. Coastguard teams, as well as the RNLI, ambulance service, police, fire service, rescue helicopter and air ambulance were called to assist.  A spokesman for Swansage Coastguard said the woman had slipped off the clf edge at Old Harry falling ft. The female had suffered some serious injuries and was air-lted from the base of the clf to be treated by medics on the clf top before being flown for specialist treatment at Southampton hospital.

Many were stuck in their cars during the sweltering heat on the hottest day of the year so far at a seaside town. The beachgoers had no way out after Gwynedd Council closed the harbour area in Barmouth, Wales, to traffic earlier to help maintain social distancing measures. Many said their day out in the sunshine was ruined by the chaotic scenes.Gwynedd council tweeted this afternoon: “To help limit the spread of coronavirus, we’re putting one-way systems in place for pedestrians in some areas.“To help maintain social distancing measures, the harbour area in Barmouth has been closed to traffic for the time being. Please follow the signs that are in place.”The road was still closed at .pm, leaving hundreds trapped, reports North Wales Live.Father of two and product designer Lee Moulton, , has spent a week on holiday in the area with his family. They were due to travel home to Chester this evening, and said they only managed to escape the town after a BMW driver knocked down signs to get out of the car park. He said: The situation was crazy. There were hundreds of cars just stuck in the car park for almost three hours. The police should have been in the town after they closed the road but they left it up to volunteers to direct traffic and only turned up belatedly. Everyone was good natured but, in the end, one guy had had enough and took the matter into his own hands. It was like a rebellion and everyone followed. He was a hero! Others begged the police to come and release the traffic. @Daicycling tweeted North Wales Police: My we and  kids are stuck in standstill traffic just getting off the car park in Barmouth.

As restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey gives a glimpse of how le has changed over the past few months and how families view the “new normal”. The good news is that two thirds of parents of teenagers say all that time spent together at home has had a positive effect on their family. And the same applies to almost three quarters of those with kids under . Many families have created perfect memories by doing new activities together, such as playing board games, baking, walking and cycling.  Watching TV and streaming services have also provided family bonding time. Very asked parents to reflect on the past few months as they prepare for their children toto school full time. While for some it was stressful, juggling work, home schooling and quality time with the family, others found it fun and inspiring. Writer Gemma Cheetham lives with husband Mike and their two children, Ava-Violet, six, and Gabriel, one . She says the lockdown has made it feel like things have slowed down. She explained: For the first few weeks of lockdown I was working from home, and it was a struggle as Gabriel wanted to be with me all the time.  I’d end up logging on to work early in the morning, stopping at pm and starting again in the evening to make up lost hours. Normally, Mike would have taken the kids out, but when the restrictions came in he couldn’t do that. Then I got furloughed, and at first I enjoyed home schooling Ava-Violet and doing practical things like planting in the garden and baking banana bread.  But I started to notice a real dference in her. She just wanted to stay in the house. Even though we reassured her, she’d say things like, ‘I don’t want to go back to school, I want to stay safe and I want my family to stay safe.’ When her village school reopened, and she was in a small class bubble, she went back to her old self straightaway. She was glad to have the routine again, but she still likes having me at home. I feel like le has slowed down and we’ve been able to just appreciate each other’s company more. Another family feeling the benefit of spending more time together are the Blankstones. Mum Lisa and dad Mark live with daughter Olivia,  .  Estate agent Lisa told us: Olivia was due to sit her GCSEs and obviously she was upset when they were cancelled but since then she’s enjoyed being able to just chill out. I was furloughed, and Mark has his own optician’s which closed temporarily, so we were all at home. Olivia had schoolwork at first, but that eased off so we had lots of free time. We walked every day, exercised at home doing Joe Wicks and David Lloyd sessions. Olivia kept in touch with friends via video chats, and although she said a few times she wished she could see them properly, she was fine. She was disappointed to have our holiday cancelled, but she’s going to college and she’ll be more than ready to have some normality back again by September. We all get on well, so the biggest challenge for us was not being able to see other members of the family.

Suggestions of a rt between the sisters-in-law have been covered in a number of books on the younger royals, though with dfering accounts.In Kensington Palace aposAn Intimate Memoir from Queen Mary to Meghan Markle apos, Quinn writes: At first the couples got on well – William and Harry have always been close – but inevitably there were tensions.As one insider explains, aposboth William and Harry were always likely to be drawn to confident, strong women because they lost their mother so early. The insider continues:was very warm towards Meghan when she arrived. But tensions were bound to arise because Meghan inevitably had to accept that that although she is a Duchess she is not married to the next king. I think she has found that dficult to deal with and although Harry loved their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, Meghan and conscious that it was tiny in comparison to the vast apartment complex where Kate and William live.  Harry has nothing to prove. Meghan has everything to prove. Thataposs the problem. I know, for example, that tensions reached such a pitch that the Queen herself was driven to Kensington from Buckingham Palace to try to stop the bickering. However others have suggested Meghan and Kate werenapost duelling but just had nothing in common. Authors of the Meghan and Harry biography Finding Freedom claim there was no feud between the pair and rubbished claims that Kate was left in tears after one incident.  Its writers claim Meghan had hoped Kate would reach out to her but didnapost lose sleep over it when she did not. The alleged rt between the two couples stemmed from a growing coolness between Harry and William and not Meghan and Kate, according to co-authors Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie. They say the press were too quick to blame Meghan and Harryaposs decision to move to Windsor on the duelling duchesses when it was Harry who felt suffocated by his brother.

With the tell-all, bombshell book Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, set to be released just one week after her big day, Meghanaposs stated desire for more surprises could well be on the cards. Prince Harryaposs we will be spending her special day in her temporary LA home, a £million mansion on the Beverly Ridge Estate formerly owned by actor and producer Tyler Perry.While the coronavirus pandemic may make the day a more subdued affair, some form of excitement will not be far off, with scandal and revelations anticipated for the August  launch of the book.There is one thing the former Suits actress always asks for on her birthday.  Every year, she uses her new milestone to reflect on her le and make a few wishes about her future, inspired by her mum Doria Ragland.My mom has always said that birthdays are your own personal New Year, Meghan wrote in  on her now deleted The Tig lestyle website. Your own chance to make resolutions just for yourself and what you prognosticate for your year ahead. So what does Meghan wish for every year  More surprises, more adventure, more opportunities to grow, more days filled with giggles and cheeky jokes, more delicious meals, and more inspiration. Always more inspiration, she says. She previously imparted these words of wisdom to her website followers, after years of struggling with her identity. She candidly admitted how her s were brutal and how she was always judging her weight and appearance. Meghan spoke of how her school days were even worse and she tried everything to avoid eating her lunch alone. She wrote: My s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool as hip as smart as aposwhateverapos as everyone . My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant. My high school had cliques: the black girls and white girls, the Filipino and the Latina girls. Being biracial, I fell somewhere in between. So everyday during lunch, I busied myself with meetings – French club, student body, whatever one could possibly do between noon and pm- I was there. Not so that I was more involved, but so that I wouldn’t have to eat alone.  But in , Meghan declared she was the happiest sheaposs ever been. I am  years old today, she said. And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it. She added: So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gt: I want you to be kind to yourself. I want you to challenge yourself.  I want you to stop gossiping, to try a food that scares you, to buy a coffee for someone just because, to tell someone you love them…and then to tell yourself right back. I want you to find your happiness. And on her birthday in  she said: I am feeling so incredibly joyful right now, so grateful and content that all I could wish for is more of the same. Meghan will certainly find the rest of  something of an adventure - but perhaps a trying one, as the royal author behind the bombshell new biography claims a lot of damage has been done between the Sussexes and the Cambridges. Omid Scobie has joined fellow journalist Carolyn Durand to pen Finding Freedom, which tells the story of the coupleaposs decision to quit the royal family.  Speaking ahead of its release, Scobie told People magazine: A lot of damage has been done. The book talks about the fallout between the brothers and wives, claiming Meghan and Kate had a strained relationship from day one. They write: Though it was not necessarily her responsibility, Kate did little to bridge the ide. However Scobie and Durand claim that despite their dferences, the two women didnapost get on, rather they simply had nothing in common and there were some awkward moments. The book also focuses on Harryaposs upset and anger with William in the lead up to the royal wedding, and claims he felt his brother was being snobbish towards Meghan.  According to their sources, Wills said: Don’t feel like you need to rush this and take as much time as you need to get to know this girl. They write: Harry was p***ed off. P***ed off that his brother would ask such a thing. Some felt it was an overreaction. But then, this totally sums them up as people — William the calm and rational one, and Harry, who can’t help but take things far too personally. According to the authors, William was happy for his brother, but just wanted to make sure that Harry wasnapost blindsided by lust.  The book quotes a friend of Harry as saying: “Harry could see through William’s words. He was being a snob.” His younger brother allegedly took offence to the phrase this girl, and interpreted it as snobbish and condescending. The rest of the royals were also apparently less than welcoming, with one senior royal allegedly referring to Meghan as Harryaposs showgirl - and another saying she comes with a lot of baggage. Another senior courtier is said to have told a colleague: Thereaposs just something about her I donapost trust.

And she finally hit the jackpot when she landed her big break as paralegal Rachel Zane in hit US legal drama, Suits.So when she and Prince Harry went on their first secret date at Soho House’s Dean Street Townhouse - where she sipped martinis and he drank beer - she was already quite a wealthy woman.But the Duchess of Sussex hasnapost always been accustomed to dating princes and mingling with A-Listers such as Serena Williams and Amal Clooney. In fact she has had her fair share of normal jobs to make ends meet. One of her more under the radar jobs was for singer Robin Thicke. The star and his now ex-we Paula Patton hired Meghan to do their invitations. Meghan at the time was working as a freelance calligrapher and her enviable skills meant she wrote all the invitations to the coupleaposs wedding. Speaking to Esquire in , she said: “I went to an all-girls Catholic school for like six years during the time when kids actually had handwriting class. “I’ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well. What it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning. “I didn’t wait tables. I did calligraphy for the invitations for, like, Robin Thicke and Paula Patton’s wedding.” She added: It was great [income] while I was auditioning. Meghan also hosted two-hour calligraphy classes at a stationary store. Winnie Park, CEO of Paper Source where Meghan taught, told People: She taught calligraphy, and hosted a group of customers and instructed them during a two-hour class on how to do calligraphy.  It was her part-time job as she was going through auditions. Winnie said Meghan also led classes on gt-wrapping and book-binding. Meanwhile, Meghanaposs first job came about when she was just . She sold frozen yogurt at a shop called Humphrey Yogart in Calornia. Her former boss, Paula Sheftel, said: She earned minimum wage and was very popular with customers. She had to prove she had an outgoing personality and would work well with staff.  Meghan deleted all her social media accounts before she married Harry. But she had tweeted that she had met one of her idols Baywatch actress Yasmine Bleeth in the parking lot of the frozen yogurt shop. She said she said to her: Oh my God, I loved you in that Soft  Dri commercial to which Yasmine replied: OK, thank you! Meghanaposs other film roles include having a part in the  film A Lot Like Love with Ashton Kutcher. She had a short scene and was just called hot girl in the credits.  MONEY reported she was only supposed to say hi but she convinced the director to give her five lines. In her quest to become a successful actress Meghan also worked on a game show where she modelled briefcases in . She joined the game show Deal or No Deal and became part of a group of women whose job was to wear matching outfits and hold the numbered cases. The contestants had to guess which suitcase might contain  million . A colleague said she made an episode but she didnapost like the job.  Meghan told Esquire that the role was uncomfortable as she was standing up there forever in these terribly uncomfortable and inexpensive five-inch heels just waiting for someone to pick my number so I could go and sit down. Like many thespians who seek a big break Meghan worked as a waitress She told Vanity Fair is one of those things that actors do. However very little is known about where she worked and whether she enjoyed serving diners. Meghan also starred in a commercials for Tostitos in .  Meghan is browsing the aisles of a grocery store trying to decide what to buy when a voice, which is not hers, says:  ingredients  Thataposs more people than I invited to the party. Meghan picks up a bag of Tostitos that shows it has three ingredients. Seven months before Meghan and Harry announced their engagement, she shut down the lestyle blog she ran.

Snap, a bus and coach crowd souring company, has teamed up with tour operators, including The Original Tour, to launch aposCovid-Secure Transportapos. The radical new idea could see many commuters enjoy a breezy aposopen topapos start to their day or a aposluxury executive coachapos- practically to themselves. Video shared from the initial trial run showed a number of office workers were delighted to ditch their confined commute for something a little dferent. And whilst the idea is still in its early stages, Snap hopes it can get more of the two-hundred and thirty three open top tourism buses currently operating within London involved. So how does this aposcrowd sourcingapos your way to the office idea work  Well, commuters simply need suggest a route Via Snapaposs website by inputting their home and office address.  Thenthere are a sufficient number of people aposmatchingapos with your route, youaposll be able to chose between an open top bus or an executive bus and your route will start running. This makes the open top option ideally suited to a large group of people who all need to get to the same area, but youaposd be surprised how many people can match with your route. In comparison with say the tube or a public bus, the distancing ratio is twelve people to one fty-seat coach, and all vehicles are cleaned thoroughly before and after your journey.  The trial run of the service saw an open top bus aposshadowapos the busy Victoria Line and pick passengers up from Walthamstow Central taking them over to Victoria. This comes after TFL told commuters to avoid the line for itaposs entiredue to overcrowding. Thomas Ableman, founder of Snap, said “Since our launch in , we’ve run  million miles of passenger travel on buses and coaches. But we’ve never before offered open-top commuter services. However, this crisis requires fresh thinking and open top buses are the perfect way to get people into the office in safety and comfort.”  If Snap were successful in its bid for more tour operators to join in with the idea they estimate up to , people could travel to work across the UK this way. Those on board will also receive an SMS messageit turns out anyone theyaposve travelled with have tested positive for coronavirus, similar to the text and trace system now being used in many UK restaurants. The route will also be a lot more direct, meaning no switching to a dferent service and commuters will know nobody  has travelled in their seat that day. Whilst youaposll still have to wear a face covering, the service would let aposopen topapos passengers travel in a vehicle with an abundance of fresh air.

Court documents unsealed as part of the Ghislaine Maxwell child sex trafficking case contain allegations the Duke of York urged US prosecutors to approve the deal which would have meant Epstein avoiding more serious charges and having a shorter sentence. A friend of the duke told The Times the allegation was “a straightforward untruth. No s,no buts.” An appeals court that released other documents from the same civil suit last year advised the claims should be treated with caution and read by the public with discernment.  The documents claim in  - when Epstein faced a series of allegations of sexually abusing minors in Florida - the Queen’s son put pressure on the government. The paedophile was jailed for only  months in . The unsealed testimony also has allegations that Epstein sent Prince Andrew, , an under-age girlfor him to have sex with, something that could later be used to blackmail him. The prince has always denied any wrongdoing and when the case was originally heard in  a judge ordered it to be struck from the record without ruling on its veracity. The papers, part of a  defamation case settled two years later between Virginia Giuffre and Maxwell, state: “Perhaps even more important to her role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had direct connections to other powerful iniduals with whom she could connect Epstein.  The documents state Epstein used his “signicant social and political connections . . . including efforts on his behalf by Prince Andrew”. The claims were unsealed by a federal judge late on Thursday night. Ms Maxwell, , was arrested last month and has pleaded not guilty to charges that she groomed minors for Epstein between  and .She had fought to stop the release of the documents, which also allege the royal had aposan orgy with under-aged girlsapos. The prince has yet to speak to the FBI about Epstein. Attorney Spencer Kuvin, who for  years has represented women abused by Epstein, told the Mirror: “Prince Andrew has a lot to answer for, given these new revelations, and we continue to implore him to step forward, be a man, and speak the truth about what he knows.

Ayesha Mervyn was spotted by officers lying outside a Manchester branch of McDonaldaposs surrounded by people. Concerned for the -year-old safety, they rushed to help her, before noticing she was carrying a bottle of Prosecco and rose wine. Manchester Magistratesapos Court heard, Mervyn staggered away and after refusing to provide her details, urinated.She was arrested for being drunk and disorderly, and spat in one of the officeraposs faces, the Manchester Evening News reports.She pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly and assaulting an emergency worker. Mervyn was sentenced to  weeks, suspended for  months. Prosecuting, Gareth Hughes said officers were patrolling at around pm on March  when they spotted Mervyn on the floor. The officer saw members of the public surrounding her, there were grazes on her knees and she was being sick on the floor,” Mr Hughes said.  She had a bottle of Prosecco and rose wine with her and her hair was stuck to her face. She was then sick in front of a shop window and it was clear that she was not in control of what she was doing. Her words were slurred, she could not stand and she was verbally aggressive towards the officers, refusing to provide her details.”  “One of the officers had hold of her right arm and then the defendant turned towards her and spat directly into her face, with the spit going into her hair, down the left side of her head and into her eye,” Mr Hughes added. “She was taken to the floor by the other officers while this officer attempted to get spit out of her eye. “Members of the public ran over handing the officer tissues and antibacterial wipes. “She also said there was an excessive amount of saliva dangling down from her hair and face.” Mervyn also made an unrepeatable sexual comment towards the officer.  In a statement read to the court, the officer said: “I have never been spat at, nor have I been assaulted in my career before. “She spat at me in front of numerous members of the public, I found it degrading and embarrassing. “It is the lowest form of physical abuse and it will have a long standing impact on my emotional state.  “I would rather a punch to the face than being spat at. “I was trying to help her and this is how I was treated.” Mervyn was said to have previous convictions - including two assaults on police officers a public order offence and shoplting. In mitigation, defence lawyer Stephen Connor said his client had a dficult upbringing, in which she was subjected to exploitation and abuse. “These issues need to be addressed - she needs a form of therapy to help her to come to terms with these issues,” Mr Connor said. “There is genuine remorse. “She is thoroughly ashamed and embarrassed of her actions and has apologised directly to the officer concerned.” "},{"url":null,"title":"farmhouse abandoned 40 years ago","story":"NewsFarmhouse abandoned  years ago filled with mannequins and eerie family photosThe Marion Carll Farmhouse was built in  but for more than four decades has remained empty and abandonedShareCommentsByJane LavenderAssistant Editor:,  AUG NewsThe farmhouse has been abandoned for more than  years\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

But  years ago the impressive white-washed building was left abandoned with only the ghosts of those who lived before now walking through its room. The house in Long Island, New York, in the US, was built before the American Civil War, and was given its name by long-time resident, Marion Carll, who moved in in . Marion was a school teacher who dedicated her le to serving the community she lived in. She worked in New York and the town of Commack but remained in the farmhouse all her le.  For  years she was Commackaposs District’s Treasurer and Census Taker and devoted her time to organising the areaaposs first Parent Teach Council. Marion was also said to be an active member of the local Methodist Church as well as several community groups. It came as no surprise to the town she had served all her le that on her death bed, Marion gted the farm property to the Commack School District. However, she had strict terms for the generosity in her will. Marion said the building must be used for historical education. The stunning home was like a window into the past and filled with a raft of historically important items along with those of every day use. On her request, a programme was set up but more than  years ago it became unsustainable and the th century farmhouse was abandoned. Since then it has been left to rot and fall into disrepair, with only eerie memories of its past glory left to be covered in dust and cobwebs. In , the Carll family launched a legal bid to reclaim ownership of the farmhouse, claiming it had been neglected by the school board in its duty of care. Their claim failed and there are now plans to transform the property into Marionaposs dream. Following its succesful legal battle, the school district asked urban explorer, Bryan Sansivero, to take a look inside the farmhouse and take pictures of what he saw. His images are a snapshot of what le was le in the th century. A cluttered writing desk stands covered in pens and paper but with nobody using it for four decades.There is a vintage bottle of medicine designed to prevent bedwetting and a creepy abandoned dress mannequin shrouded in decades of dust. Clothes still hang neatly in the wardrobes, while books litter chests of drawers and line the bookcases. Old family portraits, dating back more than  years are on shelves and hanging on the walls, while wallpaper slowly falls from the walls. An ancient sewing machine sits untouched and encased in layer upon layer of dust.Meanwhile a huge piano remains unplayed for  years, with only spiders and mice for company. Dried flowers and a used teacup are still placed on a side table while the dining table and chair look ready to be used at any moment. Bryan said: I was asked by the school district, who own the property, to document the house as it was found once they were awarded the property after a recent legal battle.

Connie Culp, from Ohio, received the miracle operation in  after her husband Thomas Culp shot her at point-blank range and left her horribly disfigured. The Cleveland Clinic, where Connie received the pioneering surgery, confirmed her death in a statement on Friday and hailed her as an inspiration. Dr Frank Papay, chair of the clinicaposs dermatology and plastic surgery institute, said: Connie was an incredibly brave, vibrant woman and an inspiration to many. Her strength was evident in the fact that she had been the longest-living face transplant patient to date. She was a great pioneer and her decision to undergo a sometimes-daunting procedure is an enduring gt for all of humanity. Dr Papay was part of a team of surgeons who carried out the pioneering op on Connie  years ago and had been in charge of her care since, WKYC reports. She made history with the ground-breaking face transplant where surgeons replaced  per cent of her face including a nose, cheeks, palate, upper jaw, lower eyelids and some of her bone structure.  Her face was obliterated in the gun attack by her jealous husband in September . After shooting his we in the attack at the bar they owned, he then put the gun in his own mouth and pulled the trigger, causing severe injuries. But like Connie, he survived. Connie spent months in hospital as surgeons tried to fix her terrible wounds. With her children Steven, , and Alicia, , at her side, the mum battled on, taking comfort in the ­miracle that she had survived.  She even visited her ex-husband in prison after his sentencing and later made their orce official, moving out of the home they once shared in Bloomingdale, Ohio. For four years, Connie underwent more than  painful operations and led a reclusive le. Connie was finally put on the face transplant waiting list in October  at the nearby Cleveland Clinic and medics were shocked to find a match from a local woman just two months later. She underwent the -hour operation in December .

One bride has reportedly come up with her own solution for this - but not everyoneaposs impressed with her method. The bride-to-beaposs sister has taken to Reddit to asksheaposs in the wrong for refusing to RSVP to the big day, as she has to apply for a spot at the wedding. She wrote: Am I the a**hole for refusing to RSVP to my sister’s wedding because I’m required to write an aposapplication essayapos just to attend My sister is getting married next February, destination wedding no less.Because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they’re cutting capacity by half.As a result she’s sending out aposre-invitesapos that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she’s asking all confirmed guests to submit two -word aposessaysapos to two questions.The gist is that they’ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people’s enthusiasm. People who don’t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualied. Well, thataposs one way to do it...  The sister went on to say that she feels really insulted that she has to compete for an invite and thinks that her sibling just wants people to kiss a**. She claims the two essay questions are aposwhy do you still want to celebrate this day with us apos and aposwhat will attending our wedding mean to you specically apos She added: I told her in advance I’m not writing  words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets hotels, and buy her a present.This has really rubbed her and my parents the wrong way. She’s said that to keep things fairI don’t fill out the RSVP correctly I won’t be saved a spot. I said fine with me. Then my parents saidI don’t show up I’m going to be in big f***ing trouble with all our relatives so just write the essays.

In a video to their , subscribers on YouTube, Eve explained: Mum and I are getting prepped early for Christmas this year by hitting the toy sales. We’ve already had the kids sit down and go through the catalogues once, now we’re having them look through them again and making their list for Christmas. Jeni added: So what the kids are doing at the moment is they are having a look through some catalogues of the mid-year toy sales and they’re deciding what they might like for Christmas this year. There are strict rules when it comes to picking toys, as kids say they’ve been taught to choose carefully and not be greedy and just because it’s on the list it doesn’t mean theyaposre getting everything on the list.” She continued: Middle of the year there’s always a big toy sale on, most of the shops will run end of the financial year sales, or some sort of toy sale.So this is where we’re going to save money and get organised well ahead of time. The kids have given us a list, we’re going to head into the shop and see what we can organise. We’ll probably put them onto Laybuys so we’ve got a long time to pay them off.

The Hurtigruten expedition ship is currently quarantined with  crew members aboard off the coast of northern Norway. Hundreds more passengers who left the MS Roald Amundsen are now being traced, after four crew members tested positive for Covid- - without initially having any symptoms. The -passenger Norwegian ship is currently docked off the coast of Tromso, after it had to cut short its sailing to the remote islands of Svalbard. Hurtigrutenaposs headquarters said the ship is isolated with  crew members aboard. The company is helping Norwegian health authorities contact  guests from the cruise ending on Friday, and another  guests from a sailing ending July . All sailings will be cancelled from now until September, the line added. It will be a blow to the company whose brand new aposstate of the artapos eco-conscious vessel  is less than a year old, and had only recently been allowed to resume sailings. It was carrying tourists to the remote archipelago between mainland Norway and the North Pole famed for its polar bears, as the country eased restrictions for domestic travel. The Roald Amundsenaposs packages start at nearly £, to more than £, for longer -day sailings that include options for Arctic, Antarctica, South and Central Americas expeditions.  The luxury vesselaposs outdoor upper decks feature a stunning infinity pool and hot tubs, and it boasts three Nordic-themed restaurants aboard. Passengers can take yoga classes on their scenic journeys. Cabins are decorated in a classic Scandinavian aesthetic, and many include outdoor balconies and private hot tubs. It features an outdoor observation deck for tourists to spot wildle, like polar bears and walruses on icy Svalbardaposs shores, and whales and penguins in Antarctica. Its two polar cruise options include stops in Antarctica, Patagonia and the Chilean fjords and Falklands. The vessel also has tours to Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama and the Central American Pacic coastline, which include monkey, turtle, dolphin and sloth spotting.  It also features an interactive science centre on board so visitors can learn more about environment and wildle and polar waters. The latest outbreak is among the first after cruise liners around the world became stranded floating prisons with hundreds stuck aboard in the early stages of the pandemic. Passengers died aboard some vessels, as passengers and crew became marooned amid their journeys while the crisis began grounding flights and stoking travel chaos internationally. The crisis led countries including the United States to declare cruises off-limits for citizens early in the crisis, as the liners were deemed particularly vulnerable to the virusapos spread.  The pandemic has threatened  cruise operators globally, with some lines have already been forced to close as the crisis continues to devastate the travel industry. A statement from Hurtigruten said: The four crew members were isolated several days ago because of other disease symptoms, with no symptoms of Covid-. They were still routinely tested when the ship docked in Tromso Friday morning. The four crew members are now admitted in the University Hospital of North Norway .  The ship is isolated and all  crew members on board will be tested. Hurtigruten and Norwegian health authorities is in the process of contacting all  guests from the cruise ending on July  and all  guests from the cruise ending on July . The safety of our guests and crews is Hurtigruten’s highest priority. We are working closely with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health , Tromsø municipality, UNN and other resources both locally and nationally, Hurtigrutenaposs Global Communications Vice President Rune Thomas Ege added. Hurtigruten has implemented strict hygiene measures on all ships during the Coronavirus pandemic.

However, it’s also a chance to lay down a marker.Grab a positive result there and the Dark Blues head into two home games on the bounce with Morton and newly-promoted Raith Rovers coming to town before the end of October – an opportunity to get off to a flying start.On the back of a trip to face Ayr, Dundee play Dick Campbell’s Arbroath at Dens before a Highlands clash with Inverness and then facing a Dunfermline side that has strengthened well over the past few weeks.After a Boxing Day trip to Dumfries, it’s the only midweek fixture of the campaign – home to Alloa – four days before hosting Hearts in what’s likely to be one of the biggest matches of the calendar for the Dens men.With only  of the  matches before the turn of the year, getting  off to a strong start will be essential to any promotion bid.That’s where the fixture list looks to be in Dundee’s favour – successive home games against the Jambos, Ayr and Inverness with trips to Raith and Arbroath in between.That run from the start of the year through to March’sto Tynecastle will be the key to success for James McPake and his men before heading into the final eight matches.The Dark Blues won’t be too happy with the card they’ve been dealt by the SPFL but defiance in the face of adversity is a trait at Dens Park.And come the final day on a Friday night at Queen of the South, the players will still fancy they can finish up on top and get the club back to the big time – eventhey have to do it the hard way.A full fixture list can be found here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I know it’s football and things change and players move on but it doesn’t stop you being sentimental.“Jamie probably should have played at a higher level during his career, but I’ve been lucky to have him and Peterhead have been lucky to have him.“Trying to replace guys like Jamie is the really hard part of management.“He can play a number of dferent positions. The last couple of seasons he’s excelled at right-back but he’s been great for us further forward as well.“Jamie’s  now and he’s started to pick up a few more injuries and it takes longer to recover.“That’s maybe partly to do with the travelling he was putting in to play for us and also his job driving lorries.“I think he feels it’s better to be closer to home to allow himself a better chance to balance work and football. But that doesn’t stop it being sad. I’ve got lots of good memories with Jamie, he’s a great guy and a great professional.”Leitch, , joined the Blue Toon in  and has been a regular over the last three seasons.His double at Hampden against Queen’s Park on the final day of the - campaign secured the League Two title.McInally added: “He was a massive part of that league winning team, he stepped up during that run-in.“He’s been a great player for us over the last three seasons. He’s got a brilliant attitude and he’s a brilliant professional.“He’s a technical player, but I think during his time with us he’s added an incredible work-rate to his game.”Boyle – another of the  title winners – joined two years ago, but has a new career outside of football.On the -year-old, McInally said: “Paddy’s graduated from university and he’s going to be a PE teacher so he won’t have the time to get to training and give us the time that’s required.“Last season especially I thought Paddy had a great season. Defensively he was really good and he’s another good guy and good professional.”Eadie, , has spent two years at Balmoor, while Ferguson, , and Hooper, , arrived last summer.McInally believes all three have good futures ahead of them and said: “They will all be a big loss, but I’m sure they’ll do well where.”Peterhead manager Jim McInally is pleased to have signed defender Gary MacKenzie and striker Isaac Layne.MacKenzie has turned out for Rangers, Dundee Blackpool, MK Dons, Bradford, Doncaster and Notts County during his career and joins the Blue Toon after leaving Premiership St Mirren.The -year-old has also twice been called up to Scotland squads and McInally said: “Gary speaks for himself really in terms of his ability. He’s been in Scotland squads.“Hopefully he can help us along a bit with his experience and help our younger defenders.“He’s got a big role to play in more ways than one.”Layne joins the Buchan outfit after hitting nine goals for fellow League One side Dumbarton last term.The -year-old Englishman has also played for Stranraer, Brechin City, Alloa and Stirling Albion.McInally added: “He’s always been hard work to play against because of his strength and power, he’s got that in abundance.“He’s still improving and we saw that last season.“He’s dferent to strikers we’ve had before and I felt we needed his attributes.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

The past few months have reminded us of what really matters our health. We all have things we’d like to improve, whether that’s losing weight or getting more physically active. Here is some advice on how to take advantage of the great outdoors and get the whole family fit this summer.The summer months offer us all the perfect opportunity to make changes to improve our mental and physical health. Getting active is good for your body and mind, and there are lots of easy ways to get active. Taking a brisk walk every day will help shed the pounds, but there is nothing better than heading out into the great outdoors to take in some of the wonderful countryside and coastal sites close to home. There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy, and here we are, face to face, learning about it and discovering things together, then there is nothing more inspiring than engaging with a nine or -year-old.\"Chris Lloyds Humanimalbook event will be

countywide measures to make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.As well as the roadside cycle route, the speed limit on Edinburgh Road, which is normally mph, will be reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The plan for the cycle path has seen dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, move across to the other side of the road.The stones are a symbol of hope and unity during the Covid- crisis, and many similar displays have been created throughout East Lothian and

councilrsquos Local Review Body overturned the refusal on appeal after councillors ruled the proposal was better than leaving the building to fall into disrepair.And they questioned whether the design of the new property, which featured extensive glass frontage to let in light, would, in fact, make the amenity more acceptable.Planning officers had estimated the new one-bedroom property would offer just nine square metres of living space in the proposed kitchen living area.The review body was told that there was no set standard for amenity and outlook when it came to conversions like the one put forward for the building, on the townrsquos Lamer Street.Instead, Leigh Taylor, council planning advisor, said it was down to the inidual officer involved.He said: ldquoThere is no exact standard, it is a judgement that has to be made by each case officer.ldquoIn this case, despite the entire east facebeing entirely glazed, it was judged there would not be sufficient outlook and amenity for the

a point they said was made to planners at the time of the original application.In a statement to the review body, they said: ldquoWe made the point that the proposal includes a balcony and ground to the rear for amenity. The site is also opposite the beach.Councillor Sue Kempson, review body member and ward councillor, said she believedit was important to see the building used for a new purpose and did not feel the lack of amenity was a problem, adding: ldquoNot everyone wants a garden.Fellow member Councillor Neil Gilbert agreed, adding: ldquoA building like this, the longer it is left the more it deteriorates. It has to find a new purpose.Councillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairman and ward member, also upheld the appeal.He said: ldquoIt has to have another use either as commercial or residential and I think residential is a good fit for this building.

Trump which donrsquot meet basic standards.Though it seems currently that this is simply a constitutional argument, it is important that we realise the threat that this presents to our trade going

independence and is visiting Scotland to repair broken relationships as a result, but the Scottish people have had their eyes opened and seen the dangers of trusting a Tory Government.The coronavirus pandemic has proven their values, and we deserve a government that prioritises its people and their safety.I welcome the reopening of beauty salons and hairdressers and I know that this will be a

Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort.

Wild camping has been enjoyed for years and enjoyed by those wanting to get closer to our land.ldquoBut whilst access to the land runs deep it must not be abused.ldquoFarmers have rights most especially, but so does our natural environment, which is there to be cherished not trashed.ldquoThose enjoying the outdoors must respect the right to do that or face consequences.ldquoPublic agencies are under pressure but enforcement is necessary.ldquoWe all have a duty to call this behaviour out.

Surely he has a computer and knows how to use it.Linda Owen said: ldquoIt has been said that him and his we were showing symptoms and thatrsquos why he was taking the kid, all the more reason to make other arrangement for the kid to be picked up.ldquoBut as I said should not have happened.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Yet the rules, as well as being unwritten, are fluid. Mr Major himself threatened to take Boris Johnson to court for proroguing parliament.Tony Blair has fast become the past premier most likely to pop up with ldquohelpful advice, as he showed on Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday.With the BBC Sunday programmes now on their summer hols, presenter Sophy Ridge made the most of being the only show in town, breezing straight in on the dayrsquos big story ndash the sudden imposition of a fortnightrsquos quarantine for holidaymakers ing from Spain.

I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

The latter seems unlikely given how busy he seems to be with the modestly titled Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. Its latest position paper, Learning to Live Alongside Covid-, was ostensibly the reason for his latest appearance.It was a wide-ranging interview covering everything from Russia and China to Scottish independence. You can read what he had to say in full where in the paper, but in summary: Boris Johnson was uselessScottish Labour had been uselessand current Labour leader Keir Starmer was proving usefulIt was fairly predictable stuff for the former Prime Minister, except for the end when Ridge asked why he could not seem to wrench himself away from politics. Isnrsquot it time to take a break, she wondered, go round the golf course or to the shepherdrsquos hut  David Cameron famously opted for the latter, spending a cool pound, on one for his Cotswolds garden.Mr Blair seemed momentarily taken aback. ldquoItrsquos not something I want to do. A lot of people might think thatrsquos exactly what he should do, stop talking about things. But I care about the country, I think we are at a huge moment of change in the world.Addressing the elephant backseat passenger in the room, he went on: ldquoIrsquove tried to do something that previous prime ministers have not done, but in the future I predict that many more will try and do because you leave office when yoursquove still got a lot of years of active working le.ldquoI always say to peopleyou donrsquot want to listen to me itrsquos a free world, donrsquot bother.\"But Irsquom not going to be playing rounds of golf or sitting twiddling my thumbs.

In second film Disorder, the subject under the microscope is Post-traumatic Stress Disorder . Winocour suffered PTSD after the dficult birth of her daughter, but in her film she inflicts it not a new mother but on a black-suited army veteran-turned-bodyguard who finds himself having to deal with a violent home invasion in order to protect the family of his wealthy employer.Starring Matthias Schoenaerts, Disorder featured in the Cannes Film Festivalrsquos prestigious Un Certain Regard strand and during the extensive research and writing process she and Schoenaerts worked closely with a soldier who had suffered PTSD. ldquoHe became almost like a brother, says Winocour over a Zoom call from her home in Paris. ldquoOf course Irsquove never been Afghanistan, Irsquove never been to war, but PTSD is like being close to death so I had been as exposed as him, as close to death. Whatrsquos exciting to me about cinema is discovering a world you donrsquot know, but also discovering yourself. Her other notable film credit is as a co-writer on Mustang, the debut feature by France-based director Deniz Gamze Erguumlven and a searing broadside against the treatment of girls and women in Erguumlvenrsquos native Turkey. It won her a Ceacutesar award, the French equivalent of an Oscar.Winocourrsquos third film as director is Proxima. In some ways itrsquos a follow-on from Disorder in that it deals with a working single mother trying to balance her career with the needs of her young daughter. The dference is that Sarah, the mother in question, is an astronaut with the European Space Agency and the big break she is handed at the start of the film is a place on a y mission to the International Space Station. It will in turn lay the scientic groundwork for a crewed mission to Mars. The name of the mission: ProximaTim Burton regular Eva Green, currently starring in The Luminaries on television, plays Sarah. Newcomer Zeacutelie Boulant-Lemesle is Stella, the eight-year-old daughter Sarah is forced to leave in the hands of her ex-partner Thomas , a gentle German astrophysicist working for the European Space Agencyat its facilities in Darmstadt and Cologne. His speciality is Venus .Starring alongside Green are Matt Dillon, as macho American astronaut Mike, and Aleksey Fateev, as Russian cosmonaut Anton. Along with Sarah they will form the three-strong launch crew, thoughtherersquos equality in space therersquos little on the ground: Mike appears suspicious of Sarahrsquos ability and evokes a furious response from her when he suggests she have a lighter training schedule than the men. But from those dficult beginnings the relationship thaws and, as she does with the character of Thomas, Winocour shows the complexity and vulnerability beneath Mikersquos male bluster. Dillon, twinkle-eyed but every-so-slightly smarmy, is perfect for the role.ldquoEvery time itrsquos the same thing ndash Irsquom attracted to a world and then I realise while Irsquom writing what drove me to it, says Winocour, explaining the starting point for Proxima. ldquoThis one was just a world I wanted to discover, and I came up with this idea of a character, a female astronaut, and I thought it was an interesting character because this idea of separation from the earth, which every astronaut has to experience, could resonate with a personal story of separation from a daughter. It was those two levels that were critical to me.Much of the filming took place on location at Star City, the centre near Moscow which has trained cosmonauts since the s and where Winocour and her crew were surrounded by real astronauts, and at Baikonaur, a cosmodrome in the steppes of Kazakhstan where ESA launches take place. Winocour was able to film several. ldquoItrsquos an intense experience. Itrsquos exhilarating and at the same time really frightening, she says. ldquoI canrsquot imagine how it is when itrsquos your own mother, or when yoursquore a child.One thing Proxima is not, however, is a science fiction film. Personal tensions rise between Sarah and her colleagues and, as in Disorder, Winocour shows she isnrsquot afraid of an action sequence ndash there are some heart-in-the-mouth scenes in which a space-suited Sarah practises rescue scenarios underwater and against the clock, or pushes herself to near le-threatening levels of pressure in the spinning centruge. The drama, though, stays almost entirely earthbound.ldquoThe real thing I wanted to talk about was the relationship between a mother and daughter, says Winocour. ldquoI had travelled a lot for the promotion of my films, and for the shooting I had been away for a long time and felt guilty about it. I wanted to explore this relationship because I have a daughter whorsquos the same age as the daughter in the film. I felt more comfortable to talk about this very intimate thing in a very unknown world, or through something very far away from me. In French cinema a lot of people have a kind of autobiographical way of telling stories, but to me the more it is intimate, the more it has to be far away.Would she say, then, that Proxima is her most personal film to date ldquoAll of my films are very personal. Disorder was very intimate. It was about PTSD, which I had experienced myself hellip It was giving birth to my daughter. I almost died because I had a very serious illness, and also my daughter almost died from it. So I spent a lot of time in the hospital. I guess this film also is probably inspired by that story because of course itrsquos about separation. Because of that illness, we were separated too early.Proximarsquos closing titles are intercut with photographs of the great many women of all nationalities who have gone into space, mostly pictured with the families they either left behind or were about to say goodbye to. As is typical, Winocourrsquos research for Proxima was extensive, a two-year period in which she travelled regularly to the ESA centre in Cologne. During it she interviewed most of those female astronauts. ldquoThere were many dferent point of views, but all of them said that being an astronaut was harder for women than for men.In one scene, Sarah is asked by a medic whether she intends to continue to menstruate while on board the ISS. She says she does and in reply is informed that tampons will be added to her equipment but their weight deducted from whatever passes for personal baggage allowance. Itrsquos a brief scene but one with importance for Winocour. ldquoItrsquos something I donrsquot see much in films, she says. ldquoI think itrsquos a very important part of the le of women, having periods, but itrsquos something wersquore told to remain silent about. I think itrsquos time cinema should break that silence.An intense, personal drama with thrilling interludes and an almost documentary feel at points, Proxima draws powerful performances from both Green and Boulant-Lemesle, but it ends on a note of symbolism and redemption.ldquoSociety makes you think that as a woman you have to choose between your personal le and having children and having a career, says Winocour. ldquoI think thatrsquos a question thatrsquos in the film: as a mother, do you have to try to be perfect, the person your mother or grandmother told you that you should be  Or is it more important to think that being a good mother is showing that whatrsquos important in le is following your dreams and doing what you were made for  I think the film gives the answer. Itrsquos a story of liberation because the mother goes for the dream.Proxima is released on July "},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-blythman-pick-perfect-pot","story":"Andrewrsquos advice was to treat each pot and pan you use as an investment item. Enduring, well-designed cooking kit is generally pretty expensive, so keep your collection lean, build it up gradually, and go for the best you can afford at the time. Cheap fixes are a waste of time and ultimately money, he warned. Plastic handles, for instance, are a no-no: itrsquos only a matter of time until they they break off. Choose steel handles instead. Apart from anything they give you the option of starting off something on the hob ndash a thick fish like cod or duck breast, for instance, then finishing it off in the oven, all using just one pan.Stainless steel pots are useless for anything other than boiling unless they have a thick aluminium , alloy, or copperlsquosandwichrsquo between the layers of steel at the base food sticks to them otherwise. Yoursquoll know the sandwich is thick enough by the weight of the pot heavier is better. Non-stick ndash those light metal pots and pans with a black coating ndash can scratch and flake toxins into your food almost the minute you use them. Steer well clear.Over the years I have built up my collection following Andrewrsquos principles, but experimenting with newer technology as it appears. What works for you is an inidual thing, and for most of us there will always be competing factors: design, , weight, and ease of maintenance. So here are a few of my star acquisitions.For indestructible pots, I wouldnrsquot look past Le Pentole, a time-honoured brand that is made in Italy. Their stainless steel pans have great lids that fit snugly on the rim, and solid aluminium, steel and alloy bases that conduct heat evenly. Theyrsquore pricey ndash upwards of pound for a milk pan ndash but on the bright side, seem to be cheaper than they used to be.I cherish my old Le Pentole frypan, although you need to give it time for the base to heat up gentlyto have it perform at its non-adherent best. Yet ever since I discovered the skillets made by Netherton Foundry in Shropshire, it has taken a back seat. Netherton Foundryrsquos spun iron frying pans are miraculous: sleek, light in the hand, they come already ldquoseasoned\" at very high temperatures with flax oil, so theyrsquore non-stick without any chemical coating. Even egg doesnrsquot stick.The only issue is that Nethertonrsquos pans canrsquot go in the dishwasher. All I do is wash mine in hot water ndash soap would spoil their surface ndash and dry them off, either with a tea towel, or better still, on a low flame for a few minutes. A big  cm skillet costs around pound, a bargain for something that will last foreveryou look after it, and give you pleasure every time you use it.Irsquove toured the immortal Le Creuset factory at St Quentin in northern France where they make the real deal, enamel-coated cast iron cookware. Their casseroles weigh a ton, cost a frightening amount ndash around pound for a large one ndash gradually lose their enamel surface, but even so, for a melting stew, theyrsquore peerless. Le Creuset gratin dishes, with their time-honoured designs, are hard to beat too.And finally, after years of struggling with a cumbersome, deep-sided steel roasting pan Irsquom a convert to the cheap, lightweight, enamel-covered tin equivalent from Falconware. This nostalgic blue-rimmed brand loses its heat almost instantly, which makes it easy to handle from the oven. It roasts potatoes, or vegetables, producing those highly desirable crusty brown extremities, especiallyyou line it with baking parchment. It comes up a treat in the dishwasher. One large enough to take a plump chicken and veg recently cost me pound. Something highly effective, but cheap. How wonderful!"},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  We can all help regenerate Scotland  39 s wild lands","story":"The guilt many of us feel for the part wersquove played in environmental calamity can be paralysing. Therersquos a general acceptance that, rather than sharing culpability with previous generations, we are the ones at whose door it can be laid. Obviously there is a lot of truth in that, as we continue to consume oceans of gas and oil, and despoil the seas with plastic. Yet the culprits for harming nature and tipping it out of kilter can be found in centuries past as well as in the international departure lounges of our airports. We should not shoulder all the blame.Irsquom thinking, as one example in my own backyard, of James V. For all his qualities as a leader he was never as impressive as his father James IV, or even his daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Quite apart from his military deficiencies at the Battle of Solway Moss, James V is the man who introduced , sheep into the Ettrick Valley, to raise money for his ambitious plans. In so doing, he destroyed the ancient Ettrick Forest, in which he and other royals had hunted and killed stags by the barrowload. The kingrsquos flocks arrived a some point after , and it did not take them long to strip the valley of its trees. By our own times, all that was left of this magnicent haven for wildle was a handful of thorn trees and birches. The rest is empty scrubland.I learned about this vandalous act in a newly published collection of essays called A Journey in Landscape Restoration: Carrran Wildwood and Beyond, edited by the biologists Philip and Myrtle Ashmole. Unlike most of the books I read this is not about the past, but about the future. There are almost as many photos as words, but the ones that most vividly illustrate the tale are those taken of the Carrran Valley, in the hills near Moffat.At the end of last century, this was a bleak expanse of severely depleted upland, grazed almost to extinction. A winter photo from  shows it as a dreary unrelieved desert: think of a chocolate brownie and yoursquod be close, though dusted with snow rather than icing sugar. Now, after  years of dedicated work by volunteers, it is growing lush once more. Swathes of native woodland clothe the hillsides, and its increasingly rich undergrowth is attracting an abundance of birds, insects, flowers, fungi and amphibians. The range of moths alone is heart-warming. As before and after images go, the dference could hardly be more striking.Previously you would have been lucky to hear much more than a grouse cackling, or watch a buzzard circling overhead now it is like the RSNO, as a sorts of birdle, from meadow pippits to willow warblers, wrens and winchats, strike up from the branches of native trees: birch, aspen, ash, oak, willow, rowan, hazel, Scots pine and juniper.In a series of pithy pieces,  of those who helped bring about this transformation describe how they went about it. Philip Ashmole originally had the idea to recreate an area of woodland in the Borders that replicated how it would have been before humans arrived. Out of this notion the Wildwood Group was established, which later formed itself into the Borders Forest Trust. On Millennium Day, the trust took ownership of the Carrran Valley, and set to work on creating a wildwood.In subsequent years, other ecological restoration schemes were also begun, at Corehead and Devilrsquos Beef Tub, and Talla and Gameshope. Together these groundbreaking ventures began to restore an area they have named The Wild Heart of Southern Scotland. Inspired by their example, others are now following their lead across the country.Living as I do in one of the great medieval sheep rearing districts of the Borders, in the vicinity of Melrose Abbey, itrsquos not hard to see the effect  and more years of grazing have had on the landscape. As one of the contributors to this book writes, sheep are engrained in our economy and culture, and they are the main reason, along with other herbivores such as voles, deer, goats and rabbits, why native woodland planting is rare: ldquoItrsquos no mystery: sheep eat trees. As flocks expanded, their predators ndash wolves and lynx ndash were killed, so that today other grazers, and especially deer, roam and breed without any natural check.The Borders Forest Trustrsquos vision was aided by bodies like the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, but its core remained a motivated army of volunteers. Many of these came with scientic credentials ndash geographers, botanists, ornithologists, ecologists and such like. Others were simply determined to help re-establish wilderness in barren terrain. One weekend last autumn,  members of the Glasgow branch of Extinction Rebellion arrived at Gameshope, and in two days helped plant , trees. In the words of Anna Craigen, the trustrsquos work would been impossible without volunteers: ldquoThey are our muscles, brains, eyes, dirty hands and the true heart of the Wild Heart.What is so uplting about this story is not just the determination and imagination of those who have made all this happen, but the tangible evidence of the regeneration they have promoted. Page after page of A Journey in Landscape Restoration is filled with photos of wildle now thriving in Carrran.Amid the bad news headlines about climate change, and images of bush fires, floods and landslides, it is good to be reminded of the things being done to turn the tide. Work such as that in Carrran Wildwood not only restores nature to its rightful state, but gives a terric boost to our own depleted sense of hope.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Far, far too fast for me and I felt the bile rising and my breathing quickening and panicking.Everything would be packed and taken with me.Bugger, I immediately thought of my lsquosparersquo sponge bag overflowing with the forbidden used nicotine containers from my electronic cigs. They had to be ditched but couldnrsquot be simply off-loaded in the room waste bin.And the unopened ones had to be carefully concealed until Irsquod scanned the lay of the land of my new quarters.God knows how I was going to nurse my wrecked phone and explain its importance all over again to unsympathetic healers of the body not the spirit.Again, the bile rose as I thought of being unable to connect beyond my French bed, left with even more thoughts running marathons around my head. No, no, no, no, no.Yet, at this time, I wanted no connection to friends ndash no explanation, no threat of tears destroying my fragile composure. The continuing pats and strokes from the aides were disturbing enough.Instead I sent the despised round robin ndash cold, brief and to the point of what was more than suspected and said wersquod talk when I could. That was all ndash kind words and sympathy might make it real and I couldnrsquot have that intruding on my nightmare.No, I needed practical, pragmatic Miriam ndash she of sound action and scepticism where all medical matters were concerned. Someone who held out neither  promises, hopes and what s but concentrated on the here and now and what was needed she could provide.And so, I sat as her capable hands ided my perfectly washed and pressedhospital wardrobe into small bag for the hopefully short days of tests and case to house the rest.Even my underwear was piled in order, not scrunched into corners in my fashion. Pride in her work was evident in every sorted pile and I took my own calming pleasure from watching her, almost mesmerised by the lucidity of her movements.The nicotine cases shersquod so cleverly smuggled in were found and tipped into small plastic bags for home disposal fresh ones removed from packs to take up the smallest space sweet papers, old tissues, half empty cream tubes removed and pegs put on them to squeeze their last remnants. Empty medicine packets Irsquod left to one side on removing the contents, were crushed into cubes and disposed plastic bags pleated over and over again for re-use.In the end, as perfect as a conciergersquos display, my two bags lay ready for collection. An empty large paper carrier bag awaited my toiletries and night clothes. All I had to add was the triple adapter and clutch tight to my computer and phone.A box had been provided for the phone to fit it snugly, nestled in strong tissues. I just had to pray that the battery which drains within minutes would kick-start.For her remaining time, she discussed the puny size of this yearrsquos crops of sunflowers stunted by lack of water the suffocating  degree heat wersquore seeing in the shade skimmed lightly over the future arrival of my son Piercethe borders were closed.She talked of the hours making her conserves and her  pots of ratatouille and reconfirmed her vow not to travel beyond kms until the virus had been totally eliminated world-wide.Her actions and words poured over me ndash soothing, comforting, timeless and took me for a while far from my troubles and fears.I doubt that was deliberate on her part. Once again, she was simply Miriam accepting of the task in front of her, not rushing ahead to meet ones that may or may not come.And once again after she left, I uttered a heartfelt thanks for her friendship and presence.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It will encourage companies, start-ups and spin-outs to look at value chains and other opportunities for the production of renewable biological resources, and their conversion into everyday products, that will help to contribute to a cleaner, greener and more sustainable future for all.It will bring together academia and industry to research, develop and deploy novel high-tech approaches to the conversion of biomass and waste streams into value-added products and applications.Focusing on six value chains that will play a key role in the growth of the bioeconomy ndash whisky co-products, marine biomass, agricultural biomass, municipal solid wastes and food processing by-products and waste, forestry biomass and carbon capture ndash the Bioeconomy Cluster Builder project will look to bring benefits to companies to support NetZero in the form of improved sustainability, increased efficiency and superior product performance.Repurposing traditional lsquowaste productsrsquo is a great use of IB. One industryrsquos waste is another industryrsquos gold. We are already seeing some innovative products being developed by some of our members using bio-technology to repurpose waste from industrial and agricultural processes. The sources and uses are wide-ranging, the likes of salmon feed can be made from algae grown on whisky co-products to reduce carbon emissions.IBioIC has over  member organisations, working across Scotland, the UK and Europe to find innovative solutions to modern problems. Our industry members range from medical biotechnology companies working on protein production through to those developing green solutions in bioenergy and biofuel, that utilise agriculture, marine and forestry derived materials. The projects IBioIC help to deliver are as erse as taking waste from shellfish and using it to develop sustainable, biodegradable packaging, to fermenting sugar in bioprocesses for the production of high value products like pharmaceuticals and sustainable materials.The key promise of a bio-based economy is that we can grow the sources of raw materials for every day products. Now is the time for Scotland to harness the full potential of biotechnology by investing in companies that will provide solutions, for both the environment and the economy, and for the next generation.Mark Bustard is CEO at Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre "},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-covid-must-catalyst-education-opportunity","story":"As we slowly emerge from lockdown and begin to transition back to a semblance of pre-Covid  society, it is now critical that we keep the spotlight on this agenda and resist placing the needs of autistic children at the bottom of what is becoming an increasingly growing national lsquoTo Dorsquo list.A recently released study by Dr Chris Papadopoulos from Bedfordshirersquos Institute for Health Research, Dr Georgia Pavlopoulou of University College London, and Dr Rebecca Wood from University of East London outlined how the coronavirus lockdown impacted on families of autistic children and young people.It found, perhaps unsurprisingly, % of family carers reported a change to their daily routine. More importantly, it reported that % of parents of autistic children felt lack of government support during lockdown but with many stating they did not want ato the pre-Covid world.This position is entirely understandable in light of the many issues and challenges autistic children and their families face including unlawful exclusion from school. Our campaign research helped shine a light on the very human cost of this practice which includes high levels of stress and anxiety among children and their families as well as the economic disadvantages this creates for them, these have been particularly felt during lockdown when many parents were left without any form of support.The Not Included, Not Engaged, Not involved campaign showed that, for many autistic learners, current education provision is far from ideal. With that in mind, we should consider the opportunities for alternative learning presented by the global pandemic rather than this being a time to regress and put much-needed progress on the backburner, we need to use it as a catalyst for change. We need to listen to families with autistic children and do things dferently and better when it comes to providing education.It is not enough to tinker at the edges ndash transformation and systemic change are required. We need to seize this moment and be more inclusive by working with autistic children, their parents and other supportive allies in achieving this outcome.Considering the phenomenal and ongoing efforts being made to get Scotlandrsquos children back to school next month, now is the time to put an end to the frustrating and often siloed thinking in how education policies are determined and budgets are allocated. While investment into resources, support materials, and technology is hugely welcome, this will only take us so far. Providing mainstream education opportunities for autistic children requires people ndash well trained people ndash and this requires adequate and sustained financial resources.We also need to see cultural change with recognition that there is a real threat to the mental health and wellbeing of autistic childrenwe fail to enable genuine inclusivity and acceptance. Autistic learners are best placed to judge when andthat is achieved. While government policy supports inclusion, implementation, all too often, does not. True inclusion must be seamless so it can be felt.The situation demands that we think beyond transition to transformation and make our schools and other services a place where they can feel included, engaged, involved and safe.Charlene Tait, Deputy CEO at Scottish Autism"},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-dave-allan-tidying-soft-fruit-harvest","story":"Nature can always get on without our help.A self-sown blackcurrant quite near our fruitcage is left to its own devices and thrives magnicently, spreading metres in every direction. I even have to trim some branches back from a burnside path. Like all our bushes this year, it was laden with fruit.But the berries were tiny, unlike the plump ones on its cultivated parent or the long, burgeoning strings on our ancient, th century redcurrant at the bottom of the garden.Regular pruning over the years has paid idends and kept us well supplied with delicious redcurrant wine.For starters, keeping a bush healthy is vital. Whatever the age or type of plant, the first step is to remove dying and poorly fruiting branches.And be sure to give strawberries a good haircut ndash no lockdown restrictions here. Use secateurs to remove all this yearrsquos foliage and old fruiting stems, leaving a bare -cm high crown. Fresh leaves emerge within a week or two -ndash promise!You also ensure good health by keeping fruit bushes well-shaped. So remove spindly little branches emerging in the centre. Aim for a goblet design, with  or  main branches forming a perimeter round an open centre.But keep an eye out for stronger young branches that yoursquoll need to replace old ones.Let a newcomer grow on for a year or two before making the change.Remove any inward-facing stems. And since the main branches should be fan-shaped, remove any crossing and touching stems. Shorten branch and stemby up to one third, particularly those growing downwards.Fresh stems from the base of trained cordon and fan-shaped fruit should also be removed, and prune to maintain the basic shape. With fans, cut back laterals to the desiredand similarly with cordons.Redcurrants and gooseberries fruit on mature wood, so the more of that you remove, the smaller next yearrsquos crop will beBlackcurrants fruit on one year old as well as mature wood, so remove two thirds of older branches to allow for a larger proportion of fresh ones.For a good crop, always retain one third of the mature wood.The raspberry family, including loganberries, Tayberries and the rest, behave quite dferently and, with the exception of autumn raspberries, only fruit on fresh canes or branches. So cut all fruited stems down to ground level.With rasps, aim for six of the strongest stems for next year. So, to ensure against any possible winter damage, select the eight or nine strongest ones, loosely tying them to the wires.Autumn raspberries are pruned at the end of winter, harvesting from fresh canes.When removing old canes in February, you could retain two or three and they would produce fruit in summer.This is possibleyoursquore limited for space. Otherwise, grow both types of plant and remove all fruited canes annually.With bush raspberries, cut out all the old stems to prevent congestion: thriving plants produce a prodigious young forest every year and that too needs thinning.And never clip soft fruit bushes like a hedge or simply shorten raspberry canes.To my horror, someone I know did this to an autumn iety one summer and wondered why she had no crop.Late summer early autumn pruning helps maintain healthy, well-shaped plants and while it improves the quality of next yearrsquos harvest, you get larger gooseberries by shortening fruiting spurs in early spring.But a few soft fruit bushes, like blueberries need virtually no pruning.Plant of the weekHyssop, Hyssopus officinalis, bears deep blue flowers with prominent stamens that are attractive to all sorts of bees. The aromatic foliage has culinary uses.

Such entitled arrogance was typied this week by the hysterical and childish Twitter response of Humza Yousaf, alumnus of Hutchesonsrsquo Grammar in Glasgow, to reasonable criticism of his sinister and incoherent Hate Crime bill.Research conducted by The Herald in  showed that MSPs were five times more likely than the average Scot to be privately educated. Among the rest, the triumph of party hacks and the professional middle-classes is dismally apparent.Nowhere is the dread hand of middle-class complacency more apparent than in the Scottish Government. The SNP cabinet reads like the staff register for Classic FM. Each one has a degree and several have multiple parchments, including one who seems to have been competing with Jim Murphy for the title of Scotlandrsquos student prince.Earlier this year, the academics Michael Keating and Paul Cairney in an article first published by the Centre for Constitutional Change maintained that the hegemony of the political elites at Westminster has been replicated at Holyrood. It built on general themes the pair had previously explored in a paper published in . Keating and Cairney concluded that among MSPs ldquoa common middle-class background predominated. ldquoMany such occupations ndash such as in law or education ndash were once described as politics facilitating because they offered the skills or connections conducive to seeking election.Their observations reflected research conducted by University College London in  that examined the policy preferences of working-class and career politicians within the Labour Party both before and during Tony Blairs tenure as leader. It showed that working-class MPs were much more in favour of traditional welfare policies than their careerist colleagues. This had contributed greatly during the Blair era towards more centrist polices around reforming welfare and a much diminished representation of working-class voters interests. ldquoPut bluntly, said the reportrsquos author, ldquocareerist MPs are much more likely to blow with the political winds.The SNP, it seems, is modelling itself on Mr Blairrsquos New Labour principles. In a remarkable and detailed essay written by George Kerevan earlier this month, the former SNP politician excoriated the party for its cultivation of Big Business and a ruthless party machine driving a byzantine bureaucracy than can only be traversed by favoured acolytes and savants whorsquove been given the secret passwords.Itrsquos not now enough to have supported the SNP and fought for independence all of your adult le to be deemed fit for a party nomination. You are also expected to defer to the esoteric cult of political fetishists gaining influence in the party.Stepping into this circle is Chris McEleny, who announced on Thursday that he is seeking to become the SNPrsquos candidate in Inverclyde at next yearrsquos Scottish Parliament elections. I wish him well but I donrsquot envy him. If he emerges unscathed and successful from the partyrsquos vetting procedures the task of facing down the unionist parties will be a breeze in comparison.Mr McEleny is an authentic, working-class tradesman from Greenock who has led the SNP group on Inverclyde Council with some distinction. The SNP high command though, have made it clear they donrsquot want people like him anywhere near their salons and boutiques. Recently he was attacked ndash in adolescent manner ndash by Alyn Smith in an article that recalled Denis Healeyrsquos famous observation about Geoffrey Howe and dead sheep. Later he attracted the petulant wrath of Pete Wishart for insisting that the SNP be a little more, you know hellip pro-active in the independence department. Smith and Wishart are tame party courtiers: desperate to please the leadership less so in constructing a route towards independence.McElenyrsquos experience at the hands of party managers is broadly similar to that of Chris Stephens, another authentic, working-class activist who did more than anyone to persuade some of Scotlandrsquos trade unions to transfer their allegiances to the SNP from Labour. Yet only after more than a decade of rejection did the SNP deign to let him compete at the  election.Mr McEleny has been subjected to a campaign of intimidation and harassment carrying the stamp of the party hierarchy and carried out by an insidious pack of jackals on social media. Everything from his Catholic faith his criticism of GRA reforms his admiration for Joanna Cherry and his inconveniently persistent calls for an independence Plan B has been subject to abuse from the SNPrsquos secret police.In recent months his has been a lone voice pleading for an emergency economic aid package for Inverclyde, home to Scotlandrsquos poorest neighbourhood. Coronavirus death and infection rates in Inverclyde are three times higher than the national average and Mr McEleny has been this communityrsquos most eloquent advocate.Not possessing a degree and being a manual worker he would be an exotic creature inside the Holyrood party. And possessing such views as he does also makes him the wrong type of nationalist for the SNP in the same way that Joanna Cherry is the wrong sort of feminist.If the SNP persists with its aggressive obsession with rewriting the rules on human biology and their latest attempts to criminalise the Scottish population they will make themselves unelectable, no matter what the rosy opinion polls currently suggest. They are fast becoming the biggest threat to the prospect of an independent Scotland.

For example, global drinks giant Diageo set a target to cut its emissions by %. Operating  sites across Scotland, including  malt whisky distilleries, Diageo has invested heavily in its on-site bio-energy facilities using by-products from distillation to create anaerobic and biomass power supplies.As a whole, the whisky industry is leading the way in terms of investment and innovating in reducing its environmental impacts. The Scotch Whisky Associationreports that water efficiency in the distillation process has improved by % since , % of packaging is now made from recycled materials, and % of the industryrsquos energy now comes from renewable sources.Improving environmental sustainability isnrsquot just a moral obligation for food and drink businesses it is increasingly becoming essential to keep and attract buyers and consumers.Graham Young, Industry Development Director at Scotland Food and DrinkOne company that has realised the commercial benefits of improving its sustainability is Border Biscuits. Based in Lanarkshire, the -year-old business recently redesigned its packaging to reduce the plastic used by %.The baker estimates that the move saved  tonnes of CO equivalent emissions from the packaging manufacturing process and will reduce the number of vehicles needed to transport the products by %, making considerable cost-savings and strengthening the brandrsquos reputation as environmentally responsible.Changing the packaging and reconfiguring its manufacturing took Border Biscuits two years to complete and was part of a wider investment into its products and processes.Household names making wholesale changes to their products or processes arenrsquot the only food and drink businesses in Scotland who are leading the charge in the fight against climate change.The Crafty Pickle Co, a food fermenter based in Aberdeen was set up by founders Madi and Arthur to create delicious small-batch pickles using perfectly edible, imperfect, surplus produce.Vegetables that would otherwise end up being thrown out based on aesthetics are given a new lease of le through preserving fermentation or pickling ndash turning food waste into profit.The company estimates that . million tonnes of edible food is wasted each year with one third of food produced never leaving the farm.Wersquore blessed with a rich green countryside,plentul rainfall, rich seas and a talented workforce, all of which contribute to Scotlandrsquos already remarkably green food and drink supply.Scotland punches above its weight in terms of sustainability, particularly in meat production. According to QMS, around % of Scottish farmland is unsuitable for growing cereals and vegetables but can support beef and lamb production. Scottish beef is among the most sustainably farmed globally using low-density, grass-fed herds while Scotlandrsquos hill and upland grasslands play a substantial role in the countryrsquos carbon capture.Despite clear and signicant improvements in the environmental efficacy of the food and drink industry, there is still more that can be done across the board.Coronavirus impacts have touched every business and person in the country in myriad ways, but one positive outcome of the pandemic has been consumersrsquo support for local food and producers. Shortening supply chains and shopping local is a really simple but effective way consumers can cut CO emissions from unnecessary food miles.For producers, there is no one size fits all approach to becoming more environmentally sustainable, butwe each make incremental changes to systems and processes can have dramatic positive effects for our environment. There is a wealth of support for businesses of all shapes and sizes to adopt greener practices from organisations like SEPA and Zero Waste Scotland.As well as Scotlandrsquos natural resources, wersquore also blessed with human talent and brain power. Our scientic, research and manufacturing sectors will play a key collaborative role in driving sustainability development with our prized food and drink sector.For all the evils Coronavirus has caused, it also offers us an opportunity as an industry to re-evaluate where we are, where we want to be and how we can get there together. Environmental sustainability must be a central pillar in rebuilding our food and drink industry, strengthening our global brand and reputation, and ultimately playing our role in protecting the future of our planet. n----------------------------------------------------------Brewer pours investment into carbon reduction initiativesOne of Scotlandrsquos most famous drinks brands is going above and beyond in its drive to be carbon neutral, finds Anthony HarringtonThe pressure is ratcheting up on all companies around the world to work at lowering their carbon footprint, and Scottish businesses, by and large, are responding well. With Earth Overshoot day on  August coming ever closer, the need for companies to play their part in the drive to make Scotland a net-zero economy by  is clear.Over % of our businesses comply with environmental regulations, according to a February report from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency . This was the fourth year in a row that Scottish businesses have achieved this level of compliance.Many are going above and beyond mere compliance and are actively pushing towards becoming carbon neutral. SEPA is encouraging this through the use of what the Agency calls Sustainable Growth Agreements . These are voluntary formal agreements between SEPA and businesses that focus on practical action to deliver environmentally positive outcomes.Martin Doogan, Group Engineering Manager at CC, left, with Terry ArsquoHearn, SEPA Chief ExecutiveThe Agencyrsquos chief executive, Terry ArsquoHearn, pointed to the performance of both the Scottish Whisky industry and the brewing sector as examples of the positive impact that active sustainability initiatives can bring about across industries.ldquoWersquore pleased to recognise the exceptionally high standards of compliance from Scotlandrsquos distillers and brewers, ArsquoHearn said.Both sectors achieved a .% compliance rating, up from % the prior year.Scotlandrsquos leading brewer, the Glasgow-based Tennent Caledonian was singled out by ArsquoHearn for special praise. The brewery, founded in , received an lsquoexcellentrsquo rating for the third year in a row.Tennentrsquos has made sustainability an integral part of its business model with initiatives that have included launching a major consumer awareness campaign and becoming the first brewer in the UK to join the UK Plastics Pact, set up by WRAP, the Waste and Resources Action Programme.As part of this, the brewer has committed to phasing out shrink-wrap from its packs. Cans are being packaged in cardboard rather than using plastic rings to hold packs together. The firm has pledged to do away with all instances of single-use plastics by  and has said that it will cease using plastics altogetherby  ndash the same year that it aims to have all its energy supplied from renewable sources.Martin Doogan, Group Engineering Manager at CC , points out that the company has invested signicantly in environmental performance enhancements at its Wellpark site.This includes putting in an anaerobic digestion plant and a carbon capture facility which, he says is lsquothe biggest of its kind in Scotlandrsquo.Completing this September, it will enable the brewer to capture and store the CO that is generated as a byproduct during fermentation. The facility aims to capture and store , tonnes of CO annually. In addition, the brewer will be able to use the CO to carbonate the beer. This means it will not need to source CO externally, which it estimates will eliminate the carbon output associated with some , kilometres of road haulage.Martin Doogan said: ldquoThe installation of the new facility marks another milestone in our commitment to challenging climate change and itrsquos been fantastic seeing the tanks put into place and everything come together and we are eagerly anticipating having everything operational later in the year.There is no doubt that companies benefit from having their brands associated with sustainability and carbon reduction efforts. Consumers today are more aware than ever of the need to mitigate and slow down climate change to safeguard the future, with younger consumers showing the highest levels of awareness and concern.A lsquoFuture of Humanityrsquo survey by Amnesty International sampled the opinions of ,  to -year-oldsacross countries. Overwhelmingly, respondents cited global warming as the most important issue facing the world.More generally, Scotlandrsquos food and drinks sector already has a proud record in striving to mitigate its carbon footprint, and even to become net-negative. The Arbikie distillery on the east coast of Scotland, owned by three brothers, John, Iain, and David Stirling, recently launched what it calls the worldrsquos first lsquoclimate positiversquo gin, called Nagravedargin.Nagravedar gin is made from peas rather than from cereals, like other gins. Peas do not require synthetic nitrogen to be added to the soil to facilitate their growth, avoiding having nitrogen run-off into the waterways and soils. Instead, they benefit the ecosystem and improve soil quality. Arbikie claims that its Nagravedar gin has a carbon footprint of -.kg CO equivalent per ml bottle.All the distilleries ingredients are grown on its farm and the brothers claim a proud record in provenance and traceability for all their products. The distillery uses its own locally grown juniper and locally produced honey, along with solar power. Waste from the distilling process is recycled wherever possible as feed for cattle.Encouraging as these instances are, there is still an urgent need to do more. SEPA points out thateveryone in the world lived as we do in Scotland, wersquod consume the equivalent of the output of three Earths.ldquoAs a society, we are over-using our planetrsquos resources. In the st century and beyond, only those businesses that operate in harmony with our planet will thrive, it warns."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11648078.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fish-waste-holds-promise-rich-scottish-harvest","story":"Costing an eye-watering poundmillion, Scottish Sea Farmsrsquo new Barcaldine RAS Hatchery on the shores of Loch Creran near Oban is equipped with some impressive technologies, all with one thing in mind: sustainable food production.Minimal fresh water usage, reduced fossil fuel consumption, a wood chip biomass system and provision for its own hydro scheme ndash the environment has been considered at every turn, right down to the responsible re-use of fish waste.Scottish Sea Farmsrsquo Operations Manager for Barcaldine RAS Hatchery, Noelia Rodriguez, explained: ldquoOur fish arrive with us as tiny eggs and are hatched and raised in fresh water until they are the right size and weight for transfer to sea pens.ldquoThroughout the growing process, the hatcheryrsquos recirculating aquaculture system ndash or RAS for short ndash ensures that the fish have a continuous supply of clean, oxygenated water thatrsquos maintained at a steady temperature.During this same ongoing cycle of cleaning and recirculating water, any waste material such as fish faeces or uneaten feed is removed and captured for recycling.Lead Engineer for Barcaldine RAS Hatchery, Ewen Leslie, explained: ldquoUsing technology by Norwegian engineering company Scanship AS, we first aerate the waste to prevent any unwanted bacteria from germinating, then we bind it together into larger particles via the addition of a cationic polymer.ldquoThat done, the waste is filtered to separate the solids from the water. These solids, which are now of a sludge-like consistency, are then collected in a storage tank.Ensuring the sludge is both safeand suitable for agricultural land is Invergordon-based waste management company Rock Highland, part of the Avanti Environmental Group.Scottish Sea Farmsrsquo Lead Engineer for its Barcaldine RAS Hatchery Ewen LeslieThey remove the stored sludge via arctic tanker barrel and take it to their holding tanks strategically located across the Highlands.Samples of the sludge are tested periodically at the UKAS-accredited Scottish Agricultural College, part of the SRUC, and an organic waste report is produced identying all the components present in the material. This includes Nitrogen, Potassium and Potash a combination of which gives the sludge its high nutritional value.Once the sludge has been certied as being safe for use on agricultural land, the nutrient-rich by-product is then uplted from the storage tank by tractor and barrel and spread onto the land to enrich the soil and aid crop development.Rock Highland Divisional Director Neil Barker said: ldquoWe first started out by working with one or two of Scotlandrsquos whisky distillers, helping recycle nutrient-bearing effluent originating from barley into fertiliser.ldquoOver  years later, wersquore now working with distilleries from the Orkney islands all the way down to the Central Belt, spreading around , tonnes of distillery effluent per annum back to the land via a network of registered land banks across the whole of Scotland.ldquoRecent years have seen us ersy and apply the same sustainable service to Scotlandrsquos salmon farmers.ldquoIn addition to Scottish Sea Farms, wersquore also working closely with MOWI Scotland and the Scottish Salmon Company, with our proven model now collecting sludge from most of the salmon hatcheries across the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.ldquoFor the countryrsquos farmers, this salmon hatchery byproduct offers a really high value, low cost alternative to synthetic fertilisers.

Today sees the first day of The Orcadian’s online livestock shows, with the cattle and sheep sections kicking off. Ready, Set, Show!On what should have been East Mainland Show day, it’s only right that we have a match-up between two County Show cattle champions from the East. Today sees the  inter-breed champion judged against the supreme cattle champ from the year before, with the former exhibited by Balfour Baillie and the latter exhibited by his father, James Baillie.The  County Show beef champion was a -month-old Limousin cross heer, shown by Balfour Baillie from Sebay View, Tankerness. The unnamed heer’s sire was Craigatoke Jamieson and she was out of a homebred British Blue cross Limousin cow. She went on to be shown and sold at the Thainstone spectacular, on August , following the show.This will be tough decision as both animals were held in high regard by the judges at the time of their show victories. The judge from last year’s show, Albert Taylor from Northmuir, Kirriemuir said of Balfour Baillie#s heer: “She had a great carcass and bags of style. She had a real femininity about her as well.”The  supreme cattle champion was a December -born Limousin cross stot calf, shown by J. S. Baillie  Co, of Sebay Farm, Tankerness. The homebred animal was from a Limousin cross cow, sired by Newhouse Colorado. The stot itself was sired itself by Craigatoke Jameson.The unnamed stot went on to be shown at the  Thainstone spectacular that year, held on August .John Wight, from Bigger, was the interbreed cattle judge at the  County Show, of his winner he said: “He’s the best calf I’ve seen for some time. He was extraordinary – how he stood, his back end, top line, a lovely head and excellent on his legs. He was an outright champion.”SHEEP Our match-up in the sheep is between two Texels – the  County Show overall sheep champion and the champion from five years before, in . The  winner was a Texel gimmer owned by Robbie Scott, from Dawn Cottage, Holm.The gimmer was an embryo transfer, whose dam Robbie bought at the Lanark Premier Sale after it placed as a reserve champion and whose sire was a tup called Tophill Wall Street. The interbreed sheep judge that year was Jim Kennedy, of Lyonston Farm, Mayboyle, who said Mr Scott’s gimmer showed “a bit of power and strength” which he looks for in any breed.The judge said: “She had a very good head on her and very good skin. She was a beast that would have stood in any company at any show.”The  sheep champion was a Texel ewe lamb shown by Ivan Scott,  Hill of Heddle, Finstown. Born in March, the ewe lamb was by Cairness United and out of a Knap ewe by Knock Papoose. It was a very successful show for Mr Scott who hadn’t shown anything for the  years previous to the  show.Mr Kenny Mair, from Kinnermit Farm, in Turrf judged the ewe. He said of the champion: “The Texel is a very bright and alert animal who stood well. She had a fair bit of character.”Check back at .pm to see what our judges went for.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code says dogs should not be taken into fields where there are lambs or other young farm animals.#Police Scotland will enforce the existing legislation robustly, ensuring all reported cases of sheep worrying are thoroughly investigated and offenders reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Farmers and those who use the countryside are urged to report all incidents of livestock worrying to police on  or  in an emergency.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to NHS Orkney#s interim chief executive, Michael Dickson, this is because the new positive test was conducted by an industrial lab which had not been validated by the NHS.The inidual, who is not currently in Orkney — but has been in the county during the past week — has been asked to self-isolated. This person will be immediately re-tested by the nearest NHS veried lab — the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow.  In the meantime, NHS Orkney will be tracing iniduals that the person in question has come into signicant contact with.It should be confirmed within the next three days whether this is indeed a new test-positive case — the tenth for Orkney,so.Mr Dickson said: #A number of industries use labs to undertake COVID swab tests and this labs are not validated by the NHS.#We can#t be confident that,the same test had been done in an NHS lab, it would have achieved the same result.#The interim chief executive, who is the permanent chief executive for NHS Shetland, explained that there had been a similar issue with a possible case within his home board. He added that, like in Shetland, he would be working to see whether some industries which have been testing their staff for the virus could do so through an NHS veried lab.#What we do is presume the person is positive,# Mr Dickson continued.#We kick in all the our well-rehearsed contact-tracing mechanisms and we instruct the person to self-isolate where they are.#When this happened in Shetland, the second test came back negative. It#s dficult, but we have to err by the side of caution.#Mr Dickson said that he understood that there would be an element of anxiety around this new possible case, and advised that all those who have come into signicant contact with the inidual in question will be contacted and asked to self-isolate for  days. If a contact is in a high risk category, a decision may be taken to immediately test them for coronavirus.#If you do not receive a call from our contact tracing team, then basically you#ve not been in signicant contact with this inidual,# the interim chief executive said.It is not knownthis case will be included in NHS Orkney’s positive COVID cases as the original lab is not an NHS facility.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

with schools the new frontline.Earlier this week Mr Weir said theof pupils for the new term is possible, even though it is only weeks away.He has been facing growing pressure to set out a comprehensive plan detailing how a safeto classrooms can be achieved.However, the department has admitted that issues have arisen over funding.A spokesperson said: The Department and the Education Authority have worked together to quanty the anticipated costs to facilitate the reopening of schools, which includes PPE.As there is insufficient funding within the education budget to address the quantum of pressures identied, additional funding would need to be agreed by the Executive.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEducation Minister Peter Weir FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappEducation Minister Peter WeirMr Weir plans to bring a paper to the Executive to get agreement on the issue soon, however, it is likely that other departments will be bidding for funding too.Mr McCamphill said that their members are very concerned by the lack of clarity on the situation as well as the lack of funding for schools.He said: They#re also very concerned that Peter Weir seems to be disregarding his own guidance that he published on June , which set out the plan for how schools should reopen in August and September.When that guidance was introduced in June, the incidence rate was fairly low, we had hoped that would continue to fall and maybewe were lucky it wouldn#t be needed.But that#s not the case, we have signicantly more cases now than we had in June, therefore the Minister shouldn#t be moving to substantially change the guidance that was drawn up.We clearly think the Minister of Education seems to operate under the illusion that schools are some sort of magical places where coronavirus can#t be transmitted and he needs to take this seriously and ensure that teachers, other workers and pupils are fully protected when schools reopen.The guidance says that schools must do this, must provide the sanitation etc, but without providing money they are leaving schools in a very dficult position and schools are being left to decide how much to have in relation to PPE and sanitising equipment.But our view is that schools need to be allocated funding and there is a model for doing this - in the Republic they have applied a formula based on the number of pupils in every school that schools will be provided extra funding so that they can then purchase hand sanitiser and protective equipment.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseChief Medical Officer Michael McBride FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappChief Medical Officer Michael McBrideStormont ministers are being advised by Chief Medical Officer Michael McBride and Chief Scientic Advisor Professor Ian Young, who both said this week that there would be some benefit to pupils wearing masks at school.Mr McCamphill added: I think it would be rather bizarreyoung people had to have masks in their pockets so that they could get on the school bus or go into a shop on the way home, but then wouldn#t be allowed to wear the same mask in school.Butwe want to educate the populace and young people to wear masks, education like with other le skills needs to be developed in school, so we need to model that practice of wearing masks in school.There is guidance but again, no money to back up that guidance, and that is what has got principals and teachers most frustrated, they#ve been told what to do but haven#t been given the money to do it.Time absolutely is of the essence.While there will be a phased ,we are to build up to a full ,that#s possible, we#re going to have to make sure that all the correct health and safety measures are taken, otherwise this will all blow up and everyone will be off again.It is the wider population we want to protect, many of those young people will be going home to parents and grandparents who are in the vulnerable categories.We are calling on the Minister to think again about bringing proposals to the Executive for full reopening.The Minister needs to continue to work with trade unions on implementing the guidance that was put in place in June and ensuring that schools receive adequate funding to ensure the measures can be put in place to protect pupils and staff as well as the wider community.

I#ve been a columnist for The Sun, columnist for the Daily Mirror.Previous register entries, dating back to , revealed Mr Paisley was paid between £ and £ for a number of articles he had written for The Sun.He added: I write articles from time to time. I think even the Belfasthave paid me for articles. The Catholic Herald is a newspaper, they pay a fee to anyone who contributes to it.In the Catholic Herald article, the North Antrim MP explained that his admiration of Catholics stems from the fact they are unashamed about the fact the Christian denomination promotes devotion and values family, children and le.He also admitted his comments may raise eyebrows coming from the son of the late Ian Paisley, one of the founders of the DUP.However, despite public perceptions of his father, Mr Paisley says that his upbringing as the son of a pastor meant that people of all backgrounds, all faiths and none were welcomed into the family home.Very often, it was a Roman Catholic visitor who wanted a prayer said for them and their situation, he continues.In the article, he also stresses that he shares identical beliefs to pro-le Catholics. What strikes me most is that they are unashamed and are never embarrassed about having a faith that promotes devotion and values family, children and le, he writes. These values are identical to my own beliefs. Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought. Even Christians can sometimes be too stf-upper-lipped to express emotion.He also described himself as a long-time campaigner for the protection of the rights of the unborn.Mr Paisley said it was without doubt the strongest support he has received - both publicly and privately - has been from his Catholic constituents.They are quite happy to tell me that they disagree with many aspects of my politics, he admits. But they say that#s easily put aside when they know I#m fighting faithfully on this matter. To hear them say this - either privately in whispers or more publicly - brings a wave of real encouragement and a sense that I am doing the right thing.He revealed that within his own constituency he had received support from Catholics for his stance on the abortion issue.Just in the last six months, I#ve received over  letters and emails from constituents who are Roman Catholic offering support on this one issue. That cannot be overvalued, he wrote.The MP added that he also has the support of anti-abortion campaigner Bernie Smyth, from Precious Le.He revealed that he was left moved when she signed his Westminster nomination papers on the basis of my pro-le credentials, adding the gesture was more meaningful as she was publicly happy to nail her colours to the mast.

To maintain an income to help feed the animals, farm director Chris Wilson started an online food shop selling fresh milk and other dairy products, and later expanded by selling fruit, veg, bakery and meat products from local suppliers.Although he enjoys the driving experience, Stephen is longing to get back in the air and has already applied for other pilots# jobs, hoping to be based at Belfast City airport once more.He recalled the moment he realised he was out of work.It was a real shock to us when the news of Flybe going bust came through, said Stephen. I was actually sitting in the plane at the gate in Edinburgh airport trying to refuel toto Belfast when I first realised.All we were told was that there was a problem and we would not be refuelled. It was only when I switched on the mobile phone that the real bad news came through.In the end I had to wait for another plane coming up from London that had enough fuel on board to take my passengers back to Belfast. We swapped aircraft and I was the third last Flybe flight to land in Belfast that night.Lockdown meant there was no chance of Stephen getting another job, so he ed to stay with his parents who were shielding.I actually just had sale agreed my first home in Holywood when the Flybe news hit so I had to pull out of it in the end, he explained. I stayed at home locked down with my parents for a few months when my friend Chris Wilson from Streamvale Farm asked me to run a few deliveries as the demand for his food rocketed.I started with Chris at the start of July and am now working four days per week delivering food to most areas of Northern Ireland.Although we have real early am starts, I am really fortunate to have found a job as many of my former Flybe crewmates are still unemployed. It says a lot when some of them who are pilots with  years# experience cannot even get a job stacking shelves in a supermarket.He added: As much as I enjoy it I need to get back in the air to follow my passion as a pilot. My starting salary at Flybe was £, per year so I still have a lot of that training fee to recoup. I have applied for a job at Stobart Air which would mean being based at the City airport again, so fingers crossed I get it.

The Ormeau Road is busy on a Saturday for a reason. We#ve built up a complementary retail offer that people want to travel to, he said.The new amendment put forward will also snarl up traffic and people won#t want to come here again.We feel there is a concerted political will to close arterial routes in and around Belfast to drive a potential green agenda and backNichola Mallon#s aspiration for people to cycle and walk more. That#s absolutely admirable, but that still needs a careful and considered approach where everyone has their say.SDLP councillor Gary McKeown welcomed the decision to hold a robust consultation that took all views into account ahead of any pilot scheme.In reality, we can only see how these things would work in practice by trying them out, and a pilot would provide a safe, managed space to do this, he said.He added that officials would work with volunteers to aid the design of the trial, allowing proper time and subject to council approval.In a joint statement, DUP South Belfast MLA Christopher Stalford and Botanic councillor Tracy Carrol said many were alarmed by issues like parking and the likely impact on businesses.Whilst we accept the people behind this idea may have had good intentions, we believe that it should not proceed as it will have a negative effect on the area, they said. We are pleased that the community is to be fully and properly consulted on this matter and believe that the more scrutiny this idea receives, the less viable it becomes.Belfast Most ReadIn photos: Football fansto stadium for Irish Cup final between Ballymena United and Glentoran in UK firstFee of £ to write an article praising pro-le Catholics is a standard payment: PaisleyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths but  new Covid- cases confirmedKilrea pays tribute to three family members killed in car accidentColeraine footballer Eoin Bradley facing six-game ban for urinating on Windsor pitch ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The industry reacted with disappointment to the UK government#s decision to impose a -day quarantine on tourists ing from Spain due to its growing level of coronavirus cases. The quarantine also covers Spain#s Canary and Balaeric Islands.TUI, the UK#s biggest tour operator, announced it is shutting around one third of its total of  stores.The decision was made following changes in customer behaviour, the firm said in a statement. Around  retail stores will remain following the closures. However, it would not comment on which Northern Ireland stores were at risk as a consultation is taking place.Tory MPs are putting pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce coronavirus testing at airports to cut the -day quarantine.And a group of  airlines, airports and tourism leaders - including Belfast International Airport chief executive Graham Keddie - have also called on the Prime Minister to introduce virus tests for those arriving in the UK. TUI said stores which are have reopened since the pandemic are not at risk of closure. But only one of its  Northern Ireland stores - a branch at Waterloo Place in Londonderry - have so far reopened. The shutters remain down at branches in Armagh, Coleraine, Lisburn, Newtownards, Ballymena, Craigavon, Omagh, Dungannon and Newry - as well as two branches in Belfast#s CastleCourt Shopping Centre and on Bloomfield Avenue.The chain has  stores in the Republic and is based in Germany.Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said: We want to be in the best position to provide excellent customer service, whether it#s in a high street store, over the telephone or online, and will continue to put the customer at the heart of what we do. It is therefore imperative that we make these dficult cost decisions, look after our colleagues during such unprecedented uncertainty and also offer a modern customer service.TUI is the latest high street chain after bakery chain Greggs and bookseller Eason to indicate that it won#t reopen at least some of its shops following lockdown.Greggs is closing three of its  stores - while Eason has shut all seven of its remaining Northern Ireland stores.Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, hoped TUI would provide clarication on which stores will be affected by the closure plans.It#s fair to say that this was a company which was facing a signicant challenge before Covid- due to the growth in online holiday bookings, he said.And in other businesses such as Eason which have also faced troubles before Covid, Covid- has now almost finished them off.There are not just the effects from the numbers of jobs lost in retailers, but closures like TUI and Eason also had a knock-on effect as footfall into the area is diminished.The pandemic and lockdown have had a catastrophic effect on demand for overseas holidays, with many bookings cancelled after quarantine was introduced. Yesterday easyJet cancelled a number of its flights.In a letter to Mr Johnson, the bosses of British Airways, easyJet and Jet demanded a more nuanced policy than the -day quarantine.They called for the introduction of regional travel corridors to replace the blanket requirement of -day quarantine for anyone ing from an at-risk country.Transport Secretary Grant Schapps cut his family holiday in Spain short as a result. As he ed to the UK, he defended the UK government#s decision.I very much understand, it obviously had an impact on me and my family, and I#m very, very sorry and upset for the thousands of Brits who are either away or perhaps even haven#t managed to go away this summer as well to Spain, he said.But it#s absolutely essential we acted when we did, it#s why all four nations of the UK acted together and the figures since have turned out to justy that action.We have to, I think, have a clear message and make sure we act by adding entire countries to that list for the time being.People who test positive for coronavirus or display symptoms must now self-isolate for  days as Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned of a second wave starting to roll across Europe.The UK#s chief medical officers said on Thursday that the period must increase from the current rule of seven days because of the risk iniduals may still be able to spread Covid-.In a joint statement, they said the change for those who experience the key symptoms of a new continuous cough, high temperature or loss of taste or smell is needed because of the low but real possibility of infectiousness up to  days.Their move came as official analysis said England had the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe across the first half of .Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumReliance on nursing temps could jeopardise patient safety in Northern Ireland: reportPatient safety could be compromised by a reliance on temporary staff to plug gaps in Northern Ireland#s nursing and midwery sector, a report has warned.Northern Ireland PremiumBelfast#s #Breastival# in plagiarism rowThe organisers of an annual Belfast festival celebrating all things breastfeeding have expressed anger after their name was used by a well-known baby brand to promote a similar event.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

It was a year to remember for the club who also cleaned up at underage and they have since added to their squad. Jack Bartons transfer saga from Moneymore saw him join Magherafelt. There was afor former players Ryan Ferris and Peter Quinn, who played for Thomas Davis in last years Dublin final. googletag.cmd.push They have a fourth addition in the form of Michael McEvoy, who missed last years winning run with injury. Selector Paul Quinn stated that it was dficult to get games and their meeting with Swatragh was their only outing. Surprising Paddy Power has the champions at a staggering   to retain their title and it is something Adrian Cush will certainly use to his advantage to fire up his side to again silence the doubters. Ballinderry have brothers Niall and James Conway as joint managers, with former goalkeeper Michael Conlan as team trainer. The Shamrocks pushed Kilcoo to the pin of their collar in the Ulster league final last season and picked up momentum going into the championship before Gareth McKinless injury ended their hopes of having a proper cut at Slaughtneil. googletag.cmd.push He is back fitter than ever, but his brother Daniel, who gave Karl McKaigue a testing time last season, hobbled off in a challenge game with Derrylaughan and Niall has ruled him out for the rest of the season. Ironically Conways nephew Sean Graham scored - in the game, but after being released from English soccer outfit Blackpool, he is going on trial with Crystal Palace and wont be available. It leaves Ballinderry, famed for their attacking prowess, reliant on Ryan Bell for scores up front against a Rossa team who mastered their counter-attacking game.

It was a year to remember for the club who also cleaned up at underage and they have since added to their squad. Jack Bartons transfer saga from Moneymore saw him join Magherafelt. There was afor former players Ryan Ferris and Peter Quinn, who played for Thomas Davis in last years Dublin final. googletag.cmd.push They have a fourth addition in the form of Michael McEvoy, who missed last years winning run with injury. Selector Paul Quinn stated that it was dficult to get games and their meeting with Swatragh was their only outing. Surprising Paddy Power has the champions at a staggering   to retain their title and it is something Adrian Cush will certainly use to his advantage to fire up his side to again silence the doubters. Ballinderry have brothers Niall and James Conway as joint managers, with former goalkeeper Michael Conlan as team trainer. The Shamrocks pushed Kilcoo to the pin of their collar in the Ulster league final last season and picked up momentum going into the championship before Gareth McKinless injury ended their hopes of having a proper cut at Slaughtneil. googletag.cmd.push He is back fitter than ever, but his brother Daniel, who gave Karl McKaigue a testing time last season, hobbled off in a challenge game with Derrylaughan and Niall has ruled him out for the rest of the season. Ironically Conways nephew Sean Graham scored - in the game, but after being released from English soccer outfit Blackpool, he is going on trial with Crystal Palace and wont be available. It leaves Ballinderry, famed for their attacking prowess, reliant on Ryan Bell for scores up front against a Rossa team who mastered their counter-attacking game.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster Christian Helpline is listed in the Councils directory as a prayer line and last month distributed literature in the Magherafelt area branding homosexuality detestable onto God. The leaflet also called on those who participate in such immorality to repent and turn from their evil ways and included contact details for people to get in touch. Independent councillors Dan Kerr and Barry Monteith have also written to council management to ask that the listing be removed because it may promote conversion therapy. googletag.cmd.push The incident is under investigation by the PSNI. A spokesperson for the council said the directory listings had been temporarily removed. The online directory offers local business and services a listing opportunity and any inclusion should not be considered as an endorsement by the Council for any goods or services provided by any organisation, they said. However, given the issue which has now arisen, the directory section where community and voluntary organisations have registered their details, has been temporarily removed to allow us to undertake a review of the provision of the service in line with our equality commitments, and to take advice as required. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last weekend, Devines  European Rally Championship campaign got off to a frustrating start with an early retirement from Rally di Roma Capitale. Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy had shown promise early on with eighth fastest time in Friday qualying as well as being the quickest Hyundai i R, outpacing works Hyundai driver Craig Breen and fellow Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Junior Driver Greacutegoire Munster. On Saturday morning, Devine was running on the fringes of the top  and despite not being fully committed to his pacenotes, was outpacing Hyundai Rally Team Italia driver, and former Italian Champion, Umberto Scandola. googletag.cmd.push “We were slightly disappointed with our start and knew we had much more in us”, said Callum after the event. “We were just starting to get into a flow on stage three and building up speed. To try and be on the pace on these events you have to cut where you can and carry as much speed as possible. There was a fast corner through a dip which we cut and there was a bang as we went over some stones. We didn’t think much of it as it’s not unusual to hear noises like that while cutting a corner. But slowly the engine began to lose oil and then the oil pressure light came on  metres from the finish of the stage, he added. googletag.cmd.push We stopped the engine and coasted over the finish but that was game over. It turned out that in the compression a stone punched through the sumpguard and holed the sump, causing the engine to lose all its oil. I could probably take that corner  times and it would never happen again, it was just a freak thing but when you’re trying that card is always in the deck I suppose. I’m really disappointed for the whole team after all the effort that went into the weekend, I know we would have been in contention for a decent result.” His next European Rally Championship event in Latvia in mid-August and Devine has another chance to show his speed on Italian tarmac this weekend at Rally di Alba, where he joins Kilreas Josh McErlean, the current Young Irish Driver of the Year. Rally di Alba will take place on Sunday, August  with the crews taking on three stages repeated three times with the total competitive mileage of the event coming in at just over km. Following the event Callum and Brian willhome to prepare for Rally Liepāja, the second round of the ERC. “Latvia is a loose surface event andthe year had gone to plan, I would have liked a little more loose surface experience in the Hyundai before this stage of the year but it is what it is”, added Devine. “After a non-score in Rome and the championship having less rounds this year, we’ll need to take points away from Latvia.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Oakleaf Lions will be only the second such club in Ulster, following the Titanic Tigers formation last year. “We are a group of Special Olympic volunteers and parents who are establishing a new Special Olympics club in the Oakleaf county delivering the Young Athlete programme,” read a statement on the clubs Facebook page. “It is all dependent on Covid-, but we are hoping to get a taster day between September and Christmas,” said Brian McGuigan, who has been working with Liam Oacuteg Hinphey on the venture. googletag.cmd.push “Then in the new year, we aim to have an hour session every week. At the minute, we are getting the word out there and are looking for athletes.” The programme is a play and sport activity for children from four to eight years of age with an intellectual disability. It introduces children to a wide iety of play activities in a familiar, supportive and fun environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. It provides a flexible framework and versatile programme which can be successfully offered in a iety of settings from inidual family home, to classrooms to community club settings - all designed as an introduction to fundamental movement skills. googletag.cmd.push The benefits of physical activity and play go beyond sports. The programme helps children interact with each other and develop communication, learning and self-help skills. It also introduces children to the Special Olympics programme and their family members to a network of support as well as preparing children for future membership into Special Olympics clubs. One of the long-term benefit of the programme is the opportunity to involve children with intellectual disabilities before they reach the age of eight. This will foster future involvement and hopefully participation in lelong sport and physical activity. If you are a parent with a child between four-eight with an intellectual disability or you want to give up some time to help out contact Brianor Maeve .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier.

He said the business has been in existence since , with the amount of birds at the site remaining the same.Mr Shields said the proposal is for a ldquomodern, environmentally friendly unit and explained that he finds himself in the ldquoridiculous situation where he is trying to reduce emissions from his site by  per cent.He said this is a figure which the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs agrees with, but planners are recommending that his proposal is refused, even though it is a government target to reduce emissions.ldquoWe are looking to create efficiencies on our farm so that we will be ableto market all our eggs locally, rather than rely on the wholesale market in England where the majority of our eggs are sent, he said in the letter to planners.ldquoThis new system would give signicant benefits locally in both environmental and economic terms. Ammonia levels would be reduced by up to  percent and we would be looking to employ extra people to help with the grading of eggs and deliver them locally.Mr Shields said that he can continue with the older system which will emit a lot more ammonia, which is something that the government is trying to reduce..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Shrigley children’s sports pitches due for repair scheme  ","story":"CHILDRENrsquoS sports pitches in Shrigley are to be upgraded.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to carry out the work has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.He has been lobbying for the upgrade in response to residentsrsquo concerns and is pleased that the football pitches used by young people who live in the village will be improved.Cllr Brown said that an existing boundary fence will be increased in height alongside the provision of additional netting to prevents stray footballs from ending up in neighbouring gardens.ldquoGoalposts will be painted and holes in the ground fixed as part of a general revamp to improve playing conditions, he said.ldquoFurthermore, no ball games will be allowed in the play park itself and new signage will be erected to reflect this.Cllr Brown said he was pleased that the local authority is open to improving the conditions of the pitch and also the additional measures to protect local houses.ldquoEspecially over summer, it is important for the younger members of our community to have adequate outdoor facilities where they can take part in sporting activities, he said.The Rowallane councillor added: ldquoI hope that the improved fence offers residents peace of mind as their properties and cars will no longer be subject to stray footballs.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information. It should also be publicised in the Outdoor Swimmer Magazine.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the council took a decision to close all seasonal facilities in Newcastle, including both outdoor pools, due to Covid-.She said the decision was considered in the councilrsquos emergency business plan tabled at the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee meeting on June  and ratied at the full council meeting last month.In relation to the reopening of the indoor swimming pool at the Down Leisure Centre, the spokeswoman said the local authority was currently considering recent announcements by the Northern Ireland Executive on the reopening of pools and health suites and in relation to spectators at outdoor facilities.She added: ldquoAt present, these facilities remain closed until further notice.ldquoThe council is taking a phased approach to the reopening of its leisure facilities to ensure the safety of both staff and customers.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11640786.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

At first, the most likely hypothesis was that this appeared to be gross inattention to detail of the sort not alien to Mrs Foster. This is the First Minister who did not read the RHI legislation she proposed, and who just six months ago claimed that a border poll could only be heldthe Secretary of State believed it could be won by nationalism – a claim not only factually wrong, but contrary to her own position in recent years. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...However, developments in recent days point to something more calculated,still partially inscrutable.Mrs Foster and Michelle O’Neill first discussed this bill publicly when they appeared before their department’s Assembly scrutiny committee on July . Two days later the draft bill was published.But it is now clear from ious sources that this was not the DUP simply accepting civil service advice without sufficient questioning – as former DUP spad Tim Cairns reasonably assumed had happened when questions were asked about the bill over the last three weeks.In fact, Mrs Foster’s key special adviser, Emma Little-Pengelly, had been working in detail on the bill for weeks, multiple sources have confirmed. More than that, the most controversial aspect of this bill – conferring greater power on ministers to take decisions without asking the Executive – does not appear to have emerged from Sinn Féin or the SDLP, parties for whom such a change would sit wholly in line with their longstanding policy.Nor is there evidence that it came from civil servants who were either ignorant of the fact that it was contrary to DUP policy or with their own agenda.Unfathomably, the DUP did not just acquiesce in a bill which undermines its historic policy, policy so important that it fought court cases to establish it in case law as well as statute it was driving the process.Two weeks ago, Justice Minister Naomi Long said on Twitter that “it was the DUP who argued against changes for planning being addressed in isolation”.A senior Executive source has confirmed what the Alliance leader had said is accurate and it was the DUP which argued for the legislation going far beyond planning and covering every minister.Indeed, Executive papers show that Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon first brought a paper to the Executive on May , making the case for getting the sole power to decide planning applications.For some reason, the DUP then intervened and rather than the legislation coming from the SDLP minister, it was decided that Stormont Castle would take charge of it.Over the month between late May and the end of June, a very dferent bill was put together – with Mrs Little-Pengelly taking a close interest as to how it was crafted.Given the seemingly inexplicable nature of the DUP’s actions – including Mrs Foster and other senior members defending the bill by deploying a claim about a ‘three-minister lock’ which was demonstrably wrong – inside and outside the DUP people have searched for some hidden meaning in what happened.Has Arlene Foster consciously changed DUP policy to get things done at the expense of republicans also getting things done Is the DUP using this to try to somehow try to undo the liberalisation of the abortion law Could the party be attempting to undermine or prevent aspects of the Brexit deal which it dislikes All of those questions presuppose that there is likely to be some coherent explanation behind a political leader acting in ways which are detrimental to their stated policies.However, none of those attempts to impose some hidden order on this seeming chaos stand up after even basic scrutiny. Anticlimactically, the evidence points to a more prosaic explanation involving incompetence, arrogance, and what many see as Mrs Foster’s central character flaw – a predisposition when she has erred to shun humility in favour of haughty insistence that she is right.A month ago Mrs Foster and Ms O’Neill appeared before a Stormont committee for  minutes of scrutiny of the bill. Their one argument for urgently ramming the bill through the Assembly under emergency provisions was that there was a backlog of big planning decisions which could not be taken in a legally safe way until the passage of the bill.But on Tuesday, just minutes before MLAs voted on the bill for the final time, junior minister Declan Kearney blew apart that justication. He said that eventhe bill was passed by MLAs, planning decisions could not be taken by Ms Mallon until the autumn or winter because there will also have to be a change to the ministerial code.Mr Kearney did not misspeak because when Ms Mallon’s department rejected his interpretation and insisted that it could take planning decisions immediately, Stormont Castle stood over what the junior minister had said.With its own sole justication for cutting scrutiny of the bill having disintegrated based on the evidence of Mrs Foster’s own department, she faced suspicion within the DUP as to the real reason that she had insisted on that course.But then on Thursday the First Minister spoke to the media for the first time .Planning was no longer even mentioned as a reason for speed. Instead, Mrs Foster set out an even more implausible explanation. She said the urgency was because “there had been a gap identied in relation to ‘signicantor controversial’ issues thatwe didn’t have a programme for government then those issues could be taken [sic] by ministers in their own department and there was no necessity to bring them to the Executive. And I was concerned about that, and this bill stops that from happening...[that] could have caused grave dficulties.”It was a breathtakingly nonsensical claim. Paragraph  of the Lord Chief Justice’s judgment in Buick – the case Mrs Foster cited for the bill – made clear that where there is no programme for government then signicant or controversial decisions must come to the Executive.On top of that, Mrs Foster and her junior minister Gordon Lyons had argued that the status quo made the bill necessary because almost any decision could be said to meet the separate ‘cross-cutting’ test and get called into the Executive.If it was so wide that almost any decision could be called in – so wide that Mrs Foster wanted it tightened – what possible decision could have resulted in a solo run the First Minister now retrospectively claims the bill was designed to stop The monumental errors she has made in explaining herself reveal Mrs Foster to have a profoundly deficient comprehension of this complex juncture of law and politics.But now the deed is done. Mrs Foster may or may not be present when the full implications of this hasty change are realised.The DUP was once known for its professionalism and hard-headed unsentimentality. But, having grown lazy due to the lack of challenge from the UUP, the party is now prepared to accept a leader whose arguments have become so intellectually incoherent and error-strewn that they don’t even convince many of her senior colleagues while others accept being whipped to vote against DUP policy.With Northern Ireland’s defining centenary year just five months away, the DUP has a decision to make about who will lead unionism.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Box Two is to recycle foil paper and boxes, food and drinks cans, aerosols and cartons such as milk containers and plastics also. Box Three is for cardboard, glass bottles and jars.Bryson Recycling saysadopted it could mean a jobs boost for the area as well as making recycling easier. The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland.
