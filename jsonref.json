The royal Christmas dinner traditions include young princes and princesses eating away from the adults and being cared for by nannies, a tradition which means Markle\u0027s newborn will be in a separate room from her next year.In an essay on her humanitarian work, Markle once wrote: \u0027My parents came from little so they made a choice to give a lot: buying turkeys for homeless shelters at Thanksgiving, delivering meals to people in hospices, giving spare change to those asking for it.\u0027It\u0027s what I grew up seeing, so it\u0027s what I grew up being: a young adult with a social consciousness to do what I could and speak up when I knew something was wrong.\u0027What a difference from the opulent surroundings of Sandringham House, in Norfolk, where the royals have been enjoying the Yuletide every year since 1988.When the Queen and her relatives open presents on Christmas Eve, Markle, 37, will be able to tell her new family the story behind one of her father\u0027s first gifts, which made her proud of growing up in a mixed race household - Thomas is white, Doria black.According to Andrew Morton\u0027s biography, Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, her father bought two sets of Heart dolls containing the traditional nuclear family unit of mother, father and two children. \u0027He bought one with black dolls, one with white, and mixed them together to represent Meghan\u0027s own family.

The key thing is to have someone at your side that understands you, has known you a long time, likes you and commands your respect - and you know I\u0027m vicious, tough and brilliant - as you yourself saidWhen you made me your first Celebrity Apprentice a decade ago, you told me in the live NBC finale: ‘Piers, you’re a vicious guy. I’ve seen it. You’re tough. You’re smart. You’re probably brilliant, I’m not sure. You’re certainly not diplomatic. But you did an amazing job and you beat the hell out of everybody - you’re my Celebrity Apprentice.’Let’s be honest, what more could you possibly want from your Chief of Staff? You could have been talking about yourself!Let’s also be honest about something else: nobody else is exactly storming the ramparts of the White House demanding you hire them for the toughest job in world politics.Yesterday, it was reported that your first choice, the vice president’s CoS Nick Ayers, turned down the job despite it being an obvious step up.  You need someone who will staff the Oval Office with loyal workers, not reptiles like Omarosa Manigault. And I get on with Ivanka and Jared, and would encourage you to listen to them as much as possible.  I see them as a great asset and two very smart young people5) You need a CoS who gets on with Ivanka and Jared, and encourages you to listen to them as much as possible. I do, because I see them as a great asset to you, not a hindrance. They’re two very smart young people with independent minds who you know you can trust and who aren’t afraid to give you their honest opinions even if they know you don’t want to hear them. These are the best kind of advisors.6) You need to stop your silly war with CNN. I know some of my former colleagues have become annoyingly (and in my view, unfairly) partisan against you, and that bashing them goes down well with your base. But it’s such a waste of time and energy, and constantly calling them ‘enemy of the people’ is downright dangerous. CNN has received bombs and death threats. This feud is not a joke now, it’s deadly serious. I know how the media works better than anyone you’ve had around you. Trust me when I tell you this is a war you no longer need to wage.7) As Obama’s former CoS, Rahm Emmanuel, said this week, you need a ‘true wartime consigliere’ like Robert Duvall’s character Tom Hagen in The Godfather. Things are about to get ferociously nasty as Robert Mueller prepares his report into all things Russia. You don’t want a CoS who’s not up for a scrap. As I think my Twitter feed suggests, I love a scrap.          Use Melania more. She’s become a very popular electoral asset, who has barely put a foot wrong since becoming First Lady - and I get along very well with her8) Use Melania more. She’s become a very popular electoral asset, who has barely put a foot wrong since becoming First Lady, despite all the awful lurid scandals and gossip she’s had to endure. As you know, I get on very well with Melania, and think she’s a tough, fearless, highly impressive lady. You need a CoS who knows this and persuades you to deploy her more. I’m that guy.9) You can actually save money for the country by hiring me. I don’t need the salary and in fact, I’d literally pay to work for you. What could be a better ride than being CoS at this perilous stage of the Trump presidency?10) You need someone whose reputation won’t be remotely tarnished by working with you and who won’t mind in the slightest if you suddenly fire him. I’ve been fired from big jobs before and always found it both character-building and financially lucrative. So don’t worry about finally doing what you never did in 2008 and telling me: ‘Piers, you’re fired.’ Been there, read the book, seen the play, survived and thrived.I’m available for interview with immediate effect.Kind regardsYours sincerely,Piers"},{"url":null,"title":"The lost years legendary Playboy Playmate Bettie Page revealed unseen photos letters","story":"    When Bettie Mae Page retired at the height of her fame in 1957, she went under the radar for decades and now those tumultuous times are being documented for all the world to see in a new book out by Page\u0027s social media manager, and her nephew.

For the most part, people either lusted after her or wanted to be her and she has been attributed with helping to usher in the sexual revolution of the 1960s.One of the first centerfolds for Playboy Magazine, Bettie appeared on its pages in January of 1955 wearing a Santa hat, and nothing else, which has largely been credited as her \u0027big break.\u0027 But with that fame also came criticism, like becoming the target of federal anti-pornography investigators following bondage shoots with brother-sister photographer duo Irving and Paula Klaw.

They looked alike, they were close in age, had pretty much the same interests and learned how to pose together. They both wanted to be models.\u0027Ron had talked about that there was a bit of a rivalry there in terms of modeling. He said Bettie would get a bit jealous when photographers would pay more attention to Goldie on shoots. And that Goldie was jealous of Bettie’s growing popularity in the modeling world. But overall, they were very supportive of each other.\u0027Ultimately, as Bettie\u0027s star status rose, Goldie hung up her tassels in favor of a calmer life as an art teacher and mom to Brem with the husband she found while performing a strip tease in 1956.Not long after and seemingly out of nowhere, Bettie fled the spotlight in favor of a life of isolation for the next three decades.

And so, you understand why someone would think, My God, if this is aging, to hell with it.\u0027          Bettie\u0027s first modeling composite from 1945 in San Francisco is pictured above          Sister Goldie is seen above in this 1951 snap. Goldie died at the age of 78 in 2004, she left behind many belongs for her son, Brem, to sort through, and when he finally did, secrets from the sisters\u0027 lives were revealedRodriguez continued: \u0027In her letters, she said things like, I’ve been so depressed I ate everything in sight, things like that. So she’s clearly stating that she was an emotional eater.\u0027At the time, Bettie\u0027s many fans wondered where she had gone, with Penthouse magazine going so far as to offer a $1,000 reward for anyone who could prove whether she was alive and provide information about her whereabouts in 1996, according to the Chicago Tribune.All the while, Bettie was fighting a battle with mental illness, set against the backdrop of a culture that wasn\u0027t very in tune with its prevalence. In the 1970s, Bettie\u0027s third and final husband Harry Lear alleged the retired performer had several violent outbursts. Lear accused Bettie of shouting about the \u0027retributions of God\u0027 while waving a .22-caliber pistol around a ministry retreat in Boca Raton, Florida in January of 1972, according to a Time Magazine article headlined as \u0027the felonious Bettie Page.\u0027Three months later in April, Lear accused Bettie of forcing him and his two children to pray before a portrait of Jesus while she held a knife.  Charged with breach of the peace, Bettie was confined in Jackson Memorial Hospital for four months.           Around 1957, Bettie fled the spotlight in favor of a life of isolation for the next three decades, which saw her battle mental illness and multiple run-ins with the law.

I just did that.\u0027 \u0027We provide search today for any time you type in a key word, we as Google, we have crawled and stored copies of billions of web pages in our index. We take the keyword and match it against web pages and rank them based on over 200 signals,\u0027 Pichai said at the start of a long, technical answer. \u0027So it\u0027s not some little man sitting behind the curtain figuring out what we\u0027re going to show the user,\u0027 Lofgren asked. \u0027We don\u0027t manually intervene in any particular search result,\u0027 Pichai said.

We have a robust framework,\u0027 Pichai said. \u0027I disagree. I think humans can manipulate the process. It is a human process at its base,\u0027 Smith said.And Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert used his five minutes of question time to lecture Pichai - never even asking a question.\u0027You\u0027re so surrounded by liberality, that hates conservatism, that hates our constitution,\u0027 he said. \u0027You don\u0027t even recognize it.\u0027\u0027You run off conservatives, you embrace liberals,\u0027 he added.Republican Rep. Steve King also joined the lecturing. He suggested Google look at employees\u0027 social media profiles to determine their political leanings. He also told Pichai that when his granddaughter was using an iPhone, she got a result on him that he wouldn\u0027t repeat in public.\u0027The iPhone is made by a different company,\u0027 Pichai responded. Apple makes the iPhone.King then said the phone could have been an Android too, which is a Google product.Pichai responded the incident could have been a notification from another app and reassured the congressman that his team would follow up. Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu also got into the bias debate. He entered his colleagues\u0027 names into Google\u0027s search engine during the hearing and noted King\u0027s top result was an article from ABC News.\u0027Let me just conclude here by stating the obvious,\u0027 Lieu said. \u0027If you want positive search results, do positive things. If you don\u0027t want negative search results, don\u0027t do negative things.\u0027He added: \u0027And to some of my colleagues across the aisle, if you\u0027re getting bad press articles and bad search results, don\u0027t blame Google or Facebook or Twitter, consider blaming yourself.\u0027 ELECTION INTERFERENCE The hearing was dominated by questions of data collection, privacy, and allegations of bias against the search giant. There was less talk about anti-trust issues and regulations with a few queries on Google\u0027s actions in the wake of the 2016 election after it was revealed Russian nationals used online platforms to influence the election. Pichai emphasized repeatedly that Google found \u0027limited activity\u0027 on behalf of Russians. He said there were only two advertising accounts the company found tied to Russian, which spent a total of $4,700.He told the lawmakers \u0027you have my promise\u0027 that the company is doing all it can to protect the integrity of U.S. elections. DATA COLLECTIONPRIVACYThe first questions put to Pichai were on Google\u0027s data collection and protection of users\u0027 privacy.Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the committee, asked the tech CEO whether the average user understands the volume of data Google collects on them. \u0027We go to great lengths\u0027 to protect users\u0027s data, Pichai reassured lawmakers.\u0027We remind users to do a privacy checkup. We make it very obvious,\u0027 he added. Republican Rep. Ted Poe held up his iPhone and asked Pichai if Google could track him if he moved across the hearing room to sit with the Democrats. \u0027Not by default but there may be a Google service you opted in to,\u0027 Pichai replied. He added he needed to know more info about the phone\u0027s settings: \u0027I genuinely don\u0027t know without looking.\u0027  SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPANYPichai was asked about sexual harassment allegations made against the company. Last month, more than 20,000 Google employees around the world walked out in protest of the company\u0027s handling of sexual harassment and discrimination claims.Earlier this year, Google ended its use of forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases. Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked if Pichai will commit to ending forced arbitration beyond sexual harassment. \u0027We are definitely reviewing what more we can do in this area,\u0027 he said. GOOGLE PLANS FOR CHINA The company\u0027s plans for China, where its search engine is currently banned, was another topic that came up repeatedly amid reports Google would launch a Chinese search engine that would comply with the country\u0027s strict censorship regulations.Critics are worried that the Google project, code-named Dragonfly, will enable the Chinese government to block its citizens from accessing information it doesn\u0027t like and surveil its political opponents. Pichai was asked if a prototype was built for a search engine in China but was vague in his response: \u0027We have explored what search could look like in a country like China.\u0027At one point \u0027we had over a hundred people working on it,\u0027 he said.Pichai revealed Google has no current plans to expand to China.\u0027Right now, we have no plans to launch in China. We don\u0027t have a search product there,\u0027 he said.But he did argue that access to information is a human right and pledged the company would be \u0027fully transparent\u0027 if they do proceed with plans to open a search engine there. He was vague when asked about future plans. Democratic Rep. David Cicilline asked him flat-out: \u0027Will you, Mr. Pichai, rule out launching a tool for surveillance and censorship in China while you are CEO of Google?\u0027\u0027I commit to engaging,\u0027 Pichia said. \u0027One of the things that\u0027s important to us as a company, we have a stated mission of providing users with information, and so we always think it\u0027s in our duty to explore possibilities to give users access to information. I have a commitment, but as I\u0027ve said earlier on this we\u0027ll be very thoughtful and we\u0027ll engage wide as we make progress.\u0027          Rep. Ted Poe held up his iphone and asked if Google could track him if moved across the roomLAWMAKERS GET PERSONAL Other lawmakers had more personal questions - and suggestions - for Pichai.Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen said he used Google\u0027s search engine often and asked Pichai if the company should have an \u0027online school people could go to, with a Google representative, and you can log in and ask questions, and not like Comcast where you get put on hold for 30 minutes.\u0027 He suggested the company have a representative for people to talk to \u0027say, how do I do this?\u0027He also revealed he googles himself and isn\u0027t happy with the search results. He appeared to be mocking conservative critics who claim bias in search results.Cohen complained he had the opposite problem. \u0027This weekend I was on MSNBC four times and the first thing that comes up is the Daily Caller,\u0027 he told Pichai, adding that Breitbart News also came up several times.\u0027It\u0027s hard for me to fathom being on 8 minutes ... and there\u0027s more content on Breitbart News,\u0027 he added.Pichai promised to follow up.  Tuesday\u0027s appearance was Pichai\u0027s first time testifying before Congress. He was sworn in - as all witnesses are - and was careful in his response. He made many promises to lawmakers to follow up, which is a way for a witness to give a more detailed, nuanced, carefully worded answer at a later time.           A protestor was removed from the hearing          Ian Madrigal, dressed as the \u0027Monopoly Man,\u0027 watches Google CEO Sundar Pichai testify           Pichai faced questions data collection, privacy and allegations of biasOPENING STATEMENTS Pichai sat quietly before the panel of lawmakers as members made their opening statements.His highly anticipated appearance is being closed watched by those in the tech industry and those who use the internet to push their platforms, including GOP operative Roger Stone and InfoWars founder Alex Jones - both of whom sat in the audience for Pichai\u0027s testimony.  \u0027Google is one of the most valuable companies in America because of what it does,\u0027 said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in his opening remarks, adding  that power \u0027comes with responsibility.\u0027McCarthy warned of a \u0027widening mistrust\u0027 between tech companies and American people. He said that could be alleviated by transparency and answers.He warned the panel wants to know that any political bias among Google employees does not show up in its products. McCarthy, who has been a fierce critic of the technology company, said a question before them was whether American technology companies are surveying as instruments of freedom or fo control.          Google CEO Sundar Pichai is greeted by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the hearing          Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who started at the company as an engineer, at times got technical in his answers\u0027A free world depends on a free internet,\u0027 he said, \u0027and we need to know Google is on the side of the free world.\u0027Democrat Rep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking member on the committee, warned against focusing on \u0027right wing conspiracy theories\u0027 during Monday\u0027s questioning.He said it was a \u0027fantasy\u0027 that there was political bias in its search results, a charge President Donald Trump has made against the internet giant.\u0027No credible evidence supports this right wing conspiracy theory,\u0027 Nadler said.He urged the committee to focus on whether outside activists were using Google to spread false information to undermine American democracy.Pichai, in his opening testimony, said the internet giant steers clear of \u0027political bias,\u0027 arguing that this is a core principle of its business to maintain trust of users.Pichai also said privacy and security are essential parts of Google\u0027s mission, and that the company is committed to working with the U.S. government \u0027to keep our country safe and secure.\u0027Pichai strongly denied claims made by by PresidentTrump and his backers earlier this year that Google operates with a political agenda that suppresses conservative voices.\u0027Users also look to us to provide accurate, trusted information,\u0027 he said. \u0027We work hard to ensure the integrity of our products, and we\u0027ve put a number of checks and balances in place to ensure they continue to live up to our standards.\u0027Pichai said Google strives to offer \u0027platforms for erse perspectives and opinions\u0027 without promoting its own agenda.\u0027I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests,\u0027 he said.Pichai said that Google - which on Monday speeded up the shutdown of its Google+ social network after a second data security bug was discovered - supports federal privacy legislation, without offering specifics.          Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified before Congress for the first time Tuesday          Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee promised tough questions at Tuesday\u0027s hearing,\u0027Protecting the privacy and security of our users has long been an essential part of our mission,\u0027 he said.The tech CEO also sought to allay concerns that Google was snubbing American values by its decision this year to drop out of the bidding for a major Pentagon cloud computing project.\u0027Even as we expand into new markets we never forget our American roots,\u0027 he said.\u0027It\u0027s no coincidence that a company dedicated to the free flow of information was founded right here in the US. As an American company, we cherish the values and freedoms that have allowed us to grow and serve so many users.\u0027The appearance  tested Pichai\u0027s ability to be the public face of the search engine giant.\u0027It remains to be seen whether he can step up and be the kind of diplomat and statesman Google requires him to be,\u0027 Arun Sundararajan, a business professor at New York University, told The Wall Street Journal.  \u0027He has, for most of his career, been a product guy.\u0027 But he has slowly made in-road into the political world. Pichai was the White House on Thursday for a meeting between White House officials and tech execs, including representatives from Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and Qualcomm.President Donald Trump stopped by but it was Ivanka Trump who took the lead. Firebrand Republican congressman says he DOES want to be...Fired FBI chief James Comey says Trump could be \u0027in serious...Trump defends hush money payments to alleged mistresses as...Share this articleThe use of artificial intelligence was the main item on the agenda. Pichai is dipping his toe in the political well in the wake of waves caused by his predecessor Eric Schmidt, who had powerful political allies in both parties and counted former President Barack Obama as a friend. Google had some of its political peaks in the Obama years when it beat an antitrust probe  and secured favorable policies on net neutrality, online liability and copyright issues. But the political winds have shifted since then for online companies.Lawmakers are examining the need for stronger federal protections governing the collection of online data and some Republicans complain there is a suppression of conservative speech. President Trump has tweeted his complaints about the company, charging Google\u0027s search results are rigged.             Pichai\u0027s predecessor Eric Schmidt was close with President Barack Obama          Lawmakers left an empty chair in September when Google skipped a Senate Intelligence Committee hearingPichai has kept a  low profile since becoming Google\u0027s chief in 2015. A native of Chennai, India, he worked his way up the ranks at the company, starting as an engineer. He has already made overtures to Washington after the company angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in September, when it failed to send top leaders to appear at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing along Facebook\u0027s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter\u0027s Jack Dorsey. Lawmakers left an empty chair at the witness table to symbolize Google\u0027s absence. Pichai flew to Washington D.C. later in September for inidual meetings with lawmakers - and agreed to Tuesday\u0027s committee hearing.Google CEO Faces Hot Seat in Washington - WSJGoogle\u0027s turn for the Facebook treatment - AxiosGoogle Hearing to Preview Democrats’ Strategy on Big Tech - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"The iPhone different company Google CEO chides Rep Steve King","story":"    Congressman Steve King  complained about a notification his grand daughter got on her iPhone          Google chief executive Sundar Pichai told him iPhone is made by another companyHe is one of several Republican lawmakers who have alleged Google is biased against conservatives in its search results.

There was less talk about anti-trust issues and regulations with a few queries on Google\u0027s actions in the wake of the 2016 election after it was revealed Russian nationals used online platforms to influence the election. Pichai defended his company\u0027s search practices multiple times on Tuesday in the face of questions from  lawmakers on allegations of bias against conservatives.The topic came up repeatedly in the three and half the tech executive sat before lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee.\u0027Our algorithms have no notion of political sentiment,\u0027 Pichai said in defense of Google\u0027s search engine, which is the most used in the world.\u0027We approach our work without any political bias,\u0027 he insisted. "},{"url":null,"title":"Comedian pulls university charity event asked sign behaviour contract","story":"    Comedian Konstantin Kisin has pulled out of a student charity event organised by Unicef On Campus society at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)Student leaders said the ban was necessary to preserve the event as a \u0027safe space\u0027 and a place for \u0027joy, love, and acceptance\u0027.But Mr Kisin, 35, who was born in the Soviet Union, said the demand amounted to a \u0027threat to freedom of speech\u0027 and pulled out.The fundraising event, scheduled for January 23, is organised by the Unicef On Campus society at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), part of the University of London. More than 100,000 university and college students demand...Student, 25, slams \u0027sexist\u0027 rental firm after it advertised...Share this articleMr Kisin was one of four comedians invited to perform unpaid, with proceeds going to the UN children\u0027s charity.Politics student Fisayo Eniolorunda, the society\u0027s event organiser, wrote in the invitation: \u0027Attached is a short behavioural agreement form that we will ask for you to sign on the day to avoid problems.\u0027          Mr Kisin was sent a \u0027behavioural agreement form\u0027 which stopped him telling jokes which were not \u0027respectful and kind\u0027After listing subjects covered by the no-tolerance policy, the form stated: \u0027It does not mean that these topics cannot be discussed.

Scott had begun a second Antarctic expedition in June 1910, starting for the South Pole in October 1911 and making it on 17 January 1912, only to find they had been beaten to their goal by the Norwegian Roald Amundsen, who arrived a month earlier.Running out of food and fuel on their return journey, which was plagued by terrible weather, Edgar Evans died on 17 February. A month later, Lawrence Oates, suffering from frostbite, left the tent with the immortal line: “I am just going outside and may be some time.” This left EA Wilson, HR Bowers and Scott, confined to their tent by a blizzard, 11 miles from their destination. Scott wrote his last diary entry on 29 March 1912: “We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far. It seems a pity, but I do not think I can write more.”“The frost had made the skin yellow \u0026amp transparent \u0026amp I’ve never seen anything worse in my life. The Owner seems to have struggled hard in the moment of death, while the two others seem to have gone off in a kind of sleep,” he recorded, adding that Scott had written in his diary: “There is no more hope and so God look after our people.”Sophie Hopkins, a specialist in manuscripts and archives at Christie’s, described the diary entry as “extraordinarily immediate and terribly moving”.“He’s describing one of the most famous scenes in British history, and it really does bring you there, right into the tent … Clearly it affected all of the men who found them very greatly,” she said.Gran won the Polar medal for his explorations in Antarctica, going on to become the first man to pilot a heavier-than-air plane across the North Sea in 1914. He’d later join the Royal Flying Corps under the assumed name Teddy Grant, disguised as a Canadian, in order to get around Norway’s neutrality and fight in the first world war. Gran died in 1980, aged 91.The journals were put up for sale by his son, Herman. Hopkins said: “His father was such an extraordinary man, who had achieved more before the age of 30 than most of us could hope for in a lifetime.”The two diaries – the first covers 7 November 1911 to 25 February 1912- contain material that has never been published. “Very often these are his more intimate personal thoughts, and the reason for keeping them unpublished seems a little sweet,” said Hopkins. “Often it’s when he’s worrying about the welfare of the ponies or is sad because they’ve had to kill two of the dogs. Very often we have the image of these polar explorers as grizzled, hardened men who felt no pain or emotions, but Tryggve Gran was only in his early 20s when he was chosen to be the ski expert on the Terra Nova expedition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c4175609defc5e9a905ffa71b2ad19a943eeb43/27_230_3451_2071/master/3451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0ee4894b97d43037cd0c1f541cfa019","title":"dixons carphone loses 440m in six months","story":"Electronics retailer plans cost-savings of £200m to claw back losses but rules out job cutsDixons Carphone slumped to a loss of £440m in the first half of its financial year, with the struggling electronics retailer announcing more than £200m of cost savings.The big loss came in part because the company, formed through the merger of Dixons with Carphone Warehouse in 2014, was forced to write down the value of the mobile retailing brand which is unprofitable, by £344m.The company said it had “firm plans” for £200m of cost savings, with IT, supply chain and central office spending targeted, but the chief executive, Alex Baldock, said they would not be achieved through job losses among its 30,000-plus staff.The group issued a profits warning in May, saying it would close about 100 stores this year. Some analysts had expected it to announce further cutbacks along with Wednesday’s results, but Baldock said there were no plans to close more shops. But he added: “Clearly we’ll keep that under review.”The firm also warned that other one-off costs, including pension regulatory issues and the bill for the major data breach it suffered earlier this year, when up to 10m customer records were potentially compromised, will reach £100m, up from earlier estimates of about £30m.The struggles of Carphone Warehouse come amid a broader malaise in the British retail industry, as consumers increasingly choose to shop online. In response, Dixons Carphone said it would increase investment in its online offerings, as well as expanding its offer of credit to consumers to buy more expensive items.Dixons Carphone said it had “substantial contingency plans” to cover a no-deal Brexit, but added that “all financial guidance is provided on the basis that there is no significant change in macroeconomic outlook”.The company also announced a share ownership scheme, with every permanent employee with 12 months’ service granted at least £1,000 of shares each over the next three years, at a cost to the company of £30m a year. The share scheme will come on top of existing benefits and bonuses, Baldock said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/697eaa0c0eee17d430de4516cefccd204f94dc08/0_119_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58502aed3c27a8516df2623b456316eb","title":"tuc calls for target of 1m manufacturing and hi tech jobs by 2030","story":"Report says government’s flagship industrial strategy is ‘vague’ and has made little progress one year onThe Trades Union Congress has called on the government to set a target to create 1m manufacturing and hi-tech jobs by 2030 to bolster its industrial strategy.In a report on the government’s flagship industrial policy, which launched a year ago, the unions’ umbrella group said too little progress had been made and greater checks on its progress were needed.It urged the government to set targets to ensure the policy achieves its aims of boosting jobs, investment and improving workers’ pay by helping make UK business more productive.Manufacturing groups have lamented the lack of meaningful progress made since the launch of the industrial strategy, while others have criticised the policy as vague and lacking in measurable outcomes.Although a council to check on its progress was promised at its launch, it took almost a year before it was established under Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England.Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said very little had been achieved: “Too many parts of Britain have been held back by a lack of decent jobs. They deserve better.“That means businesses, government and trade unions working together, locally and nationally, to bring hi-tech industries to more places across the UK.”Manufacturing has become a smaller part of the UK economy since the 1970s, shrinking from almost a third of economic output to around a 10th, while jobs have also been lost.However, the TUC said that sustainable industry and green tech could be one of the key planks in delivering future manufacturing jobs, while arguing that targets could help the policy meet its aims.The report said: “It could be argued that concrete commitments and accountability focus the minds of politicians in a way that arguing for manufacturing strength, in an abstract sense, does not.”Other recommendations by the TUC include a target for a third of the industrial strategy challenge fund to be directed toward investments known to be providers of quality employment, as well as a twice-yearly review into the number of roles it has helped to create.It also said local enterprise partnerships ought to work with unions to develop growth plans as part of the industrial strategy, while also demanding that unions are involved in talks to create sector deals – a key part of the industrial strategy giving government backing to particular industries.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We are getting on with delivering the modern industrial strategy with record levels of investment in R\u0026ampD, the fastest growth in infrastructure spending in the G7, the biggest shakeup to technical education in a generation and sector deals to put the UK at the forefront of the industries of the future.“The independent Industrial Strategy Council is holding the government to account by monitoring the success in delivering the industrial strategy and its impact on the economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f358afaa40d03ab187933c17b03f9f907c14ff2/0_146_7064_4239/master/7064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78014a00b63fa6cca612579c28ec5687","title":"markets rally china car tariffs pound brexit business live","story":"Investors welcome signs that tensions between Beijing and Washington are thawingProfessor Christopher Balding, a China expert, says it would be very significant if Beijing is indeed rethinking its economic plans (see last post).Others are sceptical, such as Scott Paul of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.......financial commentator Jim Cramer is also cautious.NEWSFLASH: Chinese officials are rewriting their economic plans in response to Donald Trump’s trade war threats, according to the Wall Street Journal.In what would be a major switch, Beijing is drafting a replacement for the “Made In China 2025” policy driven by president Xi.The new plan would give foreign companies greater access to China -- one of Trump’s key demands.China plans to replace an industrial policy savaged by the Trump administration as protectionist with a new program promising greater access for foreign companies, according to people briefed on the matter, in a move to resolve trade tensions with the U.S.Nothing official yet, of course.

They are starting, just starting now.”Wheat prices have also risen Reuters has the details: The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade gained 0.7 percent to $9.21-34 a bushel, after touching its highest since Dec. 3 at $9.23 a bushel.Wheat was up 0.8 percent at $5.25-14 a bushel, having closed down 0.8 percent on Tuesday, and corn added 0.4 percent at $3.86-14 a bushel, having gained 0.2 percent in the previous session.Here’s Richard Partington on the City’s reaction to tonight’s confidence vote: Stephen Martin, the director general of the Institute of Directors, also criticised MPs. Martin said: “The last thing businesses needed today was even more uncertainty – and yet politics has managed to deliver on that once again.“Many business leaders, along with the rest of the country, will be tearing their hair out at the state of Westminster politics at the moment. We are edging closer and closer to no deal as a result of constant can-kicking and internal domestic political strife.”Wall Street is expected to pick up the baton, and rally when trading begins in under three hours:Good news.

We’re considering it.”“With diesel buses I can remember standing at the bus stop and the heat, noise and emissions they generated made it unbearable in the summer,” says Ma. “The electric buses have made a tremendous difference.”China’s drive to reduce the choking smog that envelops many of its major cities has propelled a huge investment in electric transport. Although it remains expensive for cities to introduce electric buses – one bus costs around 1.8 million yuan (£208,000) – Shenzhen was able to go all-electric thanks to generous subsidies from both central and local government.To keep Shenzhen’s electric vehicle fleet running, the city has built around 40,000 charging piles. Shenzhen Bus Company has 180 depots with their own charging facilities installed. One of its major depots in Futian can accommodate around 20 buses at the same time. “Most of the buses we charge overnight for two hours and then they can run their entire service, as the range of the bus is 200km per charge,” says Ma.Availability of charging stations is a major factor in why it is it difficult for other cities around the world to switch to all-electric bus fleets, but Ma says China being a one-party state hasn’t necessarily made it any easier in Shenzhen. “We have some of our own depots, but we also have to rent some from the municipal government, as well as from the private sector,” he says. “Aside from the subsidies in terms of purchasing the buses, we are very much left to ourselves to how we look for resources for our charging infrastructure.”Getting the required charging infrastructure for taxis is proving more challenging. By the end of this month, all of Shenzhen’s 13,000 taxis are required to switch to electric. Shenzhen Bus Company has switched its entire fleet of 4,600 taxis to electric ahead of schedule.“For taxis it’s more about distribution than the number of charging pillars because taxis run all over the place and they have no fixed routes,” says Ma. “We are looking at all sorts of different solutions – from parking spaces in public areas like municipal parks and some of the major government venues, as well as temporary sites in local villages that might have communal land we can hire.”The lack of charging stations is causing friction between taxi drivers. “You always hear about fights between taxi drivers trying to get into the charging stations and things like that,” says Ma. “It’s difficult for the drivers because obviously they can’t go too far out of the way to charge the taxis.”His firm is developing an app to track where charging spaces are available and notify drivers in real time.But with central government planning to withdraw subsidies by 2020, introducing electric buses elsewhere could be too expensive.There is also geography to consider. Shenzhen is fairly flat, but the hills of nearby Hong Kong have proven too much in trials of electric buses. Other cities in northern China have struggled with battery power in the extreme cold of winter.Meanwhile, cities such as London and New York are accelerating their drive towards electric buses. London plans to make all single-decker buses emission-free by 2020, and all double-deckers hybrid by 2019. New York plans to make its bus fleet all-electric by 2040.Riding the 222 bus the length of Shenzhen’s CBD, you hear little sound other than a soft whine when the driver accelerates. The easy-to-clean hard plastic seats are not the most comfortable but most passengers opt to stand anyway – a choice made easier by the smoothness of the ride.Roll into our destination, the doors open with a beep, beep, beep – the loudest noise the bus has made the entire journey.“It’s quieter, smoother and I only pay the same fare as before,” says Lai, a regular passenger. “I would say most people here are happy with the switch.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6c54ef5e8a19b314b47c4658e4dea982c255f61/0_189_6248_3749/master/6248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99aa42f4270a49448e7c69c1f59b015c","title":"shopping habits amazon alexa","story":"Underneath my glee at the deals and the convenience, I know Amazon is not good. And so, I’m starting with Christmas.This holiday season, what I’d like is some self-discipline. Not towards cookies or festive cranberry-flavored cocktails – give all those to me – but towards the incredible ease and convenience of buying every last one of my gifts on Amazon.Last year I did not purchase a single major present that did not come from Amazon. Not one. And while I’ve been lured in by the reasonable prices and free (for a fee!) Prime shipping for years, it’s only in the last 12 months that I’ve finally realized: the reason Amazon keeps taking over the world, despite having terrible labor practices, is … me.It’s not faceless hordes that don’t shop locally. It’s not evil data scientists hell-bent on placing frightening mini robots that listen to conversations in every household. It’s me. And millions of people exactly like me.I’m sorry, little shops. Like everyone else, I honestly love you.That’s why I’m stopping this Amazon Christmas present habit.Alexa: this ends now.It was actual rabbits, in 2011, that led me down the Amazon Prime rabbit-hole in the first place. At the time, I was living in Chicago with my partner and our two pet rabbits. Now, a rabbit’s diet consists mostly of timothy hay – they go through huge amounts of the stuff, devouring strand after strand like miniature wood chippers. Pet stores sell timothy hay, but only in grudging bags that are so expensive they cause you to gasp involuntarily and stagger backwards in the “Small Pets” aisle, clutching your heart.One icy January night, I had gotten off work late. Remembering I was out of hay for my bunnies, I dashed off the train and managed to duck inside a pet store as it was closing. I bought the largest bag of hay they had, wrapped my arms around it, and set off for home.I slipped almost immediately. The hay bag flew into the night sky, and I landed butt-first in a slushy puddle. Still a solid 15-minute walk from my apartment, I waddled sadly and wetly home, where I re-enacted the hay fiasco with dramatic flair for my partner. She handed me a towel.“Maybe they sell hay on Amazon,” she said. She had just gotten a student Prime membership.We looked. Amazon sold timothy hay. It was cheap – much cheaper than the pet store – and you could get it in ten-pound bales. Ten pounds of hay for $19.99?!I never bought hay in a store again.It turned out a lot of things were available and cheaper on Amazon – more things than I’d realized. The face soap I use that’s hard to find was on there. The crunchy hippie lotion I like that absorbs immediately and smells like coconut milk and I’d only ever seen at random co-ops? Whoa. It was also on Amazon. The fancy disposable fountain pens I had to special-order from art stores were there, as were newly released books, magazine subscriptions, and shampoo. Socks! Makeup! Software! My use of Amazon just crept up. These were items I was going to buy anyway, and they came right to my door! The future was now, baby, and my god, my lazy ass loved living in it.And once it dawned on me that you could buy Christmas presents, and get them wrapped, and then shipped – for free – to someone’s house … well, I never really came back from that. Christmas presents were a matter of saving my money for months and then clicking. Done.But last year, after buying zero presents in a physical store, I didn’t feel pleased to have it all done. I felt like Christmas shopping had lost a bit (OK, all) of its magic. And I felt a little ashamed of myself.Because underneath my glee at the deals and the convenience, I know Amazon is not good. My soul knows it. I actually fear Amazon and how it’s taking over. I am afraid of Alexa and what she means, and I am creeped out by how easily, how casually, she was embraced by millions of households.I also know Amazon’s track record for labor practices is not good. I know the workers can’t form unions to protect themselves. I know the average worker makes $13.68 an hour and that Amazon is one of the top 20 employers of people dependent on food stamps in several US states. I know the workers are worked until they’re physically worn out they sometimes can’t even take bathroom breaks and still meet their productivity quotas. I know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos makes $3,182 every second (that’s $191,000 per minute) and that no one – no single person on this earth – should be allowed to be that rich. And what does he use it for? Humanitarian efforts? Eradicating childhood leukemia?“The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel,” Bezos has said.Amazon thrives and grows off the back of cheap, replaceable labor. And it continues to succeed, because oh my god, it’s Tuesday at 6pm and I am exhausted and hungry and the last thing I want to do after work is go to the mall to buy a generic-yet-just-nice-enough Christmas present for the office Secret Santa exchange.And I’m not alone. As a society, we’re all overwhelmed – pressed for time, all the time, and someone has got to do the shopping and wouldn’t it be great if we could press a little button and have the things we need and want just appear?I need to try and resist. Even just a little. Because I know what’s behind the blue half-smile of the Amazon Prime symbol. It’s a sea of human beings – vastly underpaid human beings who will walk up to 15 miles in a single shift to pick up the Charles Dickens biography I’m buying for my dad. They’ll pack it and ship it, and it’ll be here tomorrow, because that’s convenient for me.I’m very, very used to this. In fact, I’m coming to expect it.Habits – especially habits of convenience – are hard to break, but I’ve reached the point where I can’t keep pretending I don’t know what my little Amazon habit is funding.I could do with a little less convenience, actually.I’m starting with Christmas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af86a8034e04cda227499c67053b152fa9e0947f/0_42_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24ddddb3c24cc44b524eec398de6dbce","title":"welsh language party spotify culture","story":"When you’re a speaker of a minority language, you become fairly used to that language and culture being ignored by the rest of the world. If you move away from home, encountering another speaker of that language can feel strangely exciting: moving, even. As you chat, your corner of the planet suddenly feels less small and insignificant, and long buried personality traits start to shine out – every multilingual person I have met says their character differs depending on the language they are speaking. These traits can spend months in hibernation, and then a fellow speaker comes along who truly sees and understands you.Imagine my excitement, as a Welsh expat, when I read that two lads from down the road had produced the first Welsh song to hit 1m Spotify plays. The rock duo Alffa’s song Gwenwyn (meaning Poison) is being streamed as far away as Brazil, having been placed on influential rock playlists by the Welsh music distributor PYST.Growing up in rural Gwynedd, Welsh-language music was an everyday part of our lives. Every local gig you went to would have at least one Welsh-language band, with school friends often forming their own. But despite the success of bands such as Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci – and the support of John Peel, who always encouraged and supported Welsh bands – it still felt niche and community-based.There are upsides to this musical localism, of course. The UK live music scene is in trouble – in February, the first live music census found that a third of Britain’s small venues outside London are fighting to survive in the face of high business rates and noise restrictions. A group of 17-year-olds I spoke to recently, based in southern England, had never been to a gig, telling me that guitar-based music just isn’t on their radar. It couldn’t be a more different climate to when I was younger, where local guitar bands abounded. This live music circuit continues to exist around the pubs of Pen Llŷn and in other venues in Gwynedd, providing Welsh language musicians with a supportive environment in which to improve, experiment and develop. Except these days, the internet is there to provide these bands with a launching pad to the wider world.Alun Llwyd, the chief executive of PYST, told the  that Spotify’s inclusive cultural attitude contributed to Alffa’s success. “What’s beautiful is that Spotify judge the songs on music merit, not the language or the band,” he said. “Nobody knew Alffa outside a small part of Wales. This is testament to the strength of the song.” For music fans, the internet has widened our cultural spheres, providing access to more genres and traditions.Hence Wales’s other great success story, Gwenno, who sings in Welsh and Cornish. The fact that her latest Cornish album has been credited by the Cornish language board as sparking a rise in the number of people taking exams in the language shows what an impact musical success can have. The Welsh Assembly aims to get a million people speaking and using Welsh by 2050 – the spread of Welsh music can only contribute positively to this. Historically, Welsh people have faced oppression and prejudice, particularly from English people. It’s still not uncommon to hear anti-Welsh sentiments expressed even by people in the public eye, and reading English-language media can be an eyebrow-raising experience, with jokes about throat clearing and sneezing with regard to Welsh place names ridiculously common. Just the other day I came across a description in the Evening Standard of the comedian Elis James as “unapologetically Welsh”.Accusations of xenophobia are often countered by accusations that the Welsh-language community is insular and exclusive: but in recent years interest in a more civic form of Welsh nationalism has taken hold, which envisages an independent but inclusive Wales as part of a larger federal EU. Rather than taking place in the middle of a hard-to-reach field somewhere deeply rural, the national Eisteddfod this year took place in Cardiff Bay with free admission, opening it to a much wider audience and including the multi-ethnic population of Cardiff. Efforts like this, alongside the younger generation’s embrace of the language, means Welsh- language culture has ceased to be the preserve of an ageing, white middle-class elite.There are so many exciting things going on in Welsh culture at the moment. Musically, I would recommend Omaloma, NoGood Boyo, Ffracas, Gareth Bonello, Y Niwl, and Adwaith (you can check out the BBC HorizonsGorwelion site for more). In comedy, Elis James and Tudur Owen both do brilliant Welsh-language standup. The TV dramas Hidden and Hinterland have seen Welsh crime dramas dubbed “the new Scandi thrillers”.In writing, there’s the feminist anthology Codi Llais and the new magazine Codi Pais (not to be confused – the latter is a magazine for all by the women of Wales). In theatre Nyrsys, by Bethan Marlow, shines a light on the stories of nurses in a Welsh cancer ward. In poetry, more and more people are signing up to learn cynghanedd (a form of Welsh poetry in strict metres) – my father included – and I’m particularly excited about a new edition of the poems of Gwerful Mechain, who penned an ode to the vagina and an anti-domestic violence poem in the late middle ages.Of course, there’s much more out there than can be mentioned here, all of it, yes – unapologetically, defiantly Welsh. Thanks to technology, everyone’s invited."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749df71f2f36fa864ab8da4bb04bf46018e35920/0_300_6266_3760/master/6266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc6307e00703d14de7dc6b2b84f256f","title":"we could smell the boat approaching grim truth animal exports israel haifa","story":"Broken bones and other injuries are common for sheep and cattle held on ships for weeks in cramped pens. Photojournalist  Jo-Anne McArthur tracked the 22,000 arrivals on one boat in Israel’s Haifa portHundreds of thousands of live animals are transported each year on ships from Australia and Europe to the Middle East. The route from Australia to Israel is particularly long – the journey is three weeks at sea, where cattle and sheep are often kept in cramped pens for the duration.It’s estimated this year Israel will import 114,040 animals (cattle and sheep) from Australia, and 409,123 sheep and 169,991 cattle from Europe. Though these figures are lower than the previous year, in general live imports have been on the rise. Israel is expected to import 700,000 live animals this year – up from 200,000 in 2012.In July, I went to Israel to photograph the Australian ships coming into port in Haifa. One of the boats, the Bahijah, was carrying an estimated 22,000 animals.I spent a week monitoring the ships at port, waiting for news of one of the live imports. When we heard the Bahijah was coming in, we managed to rent a yacht that morning and meet the ship at sea. I was able to photograph the ship and the animals from a distance.The ship completely dwarfed us. I was struck by the smell. Even from further away we could smell the boat approaching. At almost every window you could see animals crowded together. The ones at the windows are lucky because they’re getting fresh air.The movement from the sea is really unsteady, and the animals are not used to that: in some cases they suffer injuries and broken bones. In April, a whistleblower employed on a live export ship worked with Animals Australia to reveal the situation on board a vessel. Footage from five shipments from Australia to the Middle East appeared to show sheep covered in faeces and severely decomposed bodies left in pens with living sheep. In one particular journey, more than 880 animals died during the course of the voyage.The story doesn’t end when the ships arrive at port.From here, the animals are unloaded on to trucks. This can take up to 12 and even 16 hours because there are thousands of animals on board.The cattle and sheep are then transported cross-country. I trailed trucks for hours to feedlots near Eilat, and to quarantine in a settlement in the West Bank. The feedlots were dusty and crowded. The animals in quarantine were lethargic.Dead farm animals are routinely washing up on Tel Avivian public beaches. Due to the distressing conditions animals are in, many don’t survive the journey at sea and it’s believed their corpses are just thrown overboard. The washed-up animals often have the ears or heads missing, so their ear tags can’t be traced to identify the ships.The dead and dying in feedlots are also often disposed in the desert. I witnessed football field-sized parcels of land with mounds of manure and decomposing animal bodies that must have been there for decades. The images can’t convey the stench, or the flies. The future of the controversial live imports trade is uncertain. A bill has been proposed in the Israeli Knesset to phase out live imports of animals from Australia and Europe for slaughter because of the suffering it causes the animals. The bill would reduce the transportation of live animals while increasing tax-free imports of fresh meat, and encourage local production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62459ee7891ced3ae93d67f5d2abfb8060981df8/0_82_2352_1411/master/2352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d33dbe5477bec7d0d2e2f01c6e5e4ab","title":"harry kane spurs barcelona champions league contenders","story":"•Spurs reaching last 16 is ‘massive achievement for the club’ •‘It’s important we go as far as we can in this competition’Harry Kane says that the manner of Tottenham’s performance in the 1-1 draw at Barcelona on Tuesday night was the latest evidence they can live with Europe’s best and should fire the belief that they can progress deep into the Champions League.Spurs advanced to the last 16 at Camp Nou as Internazionale could only draw 1-1 at home to PSV Eindhoven. Tottenham had needed to match Inter’s result to go through. “Thank us later Spurs,” PSV’s account tweeted, with a winking emoji.Tottenham trailed to Ousmane Dembélé’s seventh-minute goal but created a fistful of chances, most of which came in a dominant second-half performance and, when Kane teed up the substitute, Lucas Moura, for the equaliser on 85 minutes, it was no more than they deserved.Barcelona – already qualified as group winners – had rested a host of regulars, including Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Sergio Busquets.Spurs enjoyed similarly positive performances in their high-profile Champions League away ties last season, most notably in the 1-1 draw at Real Madrid and the 2-2 draw at Juventus. They had been widely written off after taking only one point from their opening three ties this season and Kane felt their response, starting with the Wembley wins over PSV and Inter and culminating at Camp Nou, showed their character.“It’s another step forward,” Kane said. “It’s a massive achievement for the club but it’s important we carry it on and go as far as we can in this competition. This will give us belief we can do that. The way that we played and the chances we created – it shows we can be as good as anyone on our day. Thankfully, the football gods were looking down because PSV got the result that helped us out.“There isn’t a bigger game than Barcelona away. We know if we get them again, maybe in the later stages– we played Juve and Real Madrid last year and did well – we know it’s in there. Who knows how far we can go? It’s about belief.“Not many people have been talking about Tottenham in the Premier League but we get on with our job, tick over until the new year and then give it a push. The Champions League is the same. A lot of people were writing us off after three games but we’ve showed the character we’ve got.”Tottenham will be disappointed if their new stadium is not ready for either the Newcastle home game on 2 February or Leicester on 9 February, which would mean it would host the Champions League last 16 tie. Spurs will be drawn at home in the first-leg and it will be played on either 12-13 February or 19-20 February.“It would be something special – Champions League games in the new stadium,” Kane said. “Everyone knows Anfield has been fantastic for Liverpool – they’ve pulled out some great comebacks and results there – and we’ve got to try and create that atmosphere.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07a13a9e23140711b825ccc03b3ea497c3b170c3/106_132_1970_1182/master/1970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=802f35019cfb1214045668e29e404126","title":"luton town aim high talented youngsters","story":"Nine years ago Luton Town were crowned European champions. They swatted aside Werder Bremen in the quarter-finals, edged past FC Zurich after extra-time in the semis and beat Bayern Munich in the final, clinching a 3-2 win with four seconds to play. It was at the Aarau Masters, a televised five-a-side tournament in Switzerland played in front of 3,000 spectators, where Luton’s under-11s triumphed, upstaging the cream of the crop from across the continent, including Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund.Among those celebrating that day was James Justin, now 20 and a core member of a free-scoring Luton team who are flying high in League One under Nathan Jones. Others from the class of 2009 have progressed nicely too, with Jamal Lewis excelling at Norwich, the brothers Jay and Cole Dasilva on the books of Chelsea and Brentford respectively, while Frankie Musonda remains at Luton.That year was largely a chastening experience, though, with the club relegated to the then Conference after being slapped with an irreparable and unprecedented 30-point deduction. “I wasn’t of age properly, but I knew what was going on with the minus points and administration struggles,” Justin says. “It’s crazy to see where the club is now compared to where it was at. It’s nice to have seen the club bounce back.”As Justin says, his age group was stacked with talent but failure to regain league status slowly took its toll on a thriving academy. “We played AFC Wimbledon at Manchester City’s stadium in the play-off final and we knew if we lost that game there would be turmoil because we knew all of our players were being monitored by the big clubs who felt they could come and sign our players without compensation,” says Gregg Broughton, Luton’s former academy manager, who now holds the same title at BodøGlimt after five years at Norwich. “Sure enough, we lost on penalties and within 48 hours the vultures started circling. Forty of our players had been approached, aged nine to 16, as our ability to retain player registrations expired.”Brentford tried to sign Lewis but, after Luton discovered a loophole, they won a case against the Football League at a Football Association tribunal to keep him. Lewis qualifies to play for Northern Ireland through his mother but competed for England at cross-country as a schoolboy and decided to focus on athletics before being lured back into the game by Norwich.The Dasilva brothers, as well as Cole’s twin, Rio, moved to Chelsea, but the cautionary tales are there for all to see. Michael Cain and Tarum Dawkins both left Luton aged 16, for Leicester and Arsenal respectively, while a 14‑year‑old Dave Moli joined Liverpool. All three have since fallen away from the professional game.Janoi Donacien signed for Ipswich last summer, eight years on from joining Aston Villa, while Cauley Woodrow, sold to Fulham at 16, is likely to line up for Barnsley at Kenilworth Road on New Year’s Day.It was Luton where Jack Wilshere began his career in earnest before joining Arsenal at the age of nine, while Kingsley Black, John Hartson and Curtis Davies were notable success stories for the academy in bygone eras. These days it is Justin, who joined the club aged seven and still lives with his parents, that the next generation aspire to emulate. When he made his full England Under-20 debut last year – aptly in Switzerland – Jay Dasilva was on the opposite flank.“I always describe James as the silver-medallist, because Jamal and Jay were the outstanding players at that age group, but James quietly got on with it, did everything properly and was great in training,” Broughton says. “When others have decided to walk away from Luton, he’s stuck at it. His dad is a big Luton man through and through, and it’s great to see James getting his rewards.“David Pleat built the culture in the 70s and 80s and the current ownership group, to whom David was operating as an adviser when they bought the club, had the academy as one of their cornerstones. It’s easy to have it as a cornerstone written down on a piece of paper or a slogan on a wall, but they’re very, very big on it. There are really good people at the club who believe in the youngsters. They have done brilliantly.”Max Aarons is another classy export. After trials at Tottenham and QPR, he arrived on the same basis at Norwich. The teenager impressed the then youth coaches with his aerobic ability, blowing away the rest of the field on the yo-yo test before earning a professional contract after shining on tour in Riga.Still only 18, the full-back has excelled for Daniel Farke’s table-topping team in the Championship this season, with him and Lewis marauding forward on opposite flanks. Another, Arthur Read, scored his first professional goal for Luton last week. Other graduates have moved on, with Tyreeq Bakinson and Freddie Hinds joining Bristol City last year, 12 months after Cameron McJannett signed for Stoke.Justin has seen the club – his club – go almost full circle, given Luton were promoted to the second tier under Mike Newell when he joined in 2005. His former agent was the late Cyrille Regis he regularly attended games and spoke with Justin on a weekly basis. “He gave me not just on-the-pitch advice but advice as a person, how to grow up as a good man and do well for my family,” Justin says. “He always used to say family comes before everything, and keep a good attitude. He was a top guy and I was sad to see him go.”This year marks the 10th anniversary since Luton Town 2020, a consortium of supporters, led the team out of administration, determined to consign those darker days to the past but also build a legacy. They expect to learn in the next couple of months whether a planning application for Power Court, a new 17,500-seat town-centre stadium and Newlands Park, a multi-use site off junction 10 of the M1, has been given the green light by the council. “Ever since we got promoted from the Conference the club has been going up and up and up,” Justin says. “We’ve managed to keep moving forward and we are looking to push on even further from here.”Luton became the first Football League club to pay staff the national living wage in 2014 and the chief executive, Gary Sweet, recently revealed the club has rejected in excess of £500,000 in sponsorship from gambling firms. “Both of those things will effectively cost us money but we believe we’re a better club for it,” Sweet says. “In our community, gambling is a problem and gambling companies want to be associated with us because it will bring them profit. We want to make things better, not worse. Generally, we don’t want to be associated with brands that make profit out of people’s vulnerabilities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace409197f0146a68d12a16650a2b9437fe180ff/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3d1c843b18c666eab133197df5161c0","title":"good sports 14 health sports and fitness christmas gifts","story":"Give good New Year intentions a sporting chance with top gifts for every kind of fitness fanatic – from cyclists, sprinters and skiers to climbers, yogis and football fansMeals on two wheelsFifty beautifully shot roadside recipes for “bikepackers” from Vélochef Henrik Ørre, plus top tips on adventure cycling.

From the coolest new clubs to harder-to-find watering holes, places to eat and green spaces, only a Londoner can show you the best of what the city has to offerThere are many Londons to explore. From the bustle of Soho’s labyrinthine streets to the vertigo-inducing skyscrapers of the City, the capital has almost as many unique enclaves as its 8 million residents. With so much choice, and so much ground to cover, deciding what to do in 24 hours can be a daunting task. Even for myself, a lifelong Londoner, there are always new places to find and old favourites to rediscover. With TripAdvisor at hand though, a healthy appetite for all things cultural, and a topped-up Oyster card, you’d be surprised just how much you can fit in and how quickly you’ll find yourself an honorary Londoner.One of London’s great virtues is its ersity walk through pretty much any part of town and you’ll see different communities living side-by-side and sharing the best of what their cultures have to offer. If you’re arriving by rail into Euston, you can do no wrong with a traditional fry-up breakfast from the quaint bistro Cappadocia. Sit on its garden furniture and stuff yourself with fried delicacies and all the trimmings. Just a short walk away, there’s Drummond Street – famed for its community of Indian restaurants. If a fry-up doesn’t tickle the tastebuds, then try a masala dosa, a traditional south Indian breakfast of thin rice pancakes stuffed with potato curry.You’ll no doubt need a walk after all of that, so hop on the tube for a few stops to the Barbican Centre, one of London’s most iconic brutalist buildings and cultural centres. Grab a coffee and take a seat in the courtyard by the fountains and then wander into the centre and explore the free art displays at the Curve gallery (recent displays have included the films of John Akomfrah and the startling photography of Richard Mosse). Or, check out the main gallery for larger exhibitions, including the stunning recent retrospective of painter Jean-Michel Basquiat.If you’re visiting with a family, on Sundays the Barbican conservatory is open – the second largest in London after Kew Gardens – and there you can take a stroll among more than 2,000 tropical plants and trees. Resident gardeners are on hand, holding bi-weekly tours to keep the kids entertained. The ground-level atrium also hosts regular free concerts and talks, encompassing everything from women in jazz to Indian percussion performances.If the tropical plants have fired the kids up for more exploration, it’s only a short walk from the Barbican to Postman’s Park – a hidden green gem. Throughout London you’ll find enclaves of natural space but none have quite the history or charm of Postman’s Park. Built in 1900 by the artist, philanthropist and radical socialist GF Watts, the secluded park is home to the Watts memorial, which was erected in honour of all of those among the Victorian working class who had given their lives in attempts to save others. Amid the hectic noise of the city, sit on the park’s benches and take in Watts’s plaques commemorating the acts of bravery that defined these heroic London lives.Ready for lunch yet? Jump on the bus, or take a walk through Farringdon to Exmouth Market where you can eat at food stalls serving everything from shawarma to risotto, pizza, and tapas. If you’re a sports fan, though, there’s no better place than the retro-themed Cafe Kick to grab a doorstop sandwich and then take on an unwitting opponent at a game of table football on the cafe’s French tables. Or if you’d rather something more sedate, down the road is Briki – home to deliciously strong Greek and third-wave coffee and a favourite of the local expat community.London has some of the best bookshops in the country, from the antiquarian booksellers in Mayfair, such as Sotheran’s – the oldest rare bookshop in the world – to the secondhand shops in Bloomsbury, such as the Dickens-named Jarndyce. But many of these titles will set you back hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds. Better for browsing is magCulture, a few minutes’ walk from Exmouth Market. Stocking thousands of coffee-table tomes and pocket-sized zines, covering everything from high fashion to slow journalism and interior design, there’s reading material for all tastes, and it definitely won’t break the bank.If you’ve nabbed yourself something you can’t wait to get stuck into, there’s no better setting than St Dunstan in the East for a spot of afternoon reading and relaxing. A few stops along on the Northern Line, St Dunstan is a 12th-century church near London Bridge which was largely destroyed in the second world war. Its remains now border a breathtaking public garden where you can sit among the medieval architecture and while away the hours.If it’s raining though (as London is wont to do), you could head into the Globe theatre on the South Bank instead. Here, Shakespeare’s theatre is recreated in all its rotund glory, and you can watch the Royal Shakespeare Company perform the Bard’s greats for only £5 if you stand in the pit, or go inside to the candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse for a more intimate experience. And if you’re with children, don’t worry, the Globe’s child-friendly workshops and family tours will keep the kids awake and entertained. From the South Bank outside the Globe, you can also take in London’s skyline as dusk approaches.Stroll farther west down the south side of the Thames and then back over the river (take your choice of bridge – either Waterloo or Golden Jubilee) and on to Soho, where you can saunter through some of the most well-stocked record shops in the country: Sounds of the Universe and Phonica, both of which regularly hold in-store performances from DJs.For dinner, the Tardis-like Brasserie Zedel is unbeatable if you want inexpensive French fare surrounded by marble fixtures and the buzz of punters’ conversations. Or, head to one of Soho’s many specialty eateries, such as Taiwanese burger joint Bao or Japanese ramen specialists Bone Daddies. You’ll have to queue but it’s definitely worth the wait.If the neon glare of Soho has enthused you, the evening might take a debauched turn. And if there’s one thing Soho has in abundance, it’s bars. For an upmarket choice, there’s the Hotel Cafe Royal bar on Air Street, as well as the Hawksmoor bar across the road, otherwise there’s the cavernous Brewdog for artisanal ales and Milk and Honey for low-lit, strong cocktails.If you’re in the mood to dance off the cocktails afterwards, London has a cornucopia of forward-thinking clubs. A short ride up the Victoria Line is Seven Sisters, a rapidly-gentrifying suburb home to Five Miles – one of the best small venues for electronic music, with an impressive selection of beers on tap, too. One stop further up the line is Tottenham Hale and the newly-opened club The Cause. Here’s one for fans of darkened rooms and rattling bass, where the DJs perform behind a cage until 5am. And, as the name suggests, the crowdfunded space operates for a good cause – to raise money for local mental health charities.If electronic music isn’t your thing, there’s the Jazz Cafe in Camden, which (ironically) hosts funk, soul and hip-hop nights on the weekends, or if you actually wanted jazz, there’s the intimate Vortex Jazz Club in Dalston.If music isn’t on the cards, there’s the option of a late-night screening at one of London’s independent cinemas. The Close-Up in Shoreditch has a large and eclectic film library for avant-garde film buffs, while the Prince Charles Cinema in Leicester Square hosts cheap, all-night marathons and movie-themed quizzes in its bar.You might want a final snack before you crawl into bed. Many people will talk about Duck and Waffle as the best 24-hour eatery in London, but queueing times can be absurd and I find the food overpriced and underwhelming. Instead, the area by Smithfields market is full of 24-hour pubs and restaurants, frequented by the market sellers themselves. La Forchetta is a highlight for enormous portions of homemade pasta – enough carbs to send anyone to sleep.After such a jam-packed tour, you’ll be ready to rest your weary limbs, so curl up on a London Northwestern Railway train and enjoy the free online entertainment as you float on home. With stops at major cities from London to Liverpool including Bedford, Milton Keynes, Rugby, Coventry, Wolverhampton and Crewe, you’ll find a route to suit you. And if after all of that you miss your train home, don’t worry, there’s always more to see ... and certainly more to eat.For the best value tickets, with no booking fee, visit londonnorthwesternrailway"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d021732447702505e5f7955424ed54ed054a7eed/58_0_1560_936/master/1560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4feda8759a3c96928906f1f9adbf2964","title":"pmqs jeremy corbyn demands immediate vote theresa may brexit deal","story":"Ignoring issue of confidence vote, Labour leader decries ‘unacceptable’ vote delayJeremy Corbyn has demanded that Theresa May immediately put her Brexit deal to a vote of parliament, using prime minister’s questions to lambast the government for treating the Commons in a “totally and utterly unacceptable” way.Almost entirely ignoring the issue of the no-confidence vote from her own MPs that May faces later on Wednesday, the Labour leader turned his attention to the prime minister’s decision to delay the vote on the deal that had been due to take place on Tuesday.May called it off amid a near-universal assumption she would lose heavily, before embarking on a round of EU diplomacy to try to secure some concessions on the Northern Irish backstop plan.Corbyn said he was “delighted to see the prime minister back in place after her little journeys”. He added: “Having told the media this morning that she’s made progress, can she now update the house on what changes she has secured to her deal?”May responded by saying she had been heard on the backstop: “No one that I met yesterday is in any doubt about the strength of concern in this house on this issue of the duration of the backstop.”Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the\u0026nbsp1922 Committee\u0026nbspof backbench Tories, has confirmed the vote will take place on Wednesday evening between 6pm and 8pm in a House of Commons committee room. A result is expected shortly afterwards.A simple majority is required – the figure is 158 MPs. However, it is widely believed that May would be under intense pressure to resign if the were a significant number of no-confidence votes, even if she wins.The exact number is anybody’s guess but over 100 votes against the prime minister would be undeniably a bad result given that ministers will be expected to vote for her. Should May defeat her critics, they would not be permitted to challenge her for another year.She will have to tender her resignation as leader of the Conservative party, and ultimately as prime minister.\u0026nbspAn open contest for the\u0026nbspConservative leadership\u0026nbspwould then follow, although May cannot take part. Tory MPs then whittle down the number of candidates over a matter of days to two – who face the party’s estimated 120,000 membership in a vote. After a three week ballot a new prime minister would be expected to take over in January.A change of Conservative leader and prime minister would not automatically lead to a general election, although the Labour party could respond through a vote of no confidence.In increasingly noisy exchanges, Corbyn demanded the government reinstate the rest of the debate on her deal, and the vote.“Since the prime minister has not achieved any changes either to the withdrawal agreement or the future partnership, can she now confirm that we will have the concluding days of debate and votes within the next seven days, before the house rises for the Christmas recess?” he asked.May, watched throughout from the public gallery by her husband, Philip, said the date of a new vote would be “announced in the normal way”, and that the really meaningful vote, the 2016 referendum, had already taken place.This prompted a furious response from Corbyn, who said May was treating parliament with contempt.“It is totally and utterly unacceptable to this house, in any way,” he said. “This house agreed a programme motion, this house agreed the five days of debate. This house agreed when the vote was going to take place. The government tried to unilaterally pull that and deny this house the chance of a vote on this crucial matter.“The prime minister and her government have already been found to be in contempt of parliament. Her behaviour today is just contemptuous of this parliament. The prime minister’s appalling behaviour needs to be held to account by this house.”In further exchanges, Corbyn condemned what he said was the “ongoing chaos at the centre of this government”, while an increasingly combative May won cheers from her largely subdued MPs by accusing Labour of wanting to frustrate Brexit, saying its approach was: “No plan, no clue, no Brexit.”May declined to rule out the idea of a no-deal departure, saying: “The way to ensure there is no no deal is to agree a deal.” This prompted Corbyn to say: “Can I tell the prime minister this sorry saga is frustrating for businesses, for workers, and actually for many behind her as well?”He closed by saying: “The time for dithering and delay is over. The prime minister has negotiated her deal, she’s told us it’s the best and only deal available. There can be no more excuses, no more running away. Put it before parliament and let’s have the vote.”In his one reference to the leadership challenge, Corbyn said it was “utterly irrelevant to the lives of people across our country”, adding: “It does nothing to solve the government’s inability to get a deal that works for the whole country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1e39a51a434e55373cdabc10ccc3016f792f53/0_170_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db17956b8c56af6ae73a6fe375726fa8","title":"the race to replace theresa may the likely candidates","story":"Seven Conservatives are in the frame should the prime minister lose a no-confidence voteIf a vote of no confidence topples the prime minister, there is no shortage of candidates who may be quietly organising their bids to be her replacement:The former Brexit secretary has pole-vaulted over his rivals to become the first choice of many Eurosceptics. Raab’s credibility is perhaps higher than his predecessor David Davis because he had a more active relationship with Brussels, battled through to the end stage and resigned when he thought he had been overruled.He has not endorsed any leadership challenge to May and, like many of his rivals, almost certainly believes there is no personal advantage in doing so. He has the credentials as a Brexit “true believer” but is also seen as being from new generation of Tory MPs who have less baggage than some cabinet veterans.His name is never far from the lips of people talking about May’s successor but, apart from his instant condemnation of the deal on the day it was published, Johnson has kept his head down as the momentum moved towards plotting against May.Officially his allies stick to the line that it is the policy and not the prime minister that needs to be changed. However, he is certain to stand if there is a contest and he has a dedicated following. However, should he be successful, it could cause a schism in the party, a handful of pro-European MPs have suggested they would find that so distasteful that they would quit the party if he won.Gove has a dedicated follower base among MPs which straddles the ide including remainers such as Nicky Morgan and Brexiter converts such as Nick Boles. His decision to remain in the cabinet is a calculation that is likely to be informed by his betrayal of Johnson in the last leadership contest, for which his reputation has suffered.Many allies and aides are said to have advised him to resign from the cabinet but he has decided to stay within the tent and lobby for change from inside. His chances very much depend on whether he is punished for remaining loyal or rewarded by middle-ground Tories who recognise he has tried to make the deal work.Freshly back from a remarkably short time in the wilderness after her disastrous response to the Windrush scandal, Rudd is the firm favourite of remainers and soft Brexiter Tories on the party’s centre-right wing.She is the most likely to be the “stop Boris” candidate and that could work very well in her favour. However, she has several thing going against her, as an easy target for Labour attacks over her time at the Home Office and the very small matter of her Hastings constituency where her majority is very small.Hunt is clearly ambitious for the role and could end up being a safe choice for Tory MPs as an experienced cabinet minister. He backed remain but has become an outspoken Brexiter who makes multiple tough interventions in cabinet – which are then widely briefed.Hunt has had a remarkable ability to survive damaging scandals, including during his time as health secretary where he withstood multiple NHS winter crises and the junior doctors strikes. He may be able to walk the tightrope between leavers and remainers to win a contest, but he is unlikely to fire up many followers.Javid is another ambitious cabinet minister who has been keen to convey his conversion to Brexit from remain. A protege of George Osborne, he is said to have been instinctively Eurosceptic but only decided to back remain in the first place in order to please the then-chancellor.However, Javid and Hunt are not members of Andrea Leadsom’s “breakfast club” of five Brexiter cabinet ministers who have formed a band to try to persuade the prime minister to change course on the withdrawal agreement – suggesting they are not trusted as true believers yet.The international development secretary is probably the cabinet minister who has come closest to quitting but has taken a small shuffle back from the brink. She is an ambitious Brexiter whose name was mentioned by Jacob Rees-Mogg as one of his favoured candidates.One of her tactics has been an attempt to persuade May to allow Tory MPs a free vote on the final deal, a proposal that has baffled No 10, but one that Mordaunt may hope endears her to backbench Tories to show she is fighting their corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab7697e4d48e397abc0fcef30b1c8c5ef22e048e/0_322_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d18b6eb3f026ad9a68fcefab46c27d10","title":"cheltenham festival reduce field sizes increase pre race vet checks to improve safety horse racing","story":"• Changes proposed for meeting after seven deaths this year• Pre-race veterinary checks to be increased at the fixtureThe British Horseracing Authority published a series of recommendations on Wednesday designed to improve the safety and welfare of horses and riders in National Hunt racing as a whole and at the Cheltenham Festival in March in particular. The proposals are the result of a review of the Festival which was launched after seven horses died as a result of injuries sustained at this year’s meeting, including three in the final race, the two-mile Grand Annual Chase.In all, the review makes 17 recommendations, which include increased pre-race veterinary checks on runners, a reduction in the safety limit for two-mile chases from 24 to 20 and detailed analysis of faller rates for both trainers and jockeys both at Cheltenham and in all jump racing. Trainers and jockeys with faller rates “higher than the historical average” will be required to “engage constructively” with the BHA to find ways in which their number of fallers can be reduced.The review also calls for the launch of “a major research project” to develop “a predictive model for identifying risk factors” for all National Hunt racing, and emphasises that the rules relating to “pulling up fatigued runners must be appropriately scrutinised and enforced, to encourage positive and responsible behaviour”.The conditions of the Martin Pipe Handicap Hurdle for conditional riders, which was identified as having a higher faller rate than similar races at the Festival, will also be changed to prevent riders claiming their normal allowance. The hope is that this will encourage trainers to use the jockeys with the most experience, rather than those with the biggest claim.Launching the review on Wednesday, Nick Rust, the BHA’s chief executive, said that the number of fatal injuries at this year’s Festival was “unacceptable” and that while the overall rate of fatal injuries has declined significantly in recent years, racing still needs to do more if it is to “retain its social licence” from the British public.“British racing has consistently and continuously improved its record on welfare outcomes over the last decade,” Rust said. “However, Parliament has recently sent a clear message to our sport that we must raise our ambitions for welfare further. At the BHA, we share this view, and I am today calling on everyone in the sport to help us achieve even higher goals for welfare.”Brant Dunshea, the BHA’s chief regulatory officer, said that the review had found that “non-track factors are likely to be contributing to risk at Cheltenham, and the same may be true across all of jump racing. For this reason, this project has become a springboard for wider research to better identify risk factors in jump racing, above and beyond the continuous programme of innovation and improvement which has made the sport significantly safer in the last 20 years.”However, the review found no evidence to support claims that the position of the two-mile Grand Annual as the final race of the meeting had contributed to the high fatality rate in this year’s event.While there is no plan to publish the statistics as yet, as happens with data on non-runners, Rust told a press conference to launch the review that the intention is to publish the figures when there is sufficient data to consider it useful.Responding to the publication of the review, Rupert Arnold, the chief executive of the National Trainers Federation, said that the body “welcomes the analysis and insights into the safety of the sport’s participants at Cheltenham.” Arnold added: “Along with our members, we look forward to meeting the BHA and other stakeholders to discuss the recommendations in detail and agree an appropriate basis for their implementation.”The extension of pre-race veterinary checks to all runners at the Festival also has the potential to cause controversy, as events at this year’s Breeders’ Cup meeting in the United States showed. Track vets at Churchill Downs ordered that Polydream, the favourite, should be scratched from the Mile as they were unhappy with her movement while trotting, but Freddy Head, her trainer, insisted that the decision was “a disgrace” and that the filly simply “trots in an awkward way because of offset knees”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81021ae9c88652f509b2da8b1afb89d0601655cf/0_36_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3c2260fe3528a66159d530939ddfe91","title":"luka doncic rookie of year nba dallas mavericks","story":"The 2018 draft-class may well end up being one of the greatest in history. But they risk being eclipsed by the Slovenian teenagerPoor Marvin Bagley. The bouncy one-and-done Duke big man went second overall in the 2018 NBA draft and so far he is having what is, by any reasonable standard, an excellent rookie season, even though he plays for the Sacramento Kings, which is hardly his fault. Bagley is not an excellent NBA player right now in fact, by most metrics, he’s kind of a bad NBA player. But most rookies, even the really good ones, are bad players. And just 20 games into his career, Bagley is pouring in points and grabbing rebounds at the same ferocious clip he did at Duke – 12.9 and 6.2 in just under 24 minutes per game – and he’s doing it despite taking several thousand fewer shots than Trae Young.In almost any other season, Bagley’s nifty stats plus his arrival coinciding with the Kings’ revival would be enough to anoint him an early rookie of the year candidate. If he’d come out of college two years ago, when Malcolm Brogdon won the award because Ben Simmons was injured and the rest of the 2016 draft class was trash, it would be Bagley’s name on that trophy and not Brogdon’s.This year, though, Bagley has no chance. In fact, there’s a very good chance he will not sniff the top five. His only mistake was being born into a draft class so good he doesn’t stand out. It is too early to declare the 2018 draft class the best ever, or one of the best ever, but it’s time to start the conversation because, hot damn, what a group.By this point last year, at least five top-picks – Markelle Fultz, Josh Jackson, Jonathan Isaac, Malik Monk and Luke Kennard – were already looking like wobbly selections, especially considering that the Utah Jazz took Donovan Mitchell after all of them. Drafts like that aren’t unusual. Every year, a handful of guys bust fast. Even the legendary 2003 class – featuring LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade in the top five – had Darko Milicic jammed in there like a splinter. This year, though, all of the top 12 picks – all of them – look like legit NBA players, and several have star potential. Not one of them is anywhere close to a bust. That’s never happened before. From top to bottom, it’s the most flawless lottery class in NBA history.That’s been great for NBA fans, but it’s bad news for a guy like Bagley. Here he is having a perfectly successful rookie season, but because he went second overall in this draft, because so many other guys picked after him are playing so well, and most especially because one of them is Luka Doncic, the 19-year-old Slovenian wunderkind and mortal lock for rookie of the year, Bagley almost seems like a letdown. He is not. And yet, because of Doncic, he was definitely a mistake.Everything about Doncic is singular, from his 6ft 7in point forward skills to his EuroLeague dominance as a teenager to his goofy electric-blue YMCA thigh-to-ankle knee sleeves to the fact that he is, despite playing elite-level basketball every day for months on end, still kind of fat.Bagley isn’t the only one getting hosed this year, he’s just the only one whose reputation is taking a hit because of it. DeAndre Ayton, who is averaging a double-double, has been way too good to nitpick Phoenix’s decision to select him No1 overall. Unlike Bagley, none of the shine is off of him, and in the same way that the Houston Rockets did not regret taking Hakeem Olajuwon over Michael Jordan, the Suns seem unlikely to regret taking Ayton (even though they should). But the confluence of Doncic’s genius, the glut of rookies putting up near double-doubles, and the dwindling value of traditional big men has conspired to turn Ayton’s impressive start into a big so what.In terms of actual NBA wins and losses, and the near-future destiny of his franchise, Memphis’s Jaren Jackson Jr may be the most important rookie of this draft class, even if he’s not its best player. He’s an instant starter on a very good Memphis team, and a high-IQ player alongside a superstar (Marc Gasol) who does not suffer fools – but he’s also much more than that: he’s the glue holding this aging team together. If the Grizzlies had missed on Jackson, this roster very likely would’ve been blown up at the trade deadline, or this coming summer. Now, because Jackson seems like a stud, they’re all in.Where the draft really gets deep and special is at the tail end of the lottery and beyond, thanks to picks like octopus-armed Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, whose name is mellifluous and really fun to say out loud, and who has already knocked Patrick Beverley out of the Clippers’ starting lineup Villanova’s national title game hero Donte DiVincenzo, who is already a rotation player for a very good, very deep Milwaukee Bucks team and the Sixers’ Landry Shamet, the 26th pick out of Wichita State, who has emerged as the shooter Philadelphia desperately need now that they’ve either traded or emotionally devastated the only ones they had besides JJ Redick.In a decade or two, we’ll have a much clearer sense of where this draft class ranks on the list of history’s best, whether it can match the 2003 crop. And by then maybe a guy like Bagley will be a big part of the case for 2018. Right now, though, he’s just another rookie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/945bf2c880e20bb59f13bc1e82d182e70c458df9/80_289_3304_1982/master/3304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e7e074aa1d7d6f0b46cd12f606bb250","title":"team sky legacy titles ambition allegations coldness cycling","story":"Every now and then, a new force enters a sport with an impact so crushing that it reshapes and even deforms the whole competition. So it was with the state-sponsored German grand prix teams in the 1930s, with East African distance runners over the past two decades, and with football clubs benefitting today from the sovereign wealth of Arab states. Team Sky’s recent dominance of cycling’s major events can be measured on that scale.Many will mourn the passing of a name that helped bring British riders to the forefront of the sport: first Bradley Wiggins, then Chris Froome, and most recently Geraint Thomas. When Wiggins won the Tour de France in 2012, it was the fulfilment of what had long appeared an impossible dream. By the time of Thomas’s recent Tour victory – a sixth for Sky in seven years – it seemed almost commonplace. Froome’s victories in the Vuelta a España in 2017 and this year’s Giro d’Italia meant that he and the team held all three grand tour jerseys simultaneously.Others will exude a sigh of relief that, after next season, the Sky logo will no longer be seen on a group of riders lined out at the front of peloton, paid vast sums to act as super-domestiques, controlling the pace with a degree of tactical discipline previously seen only in the teams supporting Lance Armstrong – a tainted precedent, of course.So suffocating was their presence that for the 2018 season they changed the colour of their jerseys from black to white in an obviously symbolic attempt to improve the image of a team that had come to be seen, rightly or wrongly, as the sport’s bad guys. The decision to return to the original black for next year had already been made before Wednesday’s announcement of the title sponsor’s decision to withdraw support at the end of 2019.Race organisers, most obviously Christian Prudhomme of ASO, the owners of the Tour de France, at first welcomed Sky’s investment in a perennially underfunded sport, along with the enthusiasm of their British supporters. After that initial boost, however, they found themselves looking for ways to limit Sky’s success by reducing the size of all the teams from nine to eight in the guise of making the race safer for riders and spectators and musing about the possibility of banning the power meters which help the riders to follow the precise instructions of their sporting directors.Some will be shocked by the global broadcaster’s withdrawal. By cycling’s historic standards, however, Sky’s involvement has been a long one. Sponsors come and go, and even those whose teams enjoyed a period of near-absolute dominance – Bianchi with Fausto Coppi, Saint-Raphaël with Jacques Anquetil, Faema and Molteni with Eddy Merckx – did not stay long. Other famous names – Legnano, Peugeot, Raleigh, Système U, Panasonic, Banesto – all disappeared, although retaining a place in the hearts of nostalgia-prone cycling fans.When James Murdoch put Sky’s money into a British-based cycling project, his involvement was inspired by a personal enthusiasm for the sport. Like many wealthy young businessmen in the 2000s, he found cycling a superior alternative to golf, the preferred leisurebusiness interface of earlier generations. Gulping down a recovery drink at the summit of the Mont Ventoux was a more modern kind of fun than ordering a G\u0026ampT in the clubhouse at Wentworth. In Dave Brailsford he found a man who brought not just ambition and energy but vision and imagination to the plans they laid.In October this year, however, Murdoch left the board of Sky after the company was sold to Comcast. Since his departure a colder view is likely to have been taken of the commercial benefits of putting an annual sum of around £30m into a team whose reputation has been damaged by a wave of allegations that at one point forced Brailsford to appear before a parliamentary select committee.Sky’s legacy will be a mixed one. The enormous sum (perhaps approaching £200m) invested in Brailsford’s philosophy of marginal gains – which basically meant buying the best of everything, from the team bus to the riders’ pillows – helped raise cycling to a very different position in the national life, although it should never be forgotten that their success was built on the platform erected by the publicly funded Olympic programme run by British Cycling. A complex and in some ways opaque arrangement under which they shared facilities and expertise was brought under examination when the stories about the questionable use of TUEs emerged, along with the exposure of inadequate medical record-keeping.History will see the 10-year era of Team Sky as an object lesson in the dangers that accompanied Brailsford’s vision and ambition. His approach made cycling more professional while forfeiting some of its humanity and spontaneity, the very qualities cherished by so many of its adherents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ff6fc1de72fbe55967c5503ee41abb2d8c7442/0_48_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62f4b1973ee2554c287155f05850313","title":"yokozuna controversies and a dump truck a sumo history in pictures","story":"The origins of sumo date back 2,000 years and it was from the 17th century that saw its rise as a spectator sport.

The home button is gone, replaced with uniform bezels around the edges and a thin, squared-off aluminium body reminiscent of the iPhone 4’s gorgeous design.Fire up the screen and you are greeted with a beautiful display that is arguably the best LCD on any device, let alone a tablet. The question is whether you share Apple’s vision of what the next version of a computer should be and whether a large screen running a mobile operating system cuts the mustard.There are two starting with a slightly bigger 11in iPad Pro but it is the 12.9in version that is the most impressive and the one reviewed here. Where the previous 12.9in was fairly heavy and unwieldy, the shrinking of the body around the large screen has made it feel a lot smaller and easier to handle.The new tablet is a noticeable 49g lighter, 1mm thinner, 19.4mm shorter and 5.1mm narrower than its predecessor. At 631g and only 5.9mm in thickness the 12.9in iPad Pro is thinner and lighter than most of its productivity tablet competition, too. The 12.3in Microsoft Surface Pro weighs 770g and is 8.5mm thick, while Google’s 12.3in Pixel Slate is 726g and 7mm thick.The four speakers in the sides are loud and clear, putting most other tablets to shame. The industry-standard USB-C port replaces the old Lightning socket for power and connectivity. The new Apple Pencil magnetically attaches to and wirelessly charges from one side of the tablet, while the smart connector has been moved to the smooth aluminium back of the tablet.Apple says the 2018 iPad Pro is more powerful than the majority of mobile PCs sold in the last year, and I can well believe that, but I found it difficult to find any apps that actually use all that power.Affinity Photo was super-smooth even in complex image manipulation tasks and games were fluid but neither felt blisteringly faster than the previous iPad Pro.If you can get all your work done on an iPad Pro it will far outlast any Intel-powered laptop, let alone a tablet, but it takes 3.5 hours to fully charge using the included folding 18W USB-C charger when not in use. It will charge faster from a more powerful USB-C laptop charger.Apple’s Face ID recognition system replaces the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, squeezed into the bezel on the left edge. It works very well, despite the wider variety of angles you hold a tablet at compared to a smartphone.Only occasionally did I have to intentionally lean over the tablet to get it to see my face, or move my hand from blocking the camera when held in landscape. It feels far more natural than reaching for a fingerprint scanner on a tablet.If docked in the Smart Keyboard you can simply double tap the spacebar or any key to unlock and dismiss the lock screen taking a leaf out of Microsoft’s excellent Windows Hello system.The iPad Pro runs the same version of iOS as previous iPads and iPhones, with its large selection of third-party tablet apps, including great text editors and art programs, plus every media consumption app you could want. Digital comics look particularly good on the big, bright and brilliant screen.The side-by-side split-screen apps work well on the 12.9in screen, which is big enough to stay productive with half the screen per app. But when it comes to genuine productivity, iOS is often the thing holding the iPad Pro back.You can’t access removable storage, apart from to import photos. You can hook up a monitor but only use it beyond simple mirroring with certain functions such as presentations. There are many of these little irritations that aren’t a problem on macOS or Windows 10.The iPad Pro can do most things you would on Mac or a PC but you might need a hack or workaround. Fewer of these tricks are needed each year but one thing that hasn’t improved is Safari.It is a very good mobile browser but it isn’t desktop class. That’s fine for most things but trying to use a complex web app, the kind often needed when getting work done such as a content management system or similar, can be like pulling teeth.Perhaps the web app should be better designed but when it is primarily used in desktop-class browsers with mousing and multi-click support, the reality is that the tablet has to be able to handle the app a rather than the other way around. Particularly if it wants to be your only computer.Apple’s gesture navigation is second to none. All your favourites from the iPhone X are there. A short swipe up from the bottom reveals the dock, from which you can grab an app and go split screen. Swipe up further to reach the home screen, or swipe up and hold to go to the task switcher. Switch between apps by swiping across the gesture bar at the bottom.The classic iPad pinching gestures are still there, too. Pinch with four or more fingers to go straight to the task switcher. Swipe up with four or more fingers to go home, or left and right to switch to the next app.They are all incredibly smooth, feeling natural and intuitive for an all-screen device.Apple offers a new Pencil stylus costing £119, as the old Pencil is not compatible with the new iPad Pro. Gone is the daft-looking Lightning connector that you plugged directly into the iPad. It is replaced by magnets to attach it to the top of the tablet and wirelessly charge it - ready for action when you need it.It stayed mounted fairly well but can be knocked off easily when pulling the iPad out of a bag unless you’re careful.Double tap the barrel of the Pencil with your finger to switch between drawing and erasing, or similar. It’s app dependent, so your favourite app might not yet support it, but it works well in Apple Notes. It’s not quite as good as a button but it’s better than nothing.While the iPad Pro can be used with just about any Bluetooth keyboard, Apple sells a £199 Smart Keyboard Folio for the new iPad Pro, which acts like a case and clips the tablet and smart connector via magnets.It costs a lot but worked very well. I could instantly touch type on what feels very much like the keyboards on the current generation of Apple laptops.It’s sealed, so no debris is going to get under the keys, and it holds the tablet securely at one of two angles. It works great on a desk and is OK on a lap, feeling more stable than the previous generation of Apple Smart Keyboard.The iPad Pro comes in two screen sizes, four storage options and two variants with and without 4G connectivity.The wifi-only 11in iPad Pro costs £769 with 64GB of storage, £919 with 256GB, £1,119 for 512GB and £1,519 for 1TB. It costs £150 to add 4G to any of the storage versions.The wifi-only 12.9in iPad Pro costs £969 with 64GB of storage, £1,119 with 256GB, £1,319 for 512GB and £1,719 for 1TB. It costs £150 to add 4G capability to any of the storage versions, which is especially useful for working on the go, but requires another mobile broadband subscription.The Apple Pencil costs £119 and the Smart Keyboard Folio costs £179 for the 11in iPad Pro and £199 for the 12.9in iPad Pro.The new 12.9in iPad Pro is a remarkable piece of technology that rekindles that wow factor for me that most technology has lost. But it is exceedingly expensive if it is considered just a tablet.Apple claims the iPad is the evolution of the computer, and you can certainly get work done on it for double the length of time between charges than its competitors.But because of the intentional limitations of iOS, to get work done you need to make adjustments and use little hacks and workarounds you simply don’t have to on a desktop operating system. And really for something that costs upward of £969 it should adapt to you rather than the other way around.Yes, the iPad Pro is a computer but it’s not the best computer. It is the best, most desirable mobile tablet, and you’ll want one if you see one. But when the 9.7in iPad costs just £319 and works great for watching video, whether you should spend £769 for the 11in or £969 for the 12.9in version really comes down to how much you’re willing to spend on a luxury item. Because that’s what the iPad Pro is: a beautiful, luxury piece of kit.Pros: brilliant screen, long battery life, optional 4G, lots of tablet apps, USB-C, good speakers, Face ID, industry-leading gesturesCons: very expensive, iOS limitations, no kickstand without case, can’t fully replace a computer for everything This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The two streets are under an hour’s drive from each other.“This research lays bare the extent of the UK’s digital ide,” said Dani Warner, a broadband expert at uSwitch. “Streets that are relatively close geographically can be light years apart when it comes to the download speeds they are getting.”The report noted geographic trends. Nine of the streets with the slowest broadband were in North and South Yorkshire, Teeside, Manchester and across Scotland. Five of the streets with the fastest broadband were in south-west England.“Awareness continues to be the biggest hurdle to people getting faster download speeds,” said Warner. “On more than a third of the slowest streets people have no need to be crawling along on completely unusable internet services.”Ofcom says there are about 1.1 million “forgotten homes” that cannot access the ideal minimum speed of 10Mbps.The government has promised all homes and businesses will have a legal right to demand access to services offering speeds of at least 10Mbps by 2020. Broadband providers will face a legal requirement to provide this minimum standard to anyone requesting it, subject to a cost threshold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ede040c57c76f267a22e6b677e56779e2ad8cee/0_78_2354_1413/master/2354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c085051150414c51de9ae46182fc5bba","title":"seating plans playlists and cockle popcorn how to host this christmas","story":"The weather outside might be frightful, but there’s no reason why your party should be. From Christmas cocktail parties to sit-down dinners, here’s how to host with impact and ease this seasonThe nights have drawn in, George and Mariah are in a state of perpetual soundclash, and with them comes the unsettling urge to host a seasonal get-together.If you’re an unsteady host, even an intimate dinner with a handful of friends can seem daunting, so when you chuck in the plus-ones, her next door and a cluster of colleagues, that “fun and festive” party can start to feel anything but.But things don’t need to get all out of control and Abigail’s Party. We live in a time when fine dining and Michelin-starred chefs appear in the most casual of settings, and that informality extends to the at-home-host, too. Claude Bosi - head chef of Bibendum restaurant and Rémy Martin cognac bar – is one such Michelin-starred chef who advocates this relaxed approach when entertaining.“The key to a great party,” he says, “is to ensure you are with your guests. There are so many dinner parties where you try to impress and find yourself spending more time in the kitchen than you spend with your guests. A great party is a balance between good food and good hospitality.”Here’s how it’s done:The dinner partyThis casual mantra starts at the top – the formalities of the past have been dispensed with. Invites can go out on WhatsApp or email. Similarly, boy-girl seating plans at dinner are a relic of another time. Remember, too, if there are only two single guests at a dinner party, they don’t necessarily want to be seated together, lest they feel like show ponies being watched over by the other guests for signs of good chemistry. And unless you have a particular gift for crafting, there’s no need for place names.That said, some small details done nicely can make a real difference. Take your dinner table, for example, as chef and caterer Stephanie Boote says: “I like a simple table, not too much fuss. A linen cloth can be lovely, napkins, if you have them. A couple of little vases or bottles with flowers or foliage. Candlelight is a must. You can have a pile of plates and cutlery on top of an undressed table, a water jug and a stack of glasses, and if you have candles lit it will all be just fine!”There are lots of ways to make life easier as you prep your dinner-party meal, especially as your guests arrive and the heat rises in the kitchen. For Bosi, a neat trick is to go for a cold starter. He suggests getting a terrine from a local deli and serving it with a salad, all handily ready to go on plates ahead of time.Food writer and author Killian Fox offers similar logic when feeding a crowd. “Simplify,” he says. “Instead of a starter, lay out a range of snacks – decent crisps and dips, olives, maybe some crostini – for people to eat when they come through the door. Use the time you’ve saved to make sure everyone has enough booze.”Drinks are, of course, key to a great dinner party. Leave time at the beginning for an aperitif, which will give you more breathing room to prepare your food, take account of inevitable late arrivals (“our Uber kept cancelling”) and let appetites build.Fox suggests a handy seasonal cocktail, too, named London Calling. “It was apparently devised at Milk \u0026amp Honey in Soho. It’s citrussy, it contains sherry, and it gives you a chance to look classy with a cocktail shaker. A fine Christmas drink.”Bosi suggests a drink can offer some surprises and lead to unexpected food pairings. He likes a Royal Sidecar, made with Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal cognac, Cointreau and lemon – and paired with oysters.“Until recently, cognac was something you would have after a great lunch,” he says. “It’s not something you’re expecting to drink at the start of the meal, but I find it goes very well with seafood. It’s a nice surprise, a bit of creativity. At that moment, you’ve made people really relaxed and given your meal a stamp of quality.”From then on, you can go with some classic dishes: a big joint of meat, a casserole that can be easily cooked in advance, a beautiful stew with game, or Bosi’s festive favourite: beef wellington.When it comes to serving, Bosi tends to stick to sharing plates. “I put pots in the middle of the table and we start sharing,” he says. “I think dinner parties with people closer to each other are a better atmosphere.”Boote adds a word of practical advice: “Preparation is key. Your guests are here to see you, not have you run about trying to do things. Keep it simple, with excellent ingredients that speak for themselves.”Dinner party music has long been something of a slur, a byword for a pleasant but bland background soundtrack. But you don’t want to be sitting in silence accompanied only by the sound of mastication and scraping forks, so head to Spotify to put together some playlists.For dinner, you want something that is eclectic but not too distracting – you don’t want to be continually flicking to the next song. However, you also don’t want to drift into nondescript tastefulness, either.The drinks partyInteresting people, nice snacks, some decent tunes and plenty of booze is all that’s needed for a drinks party. Keep things loose – this means submitting to the inevitable and assuming a crowd will congregate in your kitchen. Be ready to push some seats away in the living room if a late dance party emerges.When it comes to the drinks, try to be creative, says Boote: “This year, we have made a fig leaf syrup to go with lime juice, gin and soda. It’s delicious without the gin, too.” She follows that adding clementine flavours and fizz to spirits makes any drink feel “festive and delicious”.Of course, guests will be looking for something to nibble on, so lay out some decent crisps, popcorn or olives.You can also add some more expansive finger food into the mix. Boote goes for gougères, a French choux pastry filled with cheese, while Bosi will be serving up some intriguing offerings: Rémy Martin cognac, mixed with tonic (a Rémy Grand Tonic – the French spin on the British classic), served with his “pickled cockle popcorn”. The cockles are rolled in flour then deep-fried in hot oil, coming out as if popcorn. “It’s a fantastic pairing,” he says. To give it a seasonal twist, add some clove or orange to the cognac.Fox offers a snack serving with a backstory: “The Gilda – a pintxo created in honour of Rita Hayworth, who starred in the film Gilda. It’s pretty easy: skewer a couple of green olives on a toothpick with guindilla peppers and an anchovy fillet.”You want to keep the music equally eclectic but a little more upbeat. However, don’t feel the need to overload it with bangers and floor fillers. If the party goes late, you can bring out the hits. Remember to let a few people try out their music selections – it’s never fun to be overprotective of the music at a party, nor do you want one person hogging the speaker. Finally, if things take a particularly boozy turn, fire up some karaoke through YouTube.And finally …Really, there’s no set formula. Follow your instincts, embrace comfort and concentrate on having fun. And, if in doubt, remember some salient words from Bosi:“Just don’t try too hard. Don’t try to impress is the wrong thing to say – you want to impress – but stay in your comfort zone. Stay comfortable, enjoy yourself, keep it simple – and have a good time.”Make like Bosi and kick off that good time with a Royal Sidecar or Rémy Grand Tonic of your own – buy a bottle here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9425f5b81f3dc73a33d4d83278462aaa4181fd7c/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfbed519ba607a04b1c62249fb1af8ea","title":"fairytale castles and secret forests discover germanys best kept secret","story":"Deep in the heart of Germany lies Thuringia – a state bursting with both cultural curiosities and unrivalled natural beautyExplore the wildernessThe 700-year-old Rennsteig trail traces a spectacular ridgeway through the Thuringian forest, and is a mecca for hikers and cyclists. Originally a trade route in the Middle Ages, the path is popular with both walkers wishing to get away for a while and cyclists up for a serious challenge. With 105 miles running from Bach’s birthplace, Eisenach, to the river Saale in Blankenstein, there is plenty to take in.Medieval wondersStrewn across Thuringia’s lush scenery are an incredible 400 castles and palaces. Queen Victoria, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha famously danced at Schloss Friedenstein, while Richard Wagner’s operatic masterpiece Tannhäuser was inspired by Wartburg Castle, now a Unesco world heritage site and home to a 9,000-strong treasure trove of European art. Erfurt, the state capital, is also worth a visit. Peek inside St Mary’s Cathedral, where the 16th century monk Martin Luther was ordained, before taking in Erfurt’s perfectly preserved medieval old town that’s most impressive.Art and cultureEver since a youthful Johann Wolfgang von Goethe arrived in the city of Weimar, flushed with success from his romantic bestseller The Sorrows of Young Werther, Thuringia has been a haven for artists, philosophers, musicians, innovators and reformers. Weimar’s numerous coffee houses were frequented by everyone from Johann Sebastian Bach to Friedrich Nietzsche, Wassily Kandinsky and Marlene Dietrich. The world-class design school Bauhaus opened in Weimar in 1919 – before moving to Dessau in 1925 – and next year’s centenary will be marked with a plethora of parties and special events, culminating in the grand opening of the new bauhaus museum weimar.Take a different viewPrize for the coolest place to see goes to the Carl Zeiss-Planetarium in Jena. The world’s oldest planetarium, built in 1926, features an impressive dome projection system where Pink Floyd and Queen provide the soundtrack to gas clouds and galaxies. And for holiday snaps unlike anyone else’s Instagram feed, visit Erfurt-Rieth: a concrete jungle of 1970s GDR architecture, complete with retro-futurist skywalks, plattenbau tower blocks, murals and sculptures.The best of the wurstIt would be remiss not to mention Thuringia’s legendary sausages – rostbratwursts, or “rosters” – which are one of the world’s most delicious things to put on a BBQ, slather in mustard and slap into a sliced roll. The marjoram and spices in these protected-designation-of-origin sausages bring them to life.

As part of this work, we have detected, investigated and taken action on a variety of abuse, including military-linked abuse.“We have banned 20 iniduals and organisations from Facebook in Myanmar, including Sen Gen Min Aung Hlaing, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and the military’s Myawaddy television network. We have also taken down pages and accounts that were covertly pushing the messages of the Myanmar military.”Another US tech company named on the list was Cloudflare, which is accused of providing cybersecurity infrastructure for Hlaing’s website.

He has not responded to the UN accusations.Speaking to the , Doug Kramer, general counsel at Cloudflare, said that “as an infrastructure company that doesn’t do anything with the content – doesn’t host it, doesn’t run it through algorithms, doesn’t recommend it – we think it is a dangerous situation for us to start passing judgment on content and taking action”.Kramer added: “We comply with our obligations under the law but we very strictly try to resist being pulled into becoming the arbiter about who should and who should not have cybersecurity online.”However, this year Cloudflare did choose to withdraw their services to the website of the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer, without legal intervention, following the killing of a young woman by a far-right activist in Charlottesville, Virginia, after the website claimed the company was an active supporter.Among the two UK companies on the list is HR Wallingford, a civil engineering organisation involved in the construction of Bhasan Char, an island in the Bay of Bengal where the government of Bangladesh plans to relocate 100,000 Rohingya. The plan has faced considerable objections from NGOs and human rights groups.A spokesperson from HR Wallingford said it had “no business activity in Myanmar”, adding: “Within neighbouring Bangladesh, the company has been engaged to design flood defences for Bhasan Char island to internationally recognised standards.”Nang San San Aye, a Burmese MP for Shan state, has pleaded for foreign countries to stop promoting and investing in dams in Myanmar’s war zones, saying: “It is fuelling conflict, and undermining efforts to seek peace.”Businesses from India, Japan, Korea, Belgium, Russia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand are also included on the list.“Companies which supply equipment to the military, or do business with the military, are complicit in the human rights violations committed by them,” said Mark Farmaner, the director of Burma Campaign UK. “We are not saying don’t do business in Burma we are saying don’t do business with the military.”In particular, the list demonstrates the extent to which China is supporting military projects and operations in Myanmar and the increasing Chinese investment in the country.The largest number of the companies named on the list are Chinese – 16 in total. According to the list, China is supplying the Burmese military with fighter jets, armed drones, ballistic missile systems, heavy machinery, navy warships and energy. Chinese companies were also cited by the list as being involved in at least six controversial dam projects in conflict zones in Myanmar and a coal mine.“We hope that being named on this list will prompt some companies to end their involvement with the military or operations linked to human rights and environmental problems,” said Burma Campaign UK. “In doing so, they act as a warning to other companies.”A UN fact-finding report released in August declared the Burmese military had “genocidal intent” during its violent crackdown on the Rohingya Muslims in Rahkine state, and that its actions “undoubtedly amounted to the gravest crimes under international law”.The report called for senior military figures to be brought before the international criminal court."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e43c85149e559e5fbd296d2aea4b305ef815d47/0_212_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9985fc9456829c3ceeac7db78b60953a","title":"twitter chief jack dorsey responds to criticism over amazing myanmar tour","story":"Company founder addresses his failure to mention Rohingya genocide after visiting various meditation retreatsTwitter’s chief executive and co-founder Jack Dorsey has responded to an avalanche of criticism for tweets promoting Myanmar as a tourist destination, stating that he did not intent to diminish the “the human rights atrocities and suffering” in the country.Jack Dorsey was accused of being “tone deaf” and an apologist for the Myanmar regime after documenting his travels last month where he visited and meditated at temples “across the country”. He urged people to visit Myanmar and to experience the “amazing food” and people who were “full of joy”.Responding to those who had criticised him for not mentioning the violent crackdown against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rakhine state, which a UN official described this year as an “ongoing” genocide, Dorsey said that was a “purely personal trip for me focused on only one dimension: meditation practice”.He added: “I’m aware of the human rights atrocities and suffering in Myanmar. I don’t view visiting, practicing, or talking with the people, as endorsement. I didn’t intend to diminish by not raising the issue, but could have acknowledged that I don’t know enough and need to learn more.”Dorsey said he had “no conversations with government or NGOs” during his trip and emphasised he had travelled to Myanmar as a devotee of vipassana meditation practice, which is still practised its original form in Myanmar.“I took this time with a singular objective of working on myself,” he added. “I shared my experience with the world with the singular objective of encouraging others to consider a similar practice. Simply because it’s the best thing I’ve found to help me every day.”In August 2017, a military-led crackdown against the Rohingya saw thousands killed, villages razed to the ground and women raped and assaulted. More than 700,000 people were driven over the border to Bangladesh to seek safety.A UN fact-finding mission recently concluded that the military had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Rakhine and had “genocidal intent” in the actions against the Rohingya. Conditions in Rakhine for the remaining Rohingya remain oppressive, where they are still subjected to continued discrimination and abuse, with many still fleeing across the border or on boats to Malaysia and Indonesia.Dorsey used his tweets to state that Twitter was “actively” working in Myanmar on ensuring it was not used as a platform for “violent extremism and hateful conduct”.“We know we can’t do this alone, and continue to welcome conversation with and help from civil society and NGOs within the region,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3728841.1544622058!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"largest meteor shower of the year to cross irish skies","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Gemenids, the meteor shower which will cross Ireland this week, over Bulgaria in 2015.

Photograph: Tom Honan.When it comes to Christmas shopping, Irish consumers are savvy, bargain hunters with a selfless streak and a tendency to go over budget, according to a festive survey published on Wednesday morning. The research from Bank of Ireland suggests seven in 10 people seek the best value when Christmas shopping, with a similar number saying they resist the temptation to buy for themselves when shopping for others. Making savings appears to be an important part of the present-planning process with 69 per cent saying they seek out bargains with price discounts and the use of loyalty schemes serving as the greatest incentives for budget-conscious consumers. In the bid to stick to budgets, 70 per cent hold back from treating themselves while those who do have a “one for you, one for me” mentality’ or are most likely to treat themselves to new pyjamas or a new outfit for Christmas Day.However, the survey also says all the altruism can lead to overspending with one in three consumers saying they always spend more than they intended on Christmas gifts in spite of the fact that 31 per cent set rigid budgets when planning their Christmas shopping. Around 20 per cent of consumers still go in search of last-minute miracles and battle through the shops in the last days of the shopping season and inevitably end up paying over the odds and breaking their budgets as a result. Presents aside, 64 per cent of respondents said they would spend most of their money on food and drink with clothes and accessories said to be the second biggest expense followed by entertainment and travel. The spend on entertainment is set to average €267 per person with eating and drinking out costing the average Irish consumer €180 per person. People will spend an average of €41 on taxies while there is also likely to be an increase in the number of adults eating takeaway food over the Christmas period, with the expected average amount of these tasty treats totalling €46 per person.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireFileBusinesses along the Border have already closed as a result of Brexit, an Oireachtas committee has heard. Pamela Arthurs, chief executive of the East Border Region, a local authority led cross-Border network, said in particular small rural businesses are being affected. “Businesses, particularly on this side of the Border, so many have closed – the small, the micro, the mushroom industry for example . . . they’re going now. We need to look at this,” she told the Rural and Community Development Committee on Wednesday. A number of cross-Border organisations were addressing the Oireachtas committee on Brexit challenges facing Border businesses. Ms Arthurs said businesses in the region are “less confident and more reluctant to expand as the future is so uncertain”. “Current developments at Westminster have compounded the problem,” she said. Ms Arthurs also said there must be “strategic intervention” to assist the cross-Border region. “If you take EU funding out of cross-Border activity, no one funds it. There is a small amount of money from the Department of Foreign Affairs here, that is it. It has never really been taken seriously,” she said. Shane Campbell, chief executive of the Irish Central Border Area Network said broadband is “absolutely critical” in order to open up rural life along the Border. “The delivery of the national broadband plan has to be key and has to be critical. We can’t afford to sit on it again now for another six years, otherwise Ireland loses its place,” he said. Mr Campbell said the Border region had “pre-existing issues” before Brexit that are still not being addressed. He said EU funding programmes such as PEACE, LEADER and Interreg have all been “very important” but “they’ve been sticky plaster solutions onto an area and an issue which is huge”. Dr Anthony Soares, deputy director of the Centre for Cross Border Studies said it is “essential” that EU funding for North-South and cross-Border co-operation is secured for the next programming period. “It is of paramount importance that legal guarantees are give that any future PEACE PLUS programme will encompass the Border counties of Ireland, will be of a significant contribution, of at least 15 per cent of any total budget, to cross-Border co-operation,” he said. Dr Soares said even as the UK’s official exit from the EU rapidly approaches “it is still unclear as to what the scale and nature of the impact will be on Border communities and business”. Aidan Campbell from the Rural Community Network said broadband connectivity and an adequate road network are a pre-requisite to encourage young people to remain and return to rural Border communities. He said many of these communities are still recovering from the legacy of the Troubles. Sinn Féin TD Martin Kenny said Brexit has “totally destroyed” the potential that existed in the cross-Border region. He said funding over the years “has never been enough” and instead “just enough to manage”. Labour TD Willie Penrose said “areas are nothing without their people and people won’t be there unless there’s something to provide gainful employment for them”.

Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty Images.UK Conservative MP Anna Soubry has apologised to the Irish people for the actions of her party and government in the Brexit debacle. Anna Soubry has said she is “acutely appalled” at the no confidence vote in prime minister Theresa May. May will face a vote of confidence in her leadership on Wednesday evening after more than 48 of her MPs wrote to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee calling for a challenge.Ms May will address Conservative MPs at 5pm and voting will take place in a secret ballot between 6pm and 8pm, with a result expected before 10pm.In a statement outside Number 10 on Wednesday morning, Ms May said: “I will contest that vote with everything I’ve got.”A planned trip to Dublin to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has been cancelled, with Ms May instead remaining in London “to make the case for my leadership with my parliamentary colleagues”.Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Ms Soubry said:“I can only apologise to your listeners for what my country and my party has been doing for the last few years. Not even the Conservative party could be so politically irresponsible at this critical stage with the most important decision since the end of World War 2.”The no confidence vote is coming from a group of far right Brexiteers who have “blighted the Conservative party for decades,” she added.It was a shame that they could not be seen off, the party is now reaping the consequences of that, Ms Soubry said.Theresa May “has got to bring this blasted vote back to the House of Commons” and has to have “a people’s vote, to take this mess back to the British people.”It is “the most irresponsible thing to do to change leader” at this time, she said. “It won’t make Brexit go away.” There is a danger that the Conservative party could end up with Boris Johnson as leader, she warned.“These wretched people can’t face up to Brexit reality.”Ms Soubry said she did not have a problem being a rule taker not a rule maker within the EU “if that is the price we have to pay for peace and British business.”She described the signatories of the letter calling for a vote of no confidence in Theresa May as being like children. “They can’t get their own way, so they stamp their feet. They need to grow up.“Let the British people vote.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK prime minister Theresa May walks back to number 10 after making a statement in Downing Street. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire Theresa May’s defiant statement outside 10 Downing Street, promising to fight “with everything I’ve got” to keep her job, set out the case she will make to Conservative MPs ahead of tonight’s confidence vote.A leadership election now would mean that her successor would not be in place until at least the middle of January, too late to renegotiate the Brexit deal in time for a parliamentary deadline of January 21st.This could mean extending the Article 50 negotiating deadline so that Britain would not leave the European Union as planned on March 29th. Delaying Brexit could mean abandoning it, she warned, if Parliament takes control of the process and triggers a second referendum.Hardline Brexiteers within the European Research Group (ERG) failed last month to win the support of the 48 MPs needed to call a confidence vote. May’s decision to postpone the vote on her Brexit deal changed the arithmetic, prompting more Brexiteers and some Remainers to conclude that she lacked the authority to deliver a Brexit deal that can win a majority in Parliament.If May wins tonight, she is immune from a challenge to her leadership for 12 months, a factor that could play against her in tonight’s ballot. Many MPs who declined to move against her by triggering a confidence vote would, none the less, like her to leave office shortly after Britain leaves the EU at the end of March. And Conservatives are united in their determination that they should not go into another general election under her leadership.The ERG’s leaders have deployed the DUP against the prime minister, warning that the unionist party will withdraw its support from the government unless the Conservatives choose a new leader. For their part, the DUP have long been plotting to remove May and her defeat tonight would help to burnish their reputation for ruthlessness at Westminster.For the ERG, May’s successor must be a Brexiteer and if she loses, the group will stage a mini-hustings to choose a candidate - probably Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab or David Davis. MPs choose two candidates who then go before the broader party membership and the Brexiteers fear that splitting their vote could allow two former Remainers to go forward to the final contest.Within the cabinet, home secretary Sajid Javid and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt are former Remainers who have swung behind Brexit since the referendum. Both publicly expressed support for the prime minister this morning, along with other ministers with leadership ambitions.May’s opponents need 158 votes to topple her and some of them acknowledge that they will struggle to reach that number. That’s why Brexiteers have this morning suggested that, if the prime minister fails to win the vote by a wide margin, she will have to step down.They point to the precedent of Margaret Thatcher in 1990, when she won 204 votes to Michael Heseltine’s 152 but was forced to resign. But five years later, when a third of Conservative MPs voted against John Major in his “back me or sack me” confidence vote, he remained in office.If the prime minister’s statement outside Downing Street this morning is anything to go by, if she wins tonight’s vote by any margin, she will stay put.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

It is based on well-considered and substantial philosophical thinking.Dr Suzanne Owen, a reader of religious studies at Leeds Trinity University, supported the argument and said Mr Casamitjana “has a very strong case.”Dr Owen, who assisted members of the Druid Network in 2010 when they successfully argued that they were a religion to the Charity Commission, said: “Veganism can be coherently presented as a belief, because of the ethical dimension that Mr Casamitjana can, and probably will, articulate.In 2010, the Druid Network successful argued to the Charity Commission that they were a religion“There is lots of literature that can inform his view on veganism as an ethical belief and there is definitely enough for him to draw on to form a case.“Veganism is more than just a lifestyle choice. It has got a whole orientation and practice. These beliefs inform a way of practice and I think that’s what makes it a belief, rather than a viewpoint. It informs how you behave and how you relate to others.According to Dr Owen, the only test that Ms Casamitjana’s ethical veganism case might struggle to pass is that it must be “a belief, not an opinion or viewpoint based on the present state of information available.”“It’s about whether it’s belief or an opinion, which is the area that will be the hardest for the case to decide upon. There are strong beliefs involved with those who are ethical vegans, so it depends on how they present their case,” Dr Owen added.Jordi Casamitjana pictured protesting against Bullfighting during a demonstration march which ended outside the Spanish embassy in LondonMr Casamitjana said the hearing was not primarily about his dismissal, but about establishing ethical veganism as a philosophical belief.He added: Although the manner in which I was dismissed was intensely distressing for me, some good may come of it if I am able to establish this valuable protection for all ethical vegans.If we are successful in that hearing, we will then proceed to a hearing on the specifics of my dismissal.But the League Against Cruel Sports said it “fairly dismissed” Mr Casamitjana for gross misconduct and that linking the decision to his veganism was factually wrong.In a statement posted on their website, they said: “The Claimant in this case was dismissed for gross misconduct and for failing to follow express management instructions that were given to him.  “This had nothing to do with his beliefs, protected or otherwise.  In view of the lack of service to bring an ordinary unfair dismissal claim, the Claimant is making a desperate attempt to link his fair dismissal to his stated belief in ‘ethical veganism’ which the League Against Cruel Sports categorically refutes.”Commenting on Mr Casamitjana\u0027s claim that their pension fund was being invested into companies that tested on animals, a spokesman said: “In 2015 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) changed their guidelines regarding opt-in pension schemes and none of the ethical pension funds available to us could be used for auto-enrollment.Theresa May no confidence vote: 160 Tory MPs vow to back PM - enough to win tonight\u0026#39s crunch ballotWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

In November, Google acquired a 51.8-acre space in Mountain View for a reported $1 billion, making it the largest real estate transaction in the Bay Area in 2018.The acquisition gave Google greater power to redevelop and renovate the land beside its sprawling headquarters.Bayshore\u0027 (Google)The development proposal, first reported by CNBC, includes a Jobs-Housing Balance Policy that calls for a 4:1 ratio of housing to office space, while simultaneously making\u0026nbspthe North Bayshore neighbourhood a welcoming destination for people to visit.Transforming a suburban office park into vibrant new neighbourhoods also means taking a comprehensive approach to transportation and mobility – one that encourages people to get out of their cars, the proposal states.And better mobility options can have big outcomes: improving public health, changing behaviour, alleviating congestion, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle miles travelled, improving safety for cyclists and pedestrians, and simply creating great public places.Google will work with the City of Mountain View over the following months to review the proposal in the hope of getting approval to realise the project within the next 10 to 15 years.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Our updated approach means the public will be better able to make informed choices about CAM charities and whether they wish to support them or use their services.”He added: “Our review was not about whether CAM is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ or should be made available through public health provision – that is a matter for others. And nor do we expect our outcome necessarily to please all those with strong views about CAM generally. Our focus is on the integrity of the register of charities. We know the public place value on the concept of charity, and we must ensure that the register of charities is accurate and that only organisations that are, in law, charities are registered as such.”In the Charity Commission’s response to the consultation on CAM status, the organisation wrote: “Registration of a charity is acceptance that the organisation meets the legal test for being a charity, including that it is established for exclusively charitable purposes for the public benefit. Public benefit is based on evidence. In registering a CAM organisation as a charity we are not endorsing any treatment or confirming its efficacy but confirming that the organisation meets the test for charitable status including that of benefit to the public.”There is no universally agreed definition of what constitutes a CAM, and practices such as massage, acupuncture, tai chi, and drinking green tea may all be considered as such.NHS stops funding homeopathy at major alternative medicine hospitalThe British Homeopathic Association (BHA), a charity which aims to encourage and enable patient access to homeopathic remedies, appears not to be concerned about the results of the review.Cristal Sumner, chief executive of the BHA, told The Independent: “As a patient focused charity we are pleased to see the emphasis of the Charity Commission’s long-awaited outcome report is about ensuring that CAM organisations are subject to the same governance and legal requirements as other charities on the register.“The BHA was established in 1902 and our charitable status is not only a fundamental part of our identity, it also means that members of the public can have confidence that we are meeting the public benefit and legal requirements set by our governing body.”Homeopathic treatments are separate from science-based western medicine, and are based on ideas developed by German doctor Samuel Hahnemann in the 1790s\u0026nbspand early 1800s.Hahnemann’s key principles are based on theories that a substance which causes particular symptoms can also be used to take away those symptoms. This is usually done through a process of dilution and shaking\u0026nbspcalled “succession”. Remedies may often therefore be made from a substance that has been repeatedly diluted with water, until there is almost none, or absolutely none of the original substance remaining.Created with Sketch.NHS at 70: Pride and worry as free health service celebrates birthday Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nurses test the hearing of a newborn childThe waiting room is busy in Milton Keynes University HospitalOn Ward 24, two nurses work at the nurses stationIn A\u0026ampE, a porter rushes a patient through the corridorA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationIn the physiotherapy department, patients are treated in the hydrotherapy poolIn the physiotherapy department, amputees take a classA junior doctor is at work in the staff roomA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationAn inpatient has her hair washed by the staff hairdressersIn the audiology department, a mother watches on as her son is given a hearing testOn Ward 8, staff serve lunch to the patientsOn Ward 24, a patient waits on their bedOn Ward 8, a cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalNurses test the hearing of a newborn childThe waiting room is busy in Milton Keynes University HospitalOn Ward 24, two nurses work at the nurses stationIn A\u0026ampE, a porter rushes a patient through the corridorA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationIn the physiotherapy department, patients are treated in the hydrotherapy poolIn the physiotherapy department, amputees take a classA junior doctor is at work in the staff roomA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationAn inpatient has her hair washed by the staff hairdressersIn the audiology department, a mother watches on as her son is given a hearing testOn Ward 8, staff serve lunch to the patientsOn Ward 24, a patient waits on their bedOn Ward 8, a cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalCommon ailments homeopathy is said to “treat”, include a broad spectrum of physical and psychological conditions including bruises, toothaches, nausea, coughs and colds, asthma and depression.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Our competitors have become masters at exploiting the seams between peace and war what constitutes a weapon in this ‘grey zone’, below the threshold of conventional war, no longer has to go ‘bang’.”He pointed to a worrying lack of knowledge or interest among the public about how current geopolitical issues have evolved.“Of course, people don’t really study history any longer,” he said, pointing to a\u0026nbsprecent survey of 2,000 people about the First World War. “Fifty per cent thought Winston Churchill was the prime minister at the time, and 10 per cent\u0026nbspthought it was Margaret Thatcher\u0026nbsp20 per cent\u0026nbspthought we were fighting the French\u0026nbsp6 per cent\u0026nbspthought it was President Kennedy’s assassination that triggered the war.\u0026nbspAnd when asked what the bloodiest battle of the war was, 16 per cent\u0026nbspvoted for Pearl Harbour, 8 per cent\u0026nbspfor Independence Day, 7 per cent\u0026nbspfor Hastings and 5 per cent\u0026nbspfor Helm’s Deep – yes that’s 100 of the 2,000 who were asked – who thought it was a battle in the Lord of the Rings trilogy”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Armed police restrain a man inside the grounds of the Houses of Parliament in LondonA demonstrator dressed as Theresa May sells Brexit Fudge in Old Palace Yard, WestminsterA pro-brexit demonstrator speaks into a megaphone at the Brexit betrayal march in London.

We no longer have the same depth of mutual understanding, and the tried and tested diplomatic instruments and conventions that used to be a feature of international relations, such as confidence-building measures, arms-reduction negotiations, public monitoring and inspection of each other’s military activity, are not what they once were.”In purely military terms, he stated: “Countries like Russia and China have studied our strengths and invested carefully in new methods and capabilities that are designed to exploit weaknesses: cyber\u0026nbspballistic and cruise missiles low-yield nuclear weapons space and counterspace weapons electronic warfare integrated air and missile defence systems multi-barrelled thermobaric rocket launchers linked digitally to drone targeting systems new conventional capability such as low-signature submarines, modern aircraft and armoured vehicles.”These are the Brexit security risks you really need to worry aboutWhen it comes to sophisticated weapons, “worryingly, many of these systems are now in the hands of proxy states. No longer can we guarantee our freedom of action from air or sea and on land”, he said.Looking to the future, Gen Carter said: “We will need to be clear in a post-Brexit\u0026nbspworld what role we want to play in the world – for example, is our ambition to be globally deployable or global? And what level of activity should we plan for? We have to find the right balance between ‘fight tonight’ and ‘fight tomorrow’, as this is essential for the long-term sustainability of our armed forces.”The government’s\u0026nbspModernising Defence Programme, due to be made public soon, said Gen Carter, has sought to address the\u0026nbspchallenges. “We need to mobilise to meet today’s threats we must modernise to meet future threats and we must transform ourselves to become the agile and adaptive organisation that the future demands,” he said.Chief of the Defence StaffShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This occurred after hydraulic fracturing had finished for the day. According to recent research by the University of Liverpool the impact would be like dropping a melon.

Well integrity has been checked and verified.”The company began pumping again this week after spending November working through their “wider hydraulic fracturing plan”, including conducting tests and analysis at the site.Environmental groups have passionately opposed the Lancashire site, which marks the first time fracking has taken place in the UK for seven years.“Within a day of Cuadrilla restarting fracking in Lancashire, there has already been another earthquake which means they’ve had to down tools,” said\u0026nbspFriends of the Earth campaigner Tony Bosworth.“It appears that they cannot frack without triggering tremors. And instead of acknowledging that fracking needs to end, Cuadrilla are instead urging for regulations around earthquakes to be relaxed.“We’ve always said that fracking poses risks for our climate and environment. After today’s quake, and with the effects of climate breakdown already happening around us, isn’t it time to put a stop to fracking once and for all?”While the most recent event was the largest\u0026nbsprecorded since fracking restarted, it is not as large as the two quakes that triggered a moratorium on the technique in 2011, one of which measured 2.3.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

But, since then, the Mr\u0026nbspPichai\u0026nbsphas held closed door meetings with members of\u0026nbspCongress\u0026nbspto discuss what Republicans have branded as liberal bias at Google.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialFollow updates from the hearing below and watch a\u0026nbsplive stream of the testimony here.Hello and welcome to our live blog of the congressional testimony of Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\u0026nbspWe are waiting on Mr Pichai to arrive.In attendance in Washington today is Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist who has had plenty of problems with social media over the past year.\u0026nbspJones was in attendance the last time tech CEOs came to testify before Congress, and tends to get into squabbles with folks on a regular basis.\u0026nbspWe\u0027ll see if any Jones news comes out of today\u0027s hearing when the Judiciary Committee calls a recess.Mr Goodlatte has opened the hearing, and recognized House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy as a witness.\u0026nbspMr McCarthy has thanked Mr Pichai, and called Google one of the most valuable companies in the world.Mr McCarthy cited a\u0026nbspWall Street Journal\u0026nbspstatistic that said that 90 per cent of internet searches goes through Google.\u0026nbspHe has also said that there is a widening gap of trust between users and technology companies. He went on to suggest that political biases must not seep into Google\u0027s search product.Chairman Goodlatte says that Google is able to collect an amount of data that would make the NSA blush.\u0026nbspHe said that most Americans probably have no idea how much information Google might be collecting about them when they use the platform.Chairman Goodlatte has now said he is interested in how Google handles objectionable content.\u0026nbspHe also has mentioned algorithmic screening, and the dangers that tinkering with that system could have. He then claimed that some Google employees have considered tinkering with the algorithm.Chairman Goodlatte is hitting on a lot of issues here, and has now mentioned that Android smartphones are able to collect a massive amount of data from users during the course of the day.\u0026nbspThat includes tracking data on movement, and even the mode of transport that someone may take.Ranking member Jerry Nadler is now giving his opening remarks, after Mr Goodlatte thanked Mr Pichai for attending the hearing.\u0026nbspMr Nadler has called the idea that Google and other tech companies have anti-conservative bias a fantasy. He said that he expects Republicans to bring up anecdotes, but that they will provide little evidence of an anti-conservative bias.\u0026nbspMr Nadler, on the other hand, has suggested that they should be concerned about online efforts to spread disinformation. He referenced the 2016 election, in which Russia attacked the US elections in favour of President Donald Trump.Mr Pichai is describing his childhood and the changes that technology had on his life before he moved to the United States 25 years ago.\u0026nbspHe has been the CEO of Google for the past three years.Mr Pichai is noting that Google is a major driver of jobs in the US, and that the company is able to help businesses all across the country.\u0026nbspHe noted that the company drives a massive portion of the US economy. He also said that Google works with the government.\u0026nbspI\u0027m proud to\u0026nbspsay that we do and we will continue to work with the government to keep our company safe and secure, Mr Pichai said.Mr Goodlatte has asked if Android phones send information to servers every few minutes, including location, altitude, temperature, and other data points.\u0026nbspMr Pichai has said that Google goes out of its way to give people the ability to control their privacy.\u0026nbspHe said that users have a choice on what data they send, and that some apps — like fitness apps — require certain data collection.Mr Pichai has said that Google offers privacy checkups in order for users to review what information Google collects on them.\u0026nbspHe said that users are able to review data and then to decide if data is stored or\u0026nbsp deleted. He also said that users can take their data with them if they choose to use other services.\u0026nbspWe want to make this work in a sustainable way, Mr Pichai said of platforms like YouTube, and ensuring that the content is agreeable.Please allow a moment for the live blog to updateShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Let’s look forward with confidence.”Javid has said he will launch a leadership challengeTheresa Mays Brexit deal collapses and shes ousted as Prime Minister, which is a strong possibility now she faces a vote of no confidence this evening.He has reportedly begun to gather support from ministers and is creating a team to help him bid to become the first non-white PM.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson are reported to also be seeking support for their own leadership bids.One Cabinet minister told The Sun: “Sajid is tapping us up. He is very direct, but he’s not offering jobs yet, which wouldn’t be a good look”.Another senior Tory disclosed: “He told me that Theresa’s Brexit deal is s***, she’ll be forced out when it falls, and he is then going to declare immediately”.Javid has said he would support a no-deal Brexit and has been backed by leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom.The government has been rocked by the scandal of Windrush-generation immigrants who have been treated as criminals by the Home Office despite living here legally for decades.Commonwealth citizens were encouraged to move to Britain from the s to s, but many were later unable to prove their right to be here. Some lost jobs, were denied healthcare or were threatened with deportation.Mr Javid said his family could easily have been caught up in the same situation after moving to the UK half a century ago.He told The Sunday : “I thought that could be my mum, my dad, my uncle ...it could be me.”He added: “I was really concerned when I first started hearing and reading about some of the issues.It immediately impacted me. I’m a second-generation migrant.My parents came to this country from Pakistan, just like the Windrush generation.”His comments heaped more pressure on Ms Rudd, but he also defended the government, urging people to look at the bigger picture and his colleagues efforts to put things right.After being made Home Secretary he said his most urgent task is sorting out the Windrush mess and his immigration policy will be fair and will treat people with respect and decency.The Sun revealed how Mr Javid grew up on Britain’s most crime ridden street, which led to his brother Bas Javid joining the police.Bas is now a chief superintendent in the West Mids Police Force, and his brother drew on the coppers  years of force experience in his first major speech.Describing his shock at the abuse he saw hurled at his brother as he tried to work, Sajid said: Over the years, I’ve heard what he has to say about policing.I know the tricky situations he’s been in.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000447667044.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk mosque welcomes preachers who support islamist assassin linked to case of christian mum asia bibi","story":"The Jamia Islamia Ghousia Trust in Luton invited the radical preachers to speak at its centre over the last month.They are Muhammad Ramzan Sialvi, from Pakistan, who spoke at Lutons central mosque last week and had been previously pictured kissing the corpse of Pakistani assassin Mumtaz Qadri in .Another, Hamid Saeed Kazmi, also attended Qadris funeral and has called for Ms Bibi to be re-jailed because authorities cannot compromise on any slights made against the prophet.Qadri, an elite police commander, murdered a politician in  over his support of Christian mum Ms Bibi, , who was sentenced to death in Pakistan on blasphemy charges.Last month we reported how Prime Minister Theresa May is said to have blocked a bid by Cabinet ministers including Home Secretary Sajid Javid to offer Ms Bibi asylum in the UK.Reports have also emerged of mullahs in Pakistan hunting Ms Bibi and her family door-to-door forcing them into hiding.The Roman Catholic from Punjab in Pakistan had been sentenced to death in  after she was accused of insulting the Prophet Mohammed - which she denies - with the conviction overturned in October.She had been picking berries when she was accused of being unclean by her Muslim co-workers and later alleged to have defiled the name of Mohammed in an argument.Pakistani politician Salmaan Taseer had spoken for reforming blasphemy laws in light of Ms Bibis case before he was shot  times by Qadri, one of his personal bodyguard, in .Qadri was arrested and convicted over the assassination before he was hanged in .But a host of radical clerics praised the killer as a martyr including several invited to the Jamia Islamia mosque in central Luton, Beds.Preacher Sialvi described it as a privilege to be able to kiss Qadris body at his funeral and that it had been a memorable moment in my le to send off the honourable gentleman.Last month the Luton mosque billed him in an advert as a special guest and a great scholar attending an afternoon prayer session.And three weeks ago another radical cleric Mr Kazmi - who supported assassin Qadri and has attacked the release of Ms Bibi - was invited as part of a group of speakers to a conference at the mosque in Luton.Haras Rafiq, chief executive of anti-extremist think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said: Theyare supporting a guy who murdered a politician because he felt the politician wasnt Muslim enough.All Taseer said was Pakistan needs to look at reforming the blasphemy law with [Bibis] case in question - and since then shes been vindicated.A mosque will not invite somebody who they disagree with. They only invite people they fundamentally agree with.Should they invite people who support publicly the murder of someone  because they consider them not to be Muslim enough  A second question is do they actually agree with these people The conference was also attended by Gary Forsyth, the deputy chief constable of Bedfordshire police, who thanked the mosque for his invitation.The Jamia Islamia mosque in Luton has previously been blasted by MPs for hosting radical preachers who support the persecution of minorities.They include Mufti Mohammed Han Qureshi who spoke in  and had been named by Pakistani police as the inspiration behind assassin Qadris murder.The trust is also a registered charity with an income of £, to the year ending in March and total funds of £.million.Ms Bibi had spent eight years in solitary confinement before her conviction was quashed in October.On the day villagers seized her she was paraded with a leather noose round her neck, beaten with sticks and told her le would only be sparedshe converted to Islam.The Foreign Office said a “number of countries” are currently in discussions to provide her with a “safe destination”.It is thought Australia has made an offer to the family.The Jamia Islamia Ghousia Trust said it was not aware of the preachers views and nor had they been shared at the mosque.It added in a statement that it had ensured that there are never any speeches supporting any sort of violence, under any circumstance for community cohesion and because the Quran describes the Prophet of Islam as a Mercy to the whole of Mankind and not just for Muslims."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000454897912.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"if we have a peoples vote on brexit itll be the end of the uks democracy","story":"After this week, I reckon the biggest vote for anything in British history — the ,, votes to leave the European Union — no longer matters a damn.One way or another, the British establishment is going to contrive to keep this country inside the EU.“Parliament speaks on behalf of the British people,” proclaimed the SNP’s Peter Grant, such a self- evident lie that it could have come straight from George Orwell’s .War is peace!

The French would come for our fish and our banks. The Germans would want concessions on EU immigration.Other countries would want more money.It would be a nightmare negotiation. So why do my friends think they must vote for it Because they believe that there is no alternative: that we may not like what has happened – but that we have run out of time and run out of road.It is crucial to understand that this pessimism is just flat wrong.If this deal is voted down on Tuesday – and I devoutly hope it is - we need to do two big things.First we need to change the Withdrawal Agreement, keeping all the sensible things that have been agreed on citizens’ rights, but getting rid of the “backstop” agreement on the Northern Irish border.We should use the so-called transition period both to negotiate a big and generous zero tarf zero quota free trade deal, and to solve the technical problems posed by the Northern Ireland border.There is no reason why we should not use that time – almost two years – to put in place the systems that will allow our whole country to come out of both the customs union and the single market, which is what the people were promised both at the referendum and the general election.We should be clear that we will keep back at least half of the £billion until the free trade deal is done.And second it is time now to show our EU friends that we mean business.This should be a take it or leave it offer – and so show that we mean business we must be able to walk away.This is a great country, capable of rising to immense challenges – and I believe the people of this country are fed up to the back teeth of being told by their government that they are simply incapable of managing the logistical problems of Brexit, when for two and a half years this government has studiously and deliberately failed to address those logistical problems.It is that failure and that lack of resolve that has so weakened our hand in the talks.Now is the time to get on with it – and remember,we have to go down this route, we will have the entire £billion to spend on it.We need to get our ports ready, hire the staff, ensure that the planes can fly and that companies are helped to transfer their data under any circumstances.I don’t believe for a moment that our EU friends and partners want such an outcome.They have a £ billion surplus with us in goods alone.They don’t want barriers to trade.They want a deal as much as we do.Do you really think that the people of the Calais region would be gratefulthe Paris government took steps to block commercial traffic from the UK Have you seen what is going on in France No one wants disruption of any kind – and the way to avoid it is to get ready to manage it now, with energy and conviction.We can still get a great deal, and I am sure we will.

No s and no buts.In June , . million people voted for Brexit, more than for any political party in British history. Over two years later, it’s time to settle the squabbles and get on with the job.I want MPs to support the Prime Minister’s agreement on Tuesday because it offers the surest path to Brexit.The alternatives – a second referendum or no Brexit at all – would fly in the face of the will of the British people. Instead of honouring and respecting the referendum, politicians would be ignoring the result.Pulling out of the EU is a hugely complex task. Leaving a bloc that we joined nearly  years ago, while staying friends with its members, means that everyone has to compromise.Some people legitimately say that the Withdrawal Agreement is not perfect, but it offers the most practical way of doing what the British electorate want.People voted to take back control of our borders, laws and money. This deal fulfils those instructions, while protecting jobs and the integrity of our United Kingdom.If you are in the EU, you have to accept the automatic right of any citizen of any other member state to live and work in your country.This agreement will end that situation and restore the British Government’s power to decide who should settle in our country. We will admit people with the right skills for our economy, regardless of their background.Britain is generous and tolerant, so the rights of EU citizens already living here will be protected, along with the rights of Britons residing in the EU.We will also stop making vast annual payments to the EU, allowing the British Government to decide on public spending priorities.As I know from my previous job, this Government’s priority is the NHS.

It is catastrophic defeat.The PM could immediately face a vote of no confidence triggered by power-hungry Labour.The Parliamentary arithmetic means that she could narrowly lose this vote — evenshe manages to win the support of every MP on the Conservative benches behind her.It would raise the terrying prospect of Corbyn and his rag-tag band of half-baked Marxists in Downing Street.Not only will Corbyn fritter away the country’s hard-won economic and social progress but he will also pursue policies which are a disgraceful betrayal of Brexit and millions of his own voters.In the face of the dismaying scenario before her, the PM has no choice but to postpone Tuesday’s crucial vote on her deal.It will be dficult and humiliating.But it will give her vital breathing space at Thursday’s EU summit to address the grievous concerns over her backstop proposal.Even the most blinkered of Brussels Eurocrats, whose intransigence so far has led to this crisis, must realise that such a concession is as much in their interests as ours.Mrs May has often stressed her determination to act in the national interest.Does she really think it is best for this country to press on with a vote which could hand victory to Jeremy Corbyn Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If so, we need to massively ramp up preparation for a clean break.Why wouldn’t the EU come up with a sensible compromise Because this is a club of ideological bullies whose commitment to the project is far more important to them than the interests of their own citizens.They want us to hold a second referendum, so we make the “right” choice.But another ballot would be a disaster for trust in our democracy.The arrogance of those pushing for one here at home knows no bounds.It’s now revealed that Tony Blair, now effectively the Remain architect-in-chief, demanded that the body set up to scrutinise the work of former frontline politicians didn’t publish how he earned his cash after he left office.He doesn’t want us to find out, and he certainly doesn’t want us to have any say in the future of the country.He, and those around him, think they know best.But .million people think dferently — and Theresa May owes them every ounce of her strength.YET more evidence that the NHS is in need of desperate reform.An “over-s” AE wing  Bereaved parents being shafted It’s not money that’s the problem.

We are due to leave the EU on March  next year, deal or no deal — and Parliament cannot agree what to do.Some MPs want the PM to go back to Brussels and negotiate something better. Others want to negotiate a dferent deal altogether. Labour wants an election. Die-hard Remainers want another referendum. Many Leavers just want to get out without a deal.And Mrs May insists her deal is the right one, despite knowing it is so unpopular that she couldn’t put it to a vote in the Commons.Whoever gets their way, it is time to strap on our seatbelts and brace ourselves for an almighty crash. However things end, we are heading for multiple constitutional crises that risk smashing our political system to pieces.Yesterday Mrs May promised more assurances from Brussels about her deal’s so-called “backstop”, in which we will be trapped in a customs union with the EU, and Northern Ireland will be trapped inside the single market.But it is completely implausible that she will be able to negotiate an end to the backstop or the right to simply withdraw from it in future.So convinced was the PM that she could not win this argument with Brussels, she did not propose it during the original talks. The Europeans insist they will not make any legally binding commitments about how the backstop might end.So the only effect of delaying the vote is to take up even more time before March . In other words, the game of chicken between ministers and rebel MPs will get more and more high-risk.The time for MPs to prevent a no-deal Brexit will be cut short, the chances of no deal will increase and ministers — because they want to bully Parliament into accepting their deal — will continue to refuse to prepare properly for no deal.And remember what the PM’s deal involves. For nearly two years — but maybe longer — we will pay into the EU budget, accept free movement and respect all European laws.Then, when there is no agreement on the future relationship, we will find ourselves in the backstop. Northern Ireland will effectively be annexed by Brussels. British goods heading for Ulster will be stopped and checked, European goods will be waved through. The EU will decide how other countries can trade with Britain, without our say and regardless of the effects on British jobs. And we will be forced to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice.Our constitution says Parliament is sovereign: Nothing is more powerful than an Act of Parliament, debated and approved by elected representatives.What’s more, no Parliament can “bind its successors”: One generation of MPs cannot dictate what future generations can and cannot decide.Yet the PM’s deal subordinates Parliament to the EU, and does so permanently, with no legal right for Britain to escape its punishing terms. It would leave us as a colony: A country dismembered and incapable of democratic self-government.The remaining options are just as dangerous. Many pro- Europeans want Britain to join the European Economic Area and form a customs union with the EU.Norway Plus, as their plan is now known, would mean Britain accepting even more European laws than the PM proposes, without any say over what they are. For that reason, coupled with the knowledge that it does not avoid the backstop, Norway Plus is even worse than Theresa May’s deal.Yet the “Norwegians” inside the Conservative Party persist. They know there is no majority among Tory MPs for their model but they have a plan.If Mrs May’s deal is rejected and they win a majority for Norway Plus with support from Labour MPs, they can install a caretaker prime minister to deliver it.With a Commons majority for Norway Plus, they believe the Queen would be obliged to appoint their man — David Lidington, perhaps — as PM.The risk to the monarchy of embroiling the Queen in a political controversy of such magnitude seems not to matter to them. One other option, pushed by a handful of Conservatives and many Labour MPs, is to re-run the referendum. Their goal is to remain in the EU after all.The possibility they might lose, the effects on public confidence in our democracy and the instability caused by a narrow remain victory do not matter.For these Europhiles, staying in the EU is more important than the damage they might do to Parliament and to the party system our democracy relies upon.The default option, however,Parliament rejects the PM’s deal, is a no-deal Brexit. That was decided when Parliament passed the Withdrawal Act earlier this year. To override that Act, Parliament must do more than hold a single vote, and the Government must do more than negotiate something .Parliament must amend the Withdrawal Act or pass another Act to set us on a dferent path. If there is any ambiguity, the Supreme Court — whose president, Baroness Hale, has challenged the sovereignty of Parliament in the past — might again play a controversial role.While the Commons is ided, we know a majority of MPs are determined to stop a no-deal Brexit at almost any cost. Some senior Tories say they will vote against the Government in a confidence motion — risking the election of Jeremy Corbyn —it means they can stop leaving without a deal.It is probable we are heading for Norway Plus or another referendum. Whatever happens, the constitutional consequences are likely to be profound.The power of the courts, the party system, Parliamentary sovereignty, the future of the Union, even the monarchy, might come under scrutiny.

This would have starved the country of wealthy investors for months.The latest gaffe follows an ongoing delay to the publication of the Immigration White Paper amid a Cabinet stand-off over post-Brexit controls.And the Home Office is still battling the fallout of the Windrush scandal earlier this year where it emerged Commonwealth nationals living in the UK for years had been wrongly deported and deprived of medical care.The new rules were likely to ask applicants to provide comprehensive audits of their financial and business interests – and proof they had control of £ million of investment funds. It follows a Government review of the visa route as part of a crackdown on money laundering.Some  applications for the ‘golden visas’ came in July alone – up nearly  per cent on a year ago.

It’s a matter for him but nevertheless it’s a challenge and all colleagues need to form their own view of that.”It was the latest outburst in a long-running vein of animosity between Mrs Leadsom, whose role involves organising the order of business in the Commons, and Mr Bercow, who presides over sittings.In May, Mr Bercow hit the headlines after being accused of calling Mrs Leadsom a “stupid woman” and “f****** useless”.Mr Bercow admitted using the word “stupid” amid frustration at the Government when it forced a debate on the Grenfell tragedy to be cut short.But he offered no apology and insisted he would “continue to speak out firmly” for the interests of the Commons.He was not investigated by the parliamentary standards watchdog because he is responsible for ruling on behaviour in the chamber.A spokeswoman for the Speaker declined to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Cabinet Ministers admitted privately a leadership contest now appeared inevitable.Brexiteers who have been baying for Mrs May’s head ever since she agreed her outline deal with Brussels last month said a contest could take place next Monday. The PM will need  votes from Tory MPs to survive. One Tory said: “It could leave us without a Prime Minister over Christmas and New Year. But to be fair we haven’t really had one for some time now.”The putsch came as the PM launched a desperate whistle-stop tour of Europe to try and win fresh concessions on her Brexit deal to help get it through the Commons.

This, alas, is the position the Government and the Prime Minister have now reached.For many people their virtues and vices are cut from the same cloth. Indeed, one may simply be an extension of another. This is what we have seen with Mrs May.Her very steadiness, dutulness and determination have led her to be unable to see that her policy has failed. In her latest House of Commons statement it was once again the mantra that “nothing has changed” — these three small dangerous words that did so much damage to her election campaign were wheeled out again but convinced nobody.After Ministers had taken to the media to insist that the vote on her deal would go ahead there was not one word of apology to them or hint of embarrassment that policy had turned on a sixpence. Continuity, instead, was claimed.At the heart of this humiliation was a dreadful deal that does not represent Brexit. As a London cab driver told me yesterday, he did not vote for a deal. He voted to leave.That widespread sentiment is not honoured in the Withdrawal Agreement, which subjects the United Kingdom to the European Union as a vassal state or colony.Yet the humiliation is even greater for having failed even to allow her deal to be voted on in Parliament. Fearing a huge defeat the Prime Minister is now scurrying around the Continent asking for something she said was impossible a few days ago.Last week this deal was the only one available and the British people were told to like it or lump it.Today, apparently new assurances can be given which will allay our fears. Both positions cannot be true and as EU officials have been arrogantly dismissive of Mrs May’s request it seems that only the airline profit margins will benefit from these trips.However, it could have been so dferent. Had the Prime Minister held the vote and lost by over  votes then she would have had proof to show the European Union that the deal could not pass through Parliament.It would have made it abundantly clear that the Withdrawal Agreement had failed and would have encouraged the EU to take her request for change seriously. Instead the President of the Commission and of the Council have mocked her and almost thrown back in her face the line that “nothing has changed”.Fortunately the UK has a trump card, which is to leave without a deal. In these circumstances we would save £billion of taxpayer’s money and be able to remove all tarfs on goods we do not produce,  helping the least well off.We can immediately cut VAT on domestic fuel, helping the elderly in the winter and remove it from women’s sanitary products where the imposition of tax is an injustice.The Prime Minister has challenged those who want to deliver on the Referendum result to be “honest” about the risks of leaving without a deal, including potential queues at Dover, as there have been in the past when the French go on strike or blockade the roads.There is inevitably a risk that the EU is determined to punish a country that leaves and is willing to break International Treaty obligations.On the other hand there are tangible advantages to be had, too, as Mrs May must herself recognise. Otherwise she ought not to have said “no deal is better than a bad deal”. If she never believed this to be the case then it explains why her negotiating position has been so weak and submissive to the EU. It is the root cause of her failure.This must now be recognised. The Government’s Policy, personally linked to the Prime Minister and the operation at Downing Street, has produced an agreement that fails to deliver Brexit and breaks Theresa May’s own promises.This has lost her the confidence of the House of Commons, for she can no longer push her most important business through, and by all constitutional precedence she ought to resign.Mrs May is a decent person with many honourable characteristics but her handling of Brexit has been hopeless, and has left the country, the Conservative Party and the Government humiliated.As we look to forge an agreement that could set our relations with our nearest neighbours for generations and define the authority of our own democracy, it is time for someone who backs Brexit to take over.Theresa May has failed because she never really wanted to do it. She is now caught in the web that she herself spun, and it is her duty to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are at the beginning of something, not the end.“We’re going to need a lot more than what we have been offered today.”It has emerged that Mrs May is prepared to hold out for up to five weeks and delay the Commons vote until January she has to.The PM had breakfast with Dutch premier Mark Rutte, lunch with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, tea with EU Council President Donald Tusk before a final coffee with EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker.The trip was initially beset by a PR disaster, when Mrs May got locked in the back of her Mercedes limo on arrival at the Chancellery in Berlin.As Mrs Merkel waited on the red carpet and TV cameras looked on, the PM’s embarrassed police bodyguards struggled to free her for  seconds.Putting a brave face on the day, Mrs May said the meetings showed “a shared determination to deal with this issue and address this problem”.She added: “We don’t want the backstop to be used andit is we want to be certain that it’s only temporary”.While offering the PM warm words in public, one after each other EU leaders made it clear that the deal struck three weeks ago could not be reopened.Mr Tusk said his talks with Mrs May had been “long and frank”, adding in a tweet: “Clear that EU wants to help. The question is how”.Angela Merkel brutally shut down attempts to redraw the backstop yesterday, telling the PM at a meeting in Berlin there is “no way to change” the deal.The Chancellor also said she should speak to Brussels, not Member States, and afterwards told her own MPs there won’t be any more Brexit talks.Mr Rutte would only describe his long meeting with Mrs May, at which the two leaders were pictured sitting awkwardly far apart, as a “useful dialogue”.Before Mrs May’s arrival in Berlin, Germany’s European Affairs Minister Michael Roth was even blunter.Mr Roth said: “I hope that they wish each other a Merry Christmas, but there will definitely not be any assurances that we will reopen negotiations.““The negotiators are not in Berlin, they are here in Brussels”.Mr Juncker also insisted there is “no room whatsoever for renegotiation” and only “further clarications and further interpretations” was the PM’s best hope.The PM will hold an even tougher showdown today with Irish PM Leo Varadkar, flying to Dublin tonight after the Cabinet’s weekly meeting.Ahead of it, the Taoiseach infuriated No by issuing a call to the House of Commons to rise up against the PM.He told Irish MPs yesterday that he would “never compromise on the written letter of the backstop”.Mr Varadkar also said he was ready to stare down Mrs May and see Parliament step in as “there’s a majority that the UK should not be plunged into a no-deal”.He added: “It is in their hands at any point in time to take the threat of no-deal off the table either by revoking Article  orthat’s a step too far, by extending it”.At home, a Brexiteer Cabinet minister stepped up the pressure on Mrs May to say that only “legally binding assurances” on the backstop would be acceptable.Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom also insisted a “back to the drawing board” approach was now needed rather than cosmetics.Leading backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Mrs May of “modelling herself on Humpty Dumpty”, adding: “Her words mean ‘just what she chooses to mean - nothing more and nothing less’”.Mr Rees-Mogg told talkRADIO: “The PM goes off to Brussels, gets a nice cup of cocoa and it means nothing.“She will come back with a deal and it will still not pass.”Other Tory MPs said it was time for Britain to strat preparing to walk away without any deal.Former deputy speaker Nigel Evans said: “If there’s not going to be a meeting of minds, the Prime Minister might as well come home and prepare us for leaving on World Trade Organisation rules and the European Union doesn’t get its £ billion.“They need that money. I think the PM should just give her telephone number for Juncker to speed dial her.” The former PM said aof a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic risks reviving tensions behind the deadly Troubles.

including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.The Tory backbencher has said he has no plans to run for the leadership.But hes influential in a potential leadership battle, as head of the powerful European Research Group of Eurosceptic backbenchers.David Davis quit as Brexit secretary on July , , with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposal would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.The ex-Brexit boss has been savage in ripping apart Theresa Mays deal -

A phenomenon you’ll be well aware of,you watch television or engage with Twitter.The Last Leg’s Adam Hills, for instance, is a helluvaguy. So are presenters like Nish Kumar, James O’Brien and all those other blokes who cannot stop wanging on, very publicly, about their feminist credentials and just how much they love the NHS.While others might rely simply on empty words though, Nick Knowles preferred grand heroic gestures, right from day one in the jungle when he threw himself into the water to save four women who were in absolutely no danger of drowning.The idea that Nick Knowles was every woman’s Sir Galahad, was clearly never in doubt then. At least not in his own mind.The ever-so-slightly deluded David Brent-side to his character did not fully emerge, though, until the very last week when James McVey revealed Nick’s version of Make You Feel My Love had gone to number one in the iTunes chart.A stroke of genius for production to let the news slip, obviously, and for someone to send an acoustic guitar into camp, so that Nick could delight everyone with an unplugged rendition, which Emily Atack described as “a viral moment,” much like Ebola.Dec was clearly having the time of his le poking fun at Knowles as well, describing him as: “So good at DIY he’s even gravelled his voice.”I need nearly hardly tell you what happened next then.The public got rid of Nick Knowles, just as they get rid of any jungle contestant who’s ever shown the slightest inclination to act like an entertaining jerk.This is a problem that dates right back to series one, of course, when livewires Uri Geller, Darren Day, Rhona Cameron and Nigel Benn were all voted out before silent Nell McAndrew, and it continues to prevent a genuinely great line-up from turning into a genuinely great series, eventhis one did end with exactly the right winner in Harry Redknapp.I don’t see any way round the problem, either. The voting public just seems to prefer self-absorbed young bores, on “a journey,” to genuine characters.If any of us thought Nick Knowles was finished, the moment Dec read out his name, though, we reckoned without an eviction interview which will surely take its place in I’m A Celeb . . .  folklore.For it turns out Nick Knowles wasn’t in the jungle for purely personal or financial gain.It was to heal a ided nation.“We’re having such a hard time in the UK,” he told Dec, alluding to Brexit, “I thought,we can get on, it might be a bit of a pointer to the nation.”Gee, thanks Nick. I had been wondering why a cane toad was sat on your head, during the Wicked Warehouse task, but it’s beginning to make sense now. He wasn’t finished either.“I’d like to say one last thing.” Go on . ..“Please support veterans, support the police, support the NHS, support the emergency services.They have it a lot harder, on a day to day basis, than we have it in here.”A hell-of-a-claim to make when you’ve reportedly just been paid £, to sit around a television set, in Australia, with John Barrowman, but then Nick Knowles is clearly a helluvaguy.SO there was Gemma Collins behaving like a monstrous old boot as usual, last week, when fellow BBC diner Adrian Chiles silenced her with a simple question.“Is there anything you can’t stop eating ”At which point you could see Gemma disengaging from the conversation as she ran through the checklist: “Cakes, buns, crisps, Pringles, biscuits, pies, potatoes, cows, pigs, horses, breeze blocks, deep-fried landfill, light aircraft . . . ”The silence couldn’t last forever, obviously, but it was a nice  seconds on BBC’s I’ll Get This, a celeb dinner party show, that I hadn’t really seen the point of up until the arrival of Chiles, who has a streak of honesty that’s very rare among presenters.Even by Adrian’s own standards, though, his response to the question “Why would you make the best chat show host ” was brutally self-aware.“For a huge amount of money, a big hullabaloo, billboards everywhere, I went to ITV and did another chat show, Daybreak, at which I was s**t.“I failed abysmally, humiliatingly. I looked miserable, I was sullen, I sat there like a bag of potatoes, I dragged everyone down with me, from the moment I walked in the door at am.“SoI ever get the chance to host another chat show, let’s be honest, unlikely, I will be the best chat show host ever, ’cos I know what it’s like to succeed and I know what it’s like to fail, dismally.”A confession that I expected to be met with stunned silence but it was actually greeted by spontaneous applause, from fellow celebs, and a faint whirring noise from Gemma Collins’ brain: “Doritos, kebabs, dips, mini eclairs, maxi eclairs, Jenny Eclairs . . . ”I PARTED company with Celebrity Antiques Road Trip the moment the commentator announced: “Russell Kane’s heading for an auction at Penkridge.”Anyone know how much he fetched UK’S Strongest Man. Best dead-weight lt was, of course, won by Declan Donnelly . . .  who carried about  kilos for three weeks.FRANCE is burning, Paris is in lockdown and its government’s on the brink.So how many mentions do you think TV’s fearlessly impartial satirical news shows, Have I Got News For You, The Mash Report and The Last Leg, gave it, on Friday Correct. None. Because these inconvenient facts don’t fit the narrative and agenda of the BBC and Channel , which believe Britain is a basket case and Europe is our only salvation.So it was simply ignored and all three proceeded with the same lazy and witless anti-Brexit and Trump routines they go with every week.There were some slight iations with the other material, obviously.The Last Leg and HIGNFY, ably hosted by Danny Dyer, both invited lists to be outraged by alleged sexism at the Ballon D’Or awards, held in Paris, ironically.While the final Mash Report of the series offered Rachel Parris lecturing viewers about poverty, as only a privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate truly can, before smug-bucket in chief Nish Kumar closed the show by saying: “We’ll be back next year,the will of the people demands it.”Which is almost the very last thing the will of the people will ever demand.The Mash Report will be back, though. The political agenda of the BBC demands it.Who said the following last week: “Oh my God, there’s a cockroach having dinner on my butthole.”A John Barrowman doing the Rotten Retrieval trial on I’m a Celebrity B Tyson Fury during his Good Morning Britain interview with Piers Morgan Sent in by Connor David.

David Davis and Dominic Raab were last-minute additions to the launch of “A Better Deal” - an alternative manesto for leaving the EU. Mr Davis said Britain needed to reset its Brexit negotiating strategy, adding “we haven’t got time to waste”. He said the next step in approving such a plan would be to present a new, legal text to the EU. And speaking just hours before a crunch confidence vote in Theresa May’s leadership, Mr Davis said he would cast his ballot “in the national interest”.  The document, drawn up by a former adviser to Liam Fox, Shanker Singham, customs expert Hans Maessen and lawyer Robert MacLean, proposed:No single customs territory between the UK and the EU, allowing Britain to regain control over tarfs and regulations and negotiate trade agreements with other countries A -year, extendable backstop featuring advanced customs facilitation measures to keep the Irish border open, a zero-tarf free trade agreement in goods and a commitment by all parties not to place infrastructure on the border Mutual recognition of regulations, with measures to ensure that the animal health and disease control zone on the island of Ireland can be maintained Level playing field provisions on labour, the environment, competition and state aid. The removal of geographic indications provisions from the Withdrawal Agreement, to be considered as part of a later free trade deal The removal of language on World Trade Organisation collaboration, ensuring that the UK can operate independently in the WTO.Launching the paper, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said: There are modest and reasonable changes that could help salvage the proposed deal with the EU. The UK needs a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop, but we can give the Irish Government assurances that we would put in place specic measures to guarantee noto a hard border. This proposal can help deliver this and allay fears that the UK would be stuck indefinitely in an undemocratic regime of laws we have no control over and cant exit.  The backstop aims to ensure there is no hard land border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, which is an EU member. But some fear the backstop will leave Britain subject indefinitely to EU rules, long after the country has given up a say in drafting them.

The Labour leader barely mentioned tonights no confidence vote in her leadership - saying only it was utterly irrelevant to the lives of people across our country. Instead he blasted her contempt of MPs and the public in refusing to set a date for a vote on her Brexit deal. Mr Corbyn demanded she guarantee a vote on the deal - which she is trying to renegotiate with the EU - in the next week. But to roars of Tory supporters, a confident Mrs May - watched by her husband in the Commons - said the date will be announced in the usual way.  She smirked: Weve had a meaningful vote. We had it in the referendum of . If he wants a meaningful date Ill give him one -  March ! That prompted the Labour leader to explode with anger. He roared that her behaviour was totally absolutely unacceptable.  Her behaviour today is just contemptuous of this Parliament and of this process, he said. As the Prime Minister took to the despatch box her husband looked on from the gallery.  Philip May sat with his arms folded watching his we face one of the most gruelling PMQs of her career. Mrs May opened with a joke about her leadership crisis, saying she would have meetings - possibly many meetings - with ministers, a rf on the usual opening at PMQs.  Tory benches were ided with half of MPs sitting in stony silence while the other half roared on with approval for the PM. But Mrs May gave a surprisingly confident performance buoyed by the loudly supportive MPs on her own side. She claimed Jeremy Corbyn couldnt care less what I bring back from Brussels.  Hes been clear whatever comes back from Brussels hes going to vote against it, she said. All he wants to do is create chaos in our economy, damage, ision in our society, and damage our economy. Thats Labour, thats Corbyn. She also mocked Labour frontbencher Barry Gardiner for, she claimed, muddling Labours Brexit plan. Mr Corbyn scowled as she said: He sent out his henchman to reveal it all to the world - the inconstant Gardiner!  But SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: This government is an embarrassment. The Labour leader hit back: The PMs appalling behaviour needs to be held to account by this house. The people of this country are more and more concerned about the ongoing chaos at the centre of her government. He said it was clear nothing has changed - quoting the PMs worst moment of her election campaign last year. He added: The time for dithering and delay is over.

Asked to give an “absolute, categorical promise” that he would not stand against the PM, Mr Johnson said: “I will give you an absolute, categorical promise that I will continue to advocate what I think is the most sensible plan.” Rees-Mogg preparing to go out round the country and campaign for Boris. Dominic Raab    Don’t be embarrassedthe name leaves you scratching your head. Mr Raab was Brexit Secretary for about five minutes but quit over the Prime Minister’s deal. He is very much on the right of the Tory party, called for us to leave the EU years before the referendum. He is understood to have offended Theresa May with a  online article in which he attacked the “equality bandwagon” and said that men were getting “a raw deal” which may have slowed his progress up the ministerial ladder. He is known to order the same lunch every day from sandwich shop Pret a manger. His preferred combo of the chicken Caesar and bacon baguette, SuperFruit pot and Vitamin Volcano smoothie quickly became known as the Raab special. The former Brexit Secretary said there were moments the UK could have “pressed harder” on the backstop. Asked about the leadership on Sunday, he said: “I’ve always said I wouldn’t rule it out” but “it would be very self-indulgent to be engaging in all that speculation when we’ve got such a big issue up for decision on Tuesday”. Sajid Javid    The Home Secretary is understood to have told Cabinet colleagues he is gearing up for a bid. It’s widely expected the next Tory leader will be a Brexiteer mean Mr Javid, who backed Reman but now supports Leave, would have a real fight on his hands to win round Tory members. He took over at the Home Office after Amber Rudd was forced to quit over the Windrush scandal and has since been seen as a safe pair of hands. Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani bus driver, would be the first non-white Prime Minister. Michael Gove    Boris Johnson’s partner in crime on the Leave campaign displayed a ruthless streak when he shafted his friend during the last leadership campaign. The Environment Secretary has managed to take one of the government’s less exciting briefs and made a name for himself after banning plastic straws and increasing the price of plastic bags. Mr Gove said on Monday morning it was “extremely unlikely” that he would stand as a future Conservative Party leader which is definitely not ruling out a bid. Jeremy Hunt    Mr Hunt is seen as a safe pair of hands after showing he could weather controversy as the longest serving Health Secretary in the history of the NHS. As Foreign Secretary he has had success in helping free British academic Matthew Hedges from prison in the United Arab Emirates.  But Mr Hunt, who campaigned for Remain but accepted the result of the referendum, may have a hard job trying to win over hardcore Brexiteers in the party. Jacob Rees-Mogg    The Tory Brexiteer has been one of Theresa Mays leading critics. He put in a vote of no confidence saying her Brexit deal would trap the UK in vassalage, powerless under EU rules. Hes insisted hes not standing for leadership in the past and backed people like Boris Johnson. But whats a political promise, eh  Penny Mordaunt    The Royal Navy reservist who is currently the International Development Secretary would appeal to right-wingers with her plans to cut back on sending aid to wealthier countries. Ms Mordaunt took part in a reality TV show splash and showed she had a sense of humour after using the word “cock” six times in a parliamentary debate as a forfeit issued during a dinner in the officers’ mess. The Brexit-supporting minister has been clear that she does not back the Prime Minister’s deal but has stayed loyal to Theresa May. She criticised attempts by Jacob Rees-Mogg and other Tory backbenchers to unseat the Prime Minister, saying: “That was not helpful.” David Davis    Former Brexit Secretary David Davis resigned from the Cabinet over the Brexit deal back before it was cool. In the week of the no confidence vote he gave a very heartfelt speech that was interpreted as a leadership pitch. Amber Rudd    Amber Rudd has gone from one tricky department to another. She was forced to quit as Home Secretary during the Windrush scandal. But after eurosceptic Esther McVey quit the government, remain-supporting Ms Rudd ed to government. In an interview at the weekend she criticised male Brexiteers who “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done. She has also suggested a plan B for Brexit could see the UK in a Norway plus arrangement. Ms Rudd, who is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party, has said she hoped the Tories choose a “centrist” figure for its next leader. David Lidington    The PMs de facto deputy is fiercely loyal and shows no sign of wanting to run. But the odds are in his favour due to his reliability and seniority. Hes a Remainer. Esther McVey    The former Work and Pensions Secretary made a clear pitch to take the top job when quizzed. She said she would give the prospect of standing as leader “serious concern” and suggested that Brexiteers should unite around a single candidate. The ardent Brexiteer quit the cabinet earlier this month saying that the PM’s deal was a breach of trust with voters and that Mrs May shouldto Brussels to get a better deal. She wants an end to the Irish backstop and is convinced it is unnecessary. She said: “The EU says it doesn’t want it, we don’t want it so why is it there  Remove it.” She became a hate figure for the left because of her role in bringing in the bedroom tax. Another ardent right-winger. Andrea Leadsom    The Brexiteer Leader of the Commons says shes loyal to the PM but makes no secret of her ambiitions. She was Mrs Mays leadership rival in  before dropping out in a storm over comments she made about motherhood.Geoffrey Cox    The attorney general seems a very, very unlikely pick but he enthralled the Tory grassroots with a Mufasa-voiced speech at the  party conference.

But yeah, hell with it, why not boot her out because she cant make you a unicorn Theresa May shows as much emotion as a pencil sharpener, and has achieved not one thing of value in Downing Street. But with their extended stabbing spree, the Tory fundamentalists have made her a nationally-sympathetic figure who appears to be made of tungsten carbide.Yet they have no alternative leader, no better Brexit plan, and no Earthly chance of a unicorn suddenly manesting to resolve the insoluble Northern Ireland problem.But that doesnt mean the backbenchers dont have a really good reason for muddying the waters with failed coups, leadership battles and votes of no confidence.Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson, Andrea Jenkyns and all the rest of the wingnuts really, REALLY, need Brexit to fail.For  years the Tories have used the EU as a bogeyman and now, confronted with having to accept responsibility for the first time, they are turning on each other like theyre in the crack cocaine version of Lord of the Flies.They campaigned for a Brexit that was never possible. They promised things that were never deliverable. Andwe Brexit, under any kind of deal, all problems Brexit-related or otherwise will be laid at their doors.  Doom is looming up at them with all the grim inevitability of an unpatched pothole a mile deep. Thats why theyre eating themselves from the toes up - its the only way they can think of to get away from it. And remember, this isnt even the deal theyre arguing over - merely the holding pattern the country adopts while entering proper trade talks. The way theyre going, the Brexit monkeys will have chewed their ears off before we actually put pen to paper in perhaps another decades time. Their first thought was to blame the EU, because theyre used to that. So this was Frau Merkels fault, we were being punished, nanny was mean. When that didnt work they blamed the Celts. Sturgeon is exploiting the situation, Varadkar is holding us hostage, its inconceivable the .m British citizens in Northern Ireland should matter.Then they clutched at straws - lets get drug smugglers to do online customs forms, lets fall back on World Trade Organisation rules, surely technology can save us. At every stage they ignored reality. That massive technology projects take decades, cost billions, and never work that the WTO still requires  years of tarf talks and a hard border and that a union of  countries was always going to be stronger than a less-than-united UK.  The wingnuts also ignored two little things called Parliamentary sovereignty and democracy, which combined mean they would need widespread support they dont have to abandon Theresas plan.They cannot get No Deal through Parliament, or past the country. They cannot accept whats on the table, but they have nothing better to replace it.Meanwhile the pound has noseed, the economy is stuttering, the NHS is on its knees, and were an international laughing-stock. Nothing  is being done while the government is stuck on Brexit, and Brexit is no nearer. The lunatics are in a minority, and irrelevance yawns before them. Which leaves the extremists only one option. Make Theresa safe, so they can carry on blaming her, blaming the EU, and making their own contribution to the kne crime statistics. Its taken the plotters a year to get  letters of no confidence. They have as much chance of getting the  votes needed to oust the PM by pm tonight as I do of being called up as a last-minute finalist for Strictly Come Dancing.If they did win the vote - and this time Russian Facebook trolls will be of little help - there is no prospective successor, and no chance of installing one more than a week before the Parliamentary deadline for a Brexit agreement of January .Which means that,successful, the most furious pro-Brexit nutcases will have managed only to delay it, worsen it, and possibly put it off for another general election as well. At best, theyll have  days to get the EU, Parliament and the country to agree when we havent been able to agree on anything since .Andthey lose, they will have strengthened Theresas position and protected her from further leadership challenges for a year. Now, for this to be a strategy on their part it means the fundamentalists have to be sane enough to think of it, and clever enough to do it. And lets face it, a sugar-crazed troupe of rabid monkeys flinging poop at each other are more calm and collected than the Tory backbenches.But this is where their madness has led them: into a series of actions which can only make Theresa stronger, Brexit more moderate, and Britain more laughable. Its the Tory backbenchers who are the real wreckers. Theyre the ones ignoring democracy, demanding votes for themselves on issues theyve already voted on, while denying a second vote to others. Theyre the traitors, and Jeremy Corbyn is presumably very grateful to them.This never-ending Tory psychodrama does not help anyone. It solves nothing for the NHS, finds no extra money for schools or housing, grants us no allies and finds no solutions.Its all very dramatic and interesting, and the countrys getting a solid education in how Parliament works. But the Tories are also giving a masterclass in how to fail at everything they touch. When even an unfunny comedian is able to do what he sets out to more competently than a politician, its time for drastic change.

Kelly Reynolds, , said her son, Harry Kirkby, couldnt get into the same school as his sister and its too dficult to walk them to and from separate schools about a mile apart. The mum-of-four, from Reigate, Surrey, said she doesnt drive and she needs the county councils help taking her son to school. He was denied free transport because the school that offered him a spot is within walking distance, and Ms Reynolds has accused the council of failing her children, Surrey Live reports.   Her daughter Lily, eight, was offered a place at Wray Common Primary School after the family moved to Reigate in August but there was not enough space for Harry. He was offered a place at Holmesdale Community Infant School. Ms Reynolds, who also has a two-year-old and a one-year-old, said that without the council providing transport for Harry, she cannot easily make the -minute journey to Wray Common with Lily then the -minute walk to Holmesdale with her other two children in tow, twice a day. The council says she is not eligible for free transport because Harrys offered school is within walking distance but she claims the council has not taken her full circumstances into account.   She said: I had to make the terrible decision about what child of mine should go to school as the council arent willing to provide transportation for Harry to get to Holmesdale. Lily is now making friends, having them round for dinner and joining clubs but Harry is completely missing out on that. They have completely and utterly failed my children. The family moved to the area in January after Ms Reynolds was forced to declare them homeless. She stayed temporarily with a family member in Earlswood, at which time Harry was able to attend school. He was at Salfords Primary until July when he broke up for the summer. But after being offered temporary accommodation in Reigate in August - something she had to accept in order to be eligible for permanent council housing - Ms Reynolds had to apply for new schools for the children.  Due to the pressure on school places locally, she was unable to get them into the same school. Ms Reynolds said: The council keep telling me to appeal the decision but then also keep saying I am not going to win the appeal asis in walking distance. I have done everything. While living in Earlswood, she had made the -minute walk to Salfords Primary, which she said was dficult with all four children in tow, but because Harry and Lily were at the same school, it was possible. Ms Reynolds called social services to ask for help after her request for transport was rejected. She said: They told me I have to find someone to take him to school. They want me to let my son go off with someone I dont know who I am supposed to just ask to take him in. I was also told I have to send him to after-school clubsbut they cost pound a month. Im a single mother with four children that is completely unreasonable. I dont know what  to do. A Surrey County Council spokesman said: We follow national guidance when deciding home-to-school transport requests – in this instance we offered the parent a place at Holmesdale School for her son after they moved to the area but she didnt respond. Were supporting her to seewe can get her children into the same schoolbut this is only possiblea space becomes available. Weve also advised her of the transport appeal process.

Meghan wore a chic black dress and had her hair scraped into her signature bun as she cradled her blossoming baby bump on stage.

As Naseem is appealing a decision by Stoke-on-Trents City Council to grant planning permission in retrospect allowing his home to remain standing. Mr Naseem said he received permission for the property in  but a failure to dig the foundations deep enough has resulted in the roof ridge being cmhigher than expected, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.Previously the council had deferred making a decision for six months to seea compromise could be reached.Mr Naseem came back to the authority with another retrospective planning application and a proposal which would see the height of a central glazed gable reduced by .m and the removal of two dormer windows within the roof slope and their replacement with roof lights. Homes at park site owned by gipsy king Alfie Best face being bulldozed and residents kicked outBut the latest application was rejected by the council this month and now the family-of-seven could see their home bulldozed.Mr Naseem said: “A lot of people think there was no planning permission for this house to be built, whereas we had full permission for it. They are saying the third storey shouldn’t be there. “That’s  – the house was built exactly as it should be. The dormer windows on the third floor have always been in the plans. “The only problem the house has got is it is ft in taller than it should be – that’s to do with the foundations.” Mr Naseem added that a planning enforcement officer had visited the site during construction in  and the city council had the opportunity then to halt further workneeded. “If I was doing something wrong she should have stopped the work. But she did nothing like that,” he said. “She told me to put in a retrospective planning application and now this minor thing has become a huge thing. “I’m not happy with the city council. This issue is their making.   “There is a house in Trentham that is higher compared to the next door property but they didn’t refuse that. If they have got such a problem with my house why are they giving planning permission to that one  “If there is a rule for one it should be there for the other – it’s not fair on the other person.” Mr Naseem previously said he had spent pound, on the building project since plans for the development were approved in . He claims it would cost pound, – money he does not have – to lower the roof. Case officer Karen Kent recommended refusal of the latest application, saying the alterations did not address the problems with the application. In her report she wrote: “The submissions follow the refusal of two applications for the retention of the dwelling as constructed and the subsequent authorised enforcement action for its demolition. “Both applications have been assessed within the following report as although the procedural nature of both dfers, the principal planning issues raised by the applications are the same. “The applications have been considered against all material planning considerations and both are recommended for refusal.” This was backed by councillors who said planning rules must be enforced.   Councillor Ross Irving said: “The main problem with this seems to stem from lack of excavation at original conception, it threw the whole thing off kilter and that’s why we’re here today. Why wasn’t it excavated to the required level  “We have a duty of care to make sure residents can live their lives without this impacting them. “We have discussed this for months and months, we have to grasp the nettle. It’s up to the owner to come forward, I know it’s expensive but its up to the owner to resolve the issue.” This was backed up by councillor Janine Bridges who said: “I have got sympathy with the applicant. “We’re bound by the laws of the land,we don’t follow them there would be anarchy.” Councillor Andy Platt said he didn’t want to see the property flattened and hoped a compromise could still be reached.

Dr Andrea McFarlane, , accepted pound a month from patient, leaving the the -year-old with just pound, in her bank account, Lincolnshire Live reported. It was heard that McFarlane - a senior partner at the Crown House Surgery in Retford, Nottinghamshire - used the money to pay for household repairs, a birthday present to herself, and servicing and petrol for her car. McFarlane nurtured an inappropriate friendship withe the patient during a six year period between April  and January  and wrote numerous thank-you letters to her.   One read: Thank you also for all the other goodies and help towards all that le needs sorting. My new tyres, my new locks, fixing my computer, the car service, the gutters needed fixing, the electrician needed to fix lights, the petrol to rugby matches, and so much more. You will never know how much help you have given me. My darling angel, you give me more than I can imagine. As for my birthday I do know of a beautul thing I have wanted for many years, a silver bracelet. I promise to get that from you, when you see it you will agree it is quite special. The full extent of the pairs friendship emerged in  when the patient suffered a stroke and was moved into a care home. Her nephew, who was cleaning his aunts home, found dozens of thank you cards and letters from Dr McFarlane on the old womans mantlepiece and discovered payments of up to pound, had been made by the patient to the GP. An inquiry by the General Medical Council later claimed McFarlane had also encouraged the patient to switch doctors so the authorities would not find out about their friendship, it was said. The unnamed pensioner - known only as Patient A - was found to have just pound, left in her bank account. At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, Jeremy Lasker, lawyer for the GMC said: The GMC do not suggest Dr McFarlane intended from the outset to embark upon an improper relationship with the elderly and vulnerable patient, but there can be little doubt that an improper relationship did in fact develop. It was a relationship in which professional and personal boundaries between doctor and patient became increasingly and inappropriately blurred.  Dr McFarlane appears to have nurtured the relationship and to take full advantage in terms of the financial benefit to her.As the relationship with Patient A developed, it placed her in a situation where there arose signicant conflicts of interest. The attempt by Dr McFarlane to put distance between her and the patient was her attempt to allow the relationship to continue as it did before. The hearing was told McFarlane first met the patient in  when she aged .Mr Lasker added: The doctor has formally admitted that at all times Patient A was vulnerable. In September , Patient A was widowed. In June  she suffered a severe stroke and she was admitted to a care home where she has remained unable to resume independent living. She had no children, following her stroke her house and other personal effects were being wound up by her nephew. He had then no real knowledge of the relationship which existed. As her nephew began to sort through the personal belongings of his aunt he came across a letter, indicating that around  a large investment had matured. He began to make enquiries with Patient As bank. The bank showed two cheques which were related to these funds. In total they amount to pound, and Dr McFarlane was recorded as being the recipient of these funds. Her nephew then began to discover a considerable amount of correspondence written to Patient A from Dr McFarlane. Those that do have dates cover a period between April  and December . Many of the letters and cards express thanks and gratitude and disbelief at the kindness and generosity of Patient A. Some letters make reference to nature of gts received, not always money.   The GMC suggest that when all of these are taken together they demonstrate the overwhelming generosity of Patient A and the fact that Dr McFarlane was more than happy to benefit from her generosity. There have been regular monthly debits of pound. There were  debits over an  month period.  debit entries which amount to pound, are not admitted by the doctor. But in total, she has admitted receipt of pound, in cash together with other gts. The hearing was told in one of her thank you letters, McFarlane disclosed private information about another patient who was terminally ill with cancer. She wrote: She survived for so long and how she fought against it for long is truly amazing. In another letter to the patient, McFarlane suggested that she change her regular GP to someone  from the practice as the GMC are very strict about doctors taking advantage of a patient. The note read: You mentioned, would it be betteryou changed doctor  Yes of course it would, as a doctor should not have a close relationship with a patient. We need to be careful as people may not understand our close friendship, I have grown to love you as my friend which has nothing to do with me being your doctor. The governing bodies such as the GMC are very strict about these things as a patient should be protected from a doctor taking advantage. An excellent solution which would allow me to make sure you get the very best treatment and would not cause this professional dilemma, would beyou changed your doctor to one of my colleagues. If anyone asked you why you changed, you could say that it was because I have gone part-time and that my waiting times are now longer. Later McFarlane emailed her colleague to suggest that the patient wanted to change her regular GP.She wrote: This delightful lady requests to have you as her usual doctor as the wait time with my reduced hours are too long. Hope it is ok that I have changed her to you. Patient As nephew told the hearing: I was aware that my auntie had a close relationship with the doctor. Sometimes during family visits there would be cards on the mantelpiece from the doctor. There were one or two photos with the doctor in. I never visited my auntie on an occasion when the doctor was there. I never knew my aunt was giving gts of any sort. I found out when I was clearing up her house. I first knew from the cheques that were left. As I went through the process of clearing the house, I found more and more letters and cards. There was very little evidence of my aunt investing any kind of money in her own house. Her and my uncle were not known to splash out. My understanding was that when she was no longer able to drive, she gave her car to Dr McFarlanes sister.   I wanted to try and get an understanding as to the amount of money which had gone out of her account over the years. My initial complaint was firstly about the two large cheques. The gathering of all of this probably took me a few months. It only came to light that Dr McFarlane was a friend around . I was not aware that she had any other special friends. My aunt was pretty much housebound. Before she had her stroke, her bank account was down to pound,. Patient As housekeeper Jane Heath said: When I first started working for her, she was very fit for her age and very independent. She was in her early s and she and her husband led a simple le. I knew Dr McFarlane but I didnt have a lot of contact with her, we met on a couple of occasions at her house. The visits were social. A year before she went into the home her health deteriorated. She was a very private person, she did say she missed her husband but never went into detail. I ran some errands for her, I paid for newspapers for her, did her shopping and got anything she needed. I would go to the bank to collect any money that she needed. She would give an old-fashioned cheque. The money would be about pound or pound. She had told me about a three diamond ring she had given to the doctor. I did ask hershed told her family. McFarlane initially claimed some of the money she received came from her ex-husband as part of her orce settlement but she subsequently admitted accepting money from the patient. She denies disclosure of confidential information about other patients and refutes claims she received gts because of her influence on the patient. The hearing continues.

Spotting how nice it looked on the model, Lucy Anderson-Roberts, , bought the pound black top with slits at the bottom to wear with some high waisted trousers. But Lucy was less than impressed when she tried the top on and saw it left her breasts exposed and nipples poking through the slits. Lucy, from Bath, Somerset, said: “I saw it in the sale a while ago and thought it would go great with a pair of high waisted trousers I have. “Before I’d put it on I noticed that it wasn’t quite right. The gaps weren’t in the right place. I thought there was no way that’s going to fall below my boob.   “I tried it on anyway and took a photo to send to my boyfriend.

Although the sweet snaps of the Duchess have captivated fans, theres been an outpouring of criticism from trolls on social media because she held her bump for so long. One wrote on Twitter: #Meghan. We know you are pregnant. You can stop holding onto the bump with both hands now. It won’t fall off. Another said: Meghan Markle needs to desperately stop holding her baby bump because it’s not aseveryone doesn’t already know.     If I see one more photo of Meghan Markle cradling that bump I am going to vomit. I swear she and Beyonceacute think they are the only women in the world to get pregnant. You are pregnant......WE KNOW!, a third said. Theres a deluge of mean-spirited comments on Instagram and Facebook too. Despite so many trolls slamming the Duchess for her motherly behaviour, plenty of people rushed to her defence. One said on Twitter: Dont even waste ur time arguing with ppl attacking Meghan for something as normal and precious as cradling her bump. The fact that theyre even attacking her in the first place tells you theyre a lost cause so.    Another agreed: People are really mad that Meghan Markle was holding her bump in a photo  Wow. A third said: why does Meghan holding her baby bump bother so much people  why do you care  youd think it was a crime thats shes touching HER baby bump. shes so warm and attentive all the time, its obvious shed be that way with a growing baby inside of her.

Snow is expected over the Grampians in Scotland and North York Moors in England, with the heaviest amounts predicted for the weekend in parts of Scotland. Bitter winds from Siberia will make the chilly weather feel even colder in the east, while gales will batter western areas in Scotland. Wednesday will get off to a frosty and foggy start in many places and the day will become increasingly windy with patchy rain across Northern Ireland, central and western Scotland, Wales and south-west England, the Met Office says.  Elsewhere, it will be mostly dry and increasingly sunny. Meteorologist Aidan McGivern has warned of mph wind gusts around coasts and hills, telling people in those areas to watch out. He told the Express: “Because of the clearest skies and the lightest breeze will be in the east. “Here, temperatures will drop to - or - degrees before coming up a little bit by dawn.  “So a chilly start for eastern parts of England, eastern Scotland, some sheltered spots of central Britain but plenty of sunshine in the colder spots and that sunshine becomes more widespread through the day.” On Wednesday night, it will stay cloudy and windy across Northern Ireland and the south-west corner of Britain, with occasional rain. The Met Office is expecting a few showers in the east and northeast. Clear spells and a frost are forecast where.  Thursday will be a cold one for much of the country, with rain and strong winds easing across Northern Ireland, and west Devon and Cornwall in England. Some showers are expected near North Sea coasts. Friday will be cold with an early frost and showers in the north-east before wet and windy weather moves east on Saturday, with snow in the north and east. Sunday is expected to be brighter, showery and less cold, the Met Office said. Meanwhile, there are warnings that Britain could face a brutal polar blast this winter, with similar conditions that the country saw in February when it was hit by Arctic air from Siberia and heavy snow that caused travel chaos. Met Office five-day forecast Wednesday Wednesday will be rather cloudy and increasingly windy, with patchy rain, across Northern Ireland, central and western Scotland, along with Wales and southwest England. Elsewhere it will be mostly dry and increasingly sunny, after a locally frosty and foggy start. Wednesday night Cloudy and windy overnight across Northern Ireland, and the southwest corner of Britain, with occasional rain. A few showers in the east and northeast.

Children as young as  have been arrested for selling the zombie drug, often to homeless addicts. A Mirror investigation found the Spice epidemic sweeping Britain has reached terrying levels. It comes as Prince William spoke out against the drug as he visited a homeless shelter yesterday. Cynical gang bosses are making thousands of pounds a year by using youngsters to peddle their misery since the former legal high was criminalised in . Ex-addict Phillip Hartley has been trying to highlight the shynightmare of Spice, which leaves users in a trance-like state, in his home town of Doncaster, South Yorks.   The -year-old, who works with the homeless, told how he sees shychildren running the drug frequently. Phillip said: “I see it every day, these kids flying around on their pushbikes going from beggar to beggar with Spice. They’re being groomed into thinking the big, hard-man le is cool. I’m trying to make my town safe for my three kids and teach these kids it’s cool to care and be compassionate. Spice is an epidemic in this country.” The -year-old arrested was held in London last year, according to a Freedom of Information request. The youngest held in shyLeicestershire was  and in Greater Manchester . The Children’s Society has also seen a rise in the number of children dealing drugs. Greater Manchester area manager Joanna Hunt said dealers target vulnerable youngsters who have often suffered trauma. She added: “Younger and younger children being exploited. “Earlier this year there was a nine-year-old boy dealing in cannabis five minutes from his school. “Perpetrators are clever at getting into the heads of young people. They will identy the trauma they have been through and manipulate it. “They are vulnerable. If they are being told we can make your le better, they are going to take it. “Some perpetrators target the shyfamilies, buying essentials that some families simply can’t afford, such as washing machines and sofas.” Manchester politan shyUniversity criminologist Dr Rob Ralphs said: “The most at risk are young people in care. Young people don’t face the same sanctions, they are less likely to be jailed so are more likely to take risks in a street market.”  Prince William spoke about Spice on a trip with Kate to a Central London hostel run by homeless charity The Passage. He said: “The fact it was a legal high and it has led to such shyaddiction is just terrible.” Mick Clarke, chief executive of The Passage, added: “There was real empathy that came from the duke and duchess. I think they shyappreciated hearing first-hand the terrible effects of Spice. I think they were shocked.” Dr Ralphs said the Spice epidemic started in prisons and has now spilled onto the streets. In a study behind bars he found the smoking ban in jails has fuelled the problem as inmates have turned to the cheap drug after the black market price of tobacco rocketed to pound a pouch. Spice, bought for as little as pound, is sprayed on anything from letters to drawings and smuggled inside. Dr Ralphs added: “You’ve got people who would have been smoking rollies now smoking Spice.”A -year-old former inmate who tried the drug for the first time at  in jail said: “It’s really bad in prison. I reckon % are on it.” The Prison Service insisted it was trying to tackle the problem with extra funds. Last week, the first national conference on the Spice epidemic was held in Sheffield, South Yorks. Last year, the drug shyreportedly led to  deaths.

While Camp Gilot, the HQ of an Israeli Intelligence Corps unit, has been clearly visible on Google Maps for some time, it was obscured on Yandex, the Russian rival. Yandex Maps obscured the locations of  sites – some of them top secret nuclear facilities – in Israel and Turkey, according to a damning report by the Federation of American Scientists . But now their exact locations have been revealed as a result of the gaffe, because the blurring has the opposite of the desired effect by drawing attention to them. Nuclear storage bases and surface-to-air missile sites are among those buildings revealed. Two NATO facilities - Allied Land Commandin Izmir, and Incirlik Air Base, which hosts US B nuclear gravity bombs - were obscured, the report adds.  Others include signicant airfields, ports, bunkers and barracks. FAS Matt Korda, an intelligence analyst, wrote: “This blurring is almost certainly the result of requests from both Israel and Turkey it seems highly unlikely that a Russian company would undertake such a time-consuming task of its own volition. “Fortunately, this has had the unintended effect of revealing the location and exact perimeter of every signicant military facility within both countries,one is curious enough to st through the entire map looking for blurry patches. “By complying with requests to selectively obscure military facilities, the mapping service has actually revealed their precise locations, perimeters, and potentialto anyone curious enough to find them all.” Camp Glilot, north of Tel Aviv, the home of Unit , the signal intelligence and code deciphering arm of the Israeli Defence Forces is also one of the sites highlighted. It is believed to intercept communications from across Africa and the Middle East.  A Yandex spokesman said: “Local regulations sometimes require the blurring of certain locations of satellite imagery or the removal of other such information to protect sensitive information. “In countries where we are developing our services, such as Turkey and Israel, we are especially careful to update the maps and meet the requirements of local regulations.  “In the cases of Israel and Turkey, our product complies with all regulations and requests of the authorities. “Certain locations in satellite images are blurred so that it is impossible to clearly see them. “Our mapping product in Israel conforms to the national public map published by the government of Israel as it pertains to the blurring of military assets and locations. “Our Turkish map product observes local rules and regulations similarly.” "},{"url":null,"title":"towns streets become paved chocolate","story":"NewsTowns streets become paved in CHOCOLATE after massive leak at factoryIt took rescue teams nearly  hours to clear up the spillage at the DreiMeister chocolate factory in Westönnen, GermanyShareCommentsByToby Meyjes:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsThe one-tonne leak of chocolate covered the pavements of Westönnen in Germany \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt wasnt quite Quality Street but a towns pavements became paved with chocolate after after a huge leak at a factory.

Festive flippancy aside, there is, of course, reason to believe the slide in results presided over by Csaba will not be repeated this time round.Under the new boss, the Tangerines have looked better organised and with a clearer game plan than they’ve probably had since the early days of Jackie McNamara’s time in charge, or certainly since Ray McKinnon’s first term in charge.Their style under this gaffer, by no means just blood and thunder, is more robust and therefore better suited to the physical rigours of Scotland’s second tier.On top of that, and in part it should be said because of Csaba’s ability to identy decent talent, there can be little argument this season’s squad contains better overall quality.In striker Pavol Safranko they have a front man of the calibre many teams even at top-flight level must be anxious off.And wide man Fraser Aird has been another astute signing who, like Safranko, has really come into his own under the current boss.There is also reason to believe his past, successful, experience of Championship football when he raced to promotion at Hearts means that come next month’s transfer window, Robbie will get exactly what he needs to strengthen the weaker areas of his team.The impressive form of Ayr United does remain a worry and, as they showed at Tannadice the week before last, they have to be regarded as serious promotion contenders.Ross County and this weekend’s opponents Inverness also remain challengers.And another disappointment against them could have fans worried about that early Christmas gt."},{"url":null,"title":"we are the team no one wants to play says dundees gensy kusunga","story":"Gensy Kusunga says Dundee used to be the team everybody wanted to play – now they are the team nobody wants to face he’s urged his team-mates to keep their focus.The impressive defensive display which earned the Dark Blues a - draw at home to Rangers, despite being reduced to  men after just  minutes, lted the side off the foot of the Premiership table for the first time since August.And that was in no small part down to the solid defensive display from Angolan international Kusunga, alongside centre-back partner Andy Boyle.Between them, they repelled everything Rangers threw into the box to keep up their unbeaten run, which now stretches to four matches.And the confidence which is oozing through the team now, allied to that dogged defensive display, will mean nobody will fancy facing Dundee in the coming weeks, evenit is Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and Celtic away next.Kusunga said: “I hope that is the case!“It’s good to hear that other teams won’t want to play us.“Before everyone wanted to play us to take confidence! Now it has turned around but we need to continue.“It’s good to have confidence – but not too much!“We have to still work, work, work and not feel we are there because we drew and won one game.“We have to stay focused and, hopefully, we can get some good results before the break.”The former Basel defender is delighted the club’s form has turned around but has urged the Dark Blues not to relax as they bid to continue their resurgence in the busiest time of the season.After three matches on the road in seven days, Dundee will welcome Livingston to Dens Park on Boxing Day before St Johnstone make the short trip from Perth on December .Despite moving off the bottom of the Premiership table, Kusunga knows the work has only just begun and wants the “belief” that has surged through the team to continue.He added: “We are happy because we had to work hard for the draw with  men against Rangers.“It was a good game, a massive game for us and to take points was the most important thing.“We are happy but we need to stay focused.“The road is a long one and we need keep our focus for the next game and the many games in December where we need to get points.“We showed a lot of belief on Sunday,  against  for so long and never put our heads down. We stayed strong, stayed together and everybody worked, worked, worked – when you do that you can get results, that’s the key.“It was important for the confidence to keep our run going but we can’t relax, the way is long and we have to take things game after game and do the maximum we can.”The dference in Dundee’s displays over the past few weeks and the rest of the campaign is a marked one with the side trebling their points total in the last four matches.And Kusunga says taking responsibility as a team rather than pointing to inidual errors has been a massive factor.He said: “Everybody is taking responsibility. Before we could always say we didn’t win because of one mistake, you need to take responsibility and work like men.”And he’s urged the Dark Blues to repeat their show against Rangers in the coming weeks.He added: “Every game is hard, the opponents are strong in every game and we can’t think about playing a small team or playing a big team.“Every match is dficult and we need to work hard the same against whoever we play.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wellgate centre car park reopens after early morning disruption","story":"A key car park in Dundee city centre suddenly closed this morning, causing disruption for shoppers and city workers.A shutter fault at the Wellgate Shopping Centre, which holds about  vehicles, meant it could not open to motorists.A barrier blocked entry and there was a laminated notice saying the car park was closed until further notice.One commuter told the Tele: #There is a barrier blocking entry but there is no warning on any of the roads saying the car park is closed.#I have a permit for the Wellgate and had to park at Bell Street, costing me £. today.#I fear that there will be a lot of congestion when people go to work because traffic will be backed up along East Marketgait.#A spokeswoman for the centre said: “The entrance shutter is stuck closed.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead opens up for christmas","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe success of independent retailers depends on imagination and initiative, and Lochgilphead shops will be showing plenty of that # and festive spirit # in the weeks leading up to Christmas.Lochgilphead is, arguably, seeing a mini-revival, with new businesses outnumbering closures in recent times.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy.

But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes!

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

on behalf of Ofgem,Jason Beer QC said it accepted signicant failings, including not communicating with the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment , which conceived the scheme, as well as it could have done.ldquoThere were many things that Ofgem could and should have done better in relation to its administration of the scheme, he told the inquiry.Jason Beer QC makes a final submission

say these are not failures by Ofgem to communicate concerns about the design of the scheme at its inception, they are failures by those to whom the concerns were communicated to heed them and to act upon them.Deti was led by Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Fosterwhen the RHI scheme was designed, and later her colleague Jonathan Bellover the time that costs spiralled.The inquiry previously heard claims that DUP special advisers pushed to delay the introduction of cost control measures to the scheme.This has been denied by a number of special advisers.Earlier on Wednesday, the inquiry heard

engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of the Kintyre Seasports Project and remains committed to supporting its development for the future.#We commend the efforts of all in reaching this point and look forward to being a

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

lawyer appearing on behalf of Ofgem at a public inquiry in Belfast said it accepted signicant failings, but insisted those failings did not cause the key problems in the scheme.The Renewable Heat Incentive sparked a scandal in late  when it emerged that costs had spiralled due to over-generous subsidies being paid to encourage the use of green energy.The result was an anticipated massive overspend, falling to the Northern Irish taxpayer to pick up.The fiasco led to a political row, the resignation of Northern Irelandrsquos then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness and the collapse of the powersharing government in January .The RHI Inquiry, led by retired judge Sir Patrick Coghlin, is hearing final submissions this week before it reaches its conclusions at a later date.Speaking on behalf of Ofgem,Jason Beer QC said it accepted signicant failings, including not communicating with the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment , which conceived the scheme, as well as it could have done.ldquoThere were many things that Ofgem could and should have done better in relation to its administration of the scheme, he told the inquiry.But he said it ldquocanrsquot be concluded that those failings caused the key problem in the scheme.Mr Beer said Ofgem had warned Deti over the design of the RHI scheme.ldquoOfgem lucidly and cogently identied a number of the risks about the design of the scheme to the department when the department was drafting the regulations in November , he said.ldquoWe say these are not failures by Ofgem to communicate concerns about the design of the scheme at its inception, they are failures by those to whom the concerns were communicated to heed them and to act upon them.Deti was led by Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Fosterwhen the RHI scheme was designed, and later her colleague Jonathan Bellover the time that costs spiralled.The inquiry previously heard claims that DUP special advisers pushed to delay the introduction of cost control measures to the scheme.This has been denied by a number of special advisers.Earlier on Wednesday, the inquiry heard that an Ofgem lawyer,John Jackson, advised a colleague against handing police some of the information it held about an application to the RHI scheme by then DUP special adviser Stephen Brimstone.The Police Service of Northern Ireland investigated an allegation of fraud it received over Mr Brimstonersquos application. No crime was detected.Mr Jackson said: ldquoNothing in the documents, or the conclusions that they reached, wouldrsquove assisted the police in a criminal prosecution of Stephen Brimstone.Ofgem audited Mr Brimstonersquos RHI boiler and concluded he joined the scheme legitimately.Mr Beer said he would not comment on that before having time to consider it.Pressed by  memberDame Una OrsquoBrien,he suggested it may not be appropriate for the inquiry to ldquodraw broad conclusions about Ofgemrsquos ldquoattitudes and cultures on the basis ldquoof a relatively junior lawyerrsquos emailed advice in one case."},{"url":null,"title":"matthew-lindsay-whod-be-a-scottish-referee-not-me-they-need-var-to-silence-the-social-media-snipers","story":"Having run a few miles in the boots of Scotlandrsquos referees, a more derided, maligned and persecuted bunch you are unlikely to encounter, last week my admiration for and empathy with our match officials has suddenly sky rocketed.At a time when both the competence and impartiality of our match officials are being increasingly called in to question by irate fans and even, alas, by managers and clubs, it proved to be an enlightening experience.Not being a supporter of Aberdeen, Celtic, Hearts, Hibernian or Rangers, I have never subscribed to the widely-held view that referees in this country are biased against a particular team due to their background or leaningsAs the late, great Tom ldquoTiny Wharton, the iconic Scottish whistler of the s, s and s, once told me over a cup of tea and a chinwag in his Newton Mearns home ldquoyour religion changes every time you run up the park in an Old Firm game.Yet, I have certainly been highly critical about the handling of big games and scathing about he award of critical decisions in print in the past. In future, though, I will not be quite so hasty to pass judgement.My first ndash and hopefully last ndash experience of refereeing a match came when I went to watch my eldest son play for his school team. As the game was about to kick-off it emerged no whistler had turned up. So I got tapped on the shoulder by one of the coaches and asked to step in to the breach.Now, it was hardly the second leg of the Copa Liberatadores final between Boca Juniors and River Plate in the Bernabeu. It was a seven-a-side game between a bunch a  and -year-old boys on one third of an articial pitch in the suburbs of Glasgow. Nevertheless, it gave an eye-opening insight into the lot of the man-in-black.Who knew, for example, that determining which player touched the ball last in a   challenge and which team should subsequently be awarded a throw-in could be dficult  Having a linesman would have helped. But it was startling how something so seemingly straightforward could be so challenging.The reaction to many of my calls ndash indignation, outrage, tears, recrimination, disbelief ndash was also unexpected.Anyone who says that kids arenrsquot influenced by how high-profile professional players behave on television is, as Steve Clarke might well say, talking out of their backside.One particular objectionable urchin, who must have stood all of three feet tall in his studs, spent a couple of minutes after the game offering a less than complimentary appraisal of my performance. Apparently, for example, shouting isnrsquot allowed in boysrsquo football and is punishable by a free-kick. You learn something new every day.As for the spectators! Their conduct of the smattering of onlookers in what was effectively a kickabout left much to be desired. One especially joyless parent on the sidelines took time to inform me ldquothat was a blue ball after one of my dubious calls. Had he sensed my deep-rooted anti-blue agenda Then there was my positioning. I made Willie Young look like Kylian Mbappe as a I lumbered about the pitch trying to keep up with the action. But I lost count of the occasions I found myself either in the way of play or in a hopeless vantage point.How do referees possibly work out in the blink of an eyea player who was in an offside position had been interfering with play after a goal is scored by a team mate  How do they cope with making such a call in front of tens of thousands of people  The mind truly boggled.Several Stella after the ordeal, I concluded that referees are selfless not clueless iniduals, have a nigh on impossible task and deserve our sympathy and support not abuse and opprobrium.At the very least, they need VAR. The system, as we saw at Russia , isnrsquot perfect, but in an age when every passage of play is filmed from half a dozen dferent angles and incidents dissected the instant they happen, it would help quell a growing disaffection with match officials and make their lives easier."},{"url":null,"title":"westminster-reacts-to-theresa-mays-meaningful-vote-delay","story":"• Westminster holds emergency debate over delay of meaningful vote• Nicola Sturgeon calls on Labour to lodge vote of no confidence in Theresa Mays government"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9075296.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jean-claude-juncker-there-is-no-room-whatsoever-for-brexit-renegotiation","story":"The President of the European CommissionJean-Claude Juncker won applause from MEPs as he said: \"There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation, but of course there is roomused intelligently, there is room enough to give further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement.\"This will not happen: everyone has to note that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened.\":Brexit live: Westminster fury as Theresa May cancels voteHe confirmed he would meet Mrs May on Tuesday evening but reiterated: \"The deal we have achieved is the best deal possible - it is the only deal possible.\"The statement came as the Prime Minister embarked on emergency Brexit talks with her Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte in The Hague.He offered a glimmer of hope to Mrs May by saying there was room to give \"further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement\".The Prime Minister will also meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday in her bid to gain reassurances on the exit deal from European leaders ahead of a crunch EU summit on Thursday, after leaving Westminster in turmoil.:Nicola Sturgeon accuses Jeremy Corbyn of stalling over vote of no confidence in Theresa Mays leadershipShe will then travel on to Brussels, where she is due to meet European Council president Donald Tusk at around pm and Mr Juncker at .pm, UK time.Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom suggested Mrs May was seeking changes that would give Parliament an additional \"democratic ability to decide\".\"That might include an addendum to the Withdrawal Agreement that sets out that Parliament will vote prior to going into a backstop, should that prove necessary, and potentially that the EU parliament and UK parliament must vote every year thereafter to provide that legitimacy for the UK to stay in the backstop, should that prove necessary,\" she told BBC Radio s Today programme.\"So there are plenty of options for the PM to talk to the EU about that dont involve reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, but that would provide the legal text as a part of the Withdrawal Agreement, through perhaps an addendum.\"Mrs May, who is facing repeated calls from leading Tory Brexiteers to be replaced as PM, was forced to abandon the Commons vote as the scale of opposition to the Brexit deal, especially regarding proposed backstop arrangements for the Irish border, threatened a crushing rejection of her plans."},{"url":null,"title":"mackintosh-bronze-unveiled-by-kelpies-sculptor-andy-scott","story":"Andy Scott, the sculptor who created the Kelpies, has unveiled his new statue of Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow ndash only a short walk from the ruins of his that artist, designer and architectrsquos greatest building at the Glasgow School of Art which was destroyed by fire earlier this year.Scott attended that school for five years, and said it was a signicant challenge to create a three-dimensional portrait of Mackintosh, which was unveiled yesterday on the th anniversary of his death.It is the first full scale statue of a person that Mr Scott has created ldquofor many years, he said.Much of his recent work has been equine statues.The statue of Mackintosh, unveiled as part of a housing regeneration project in the Anderston area of the city, sees him sitting on a chair, furniture he designed for the Argyle Street Tea Room..

The pattern is repeated in nearby North Ayrshire, where those renting homes spend pound a month compared to homeowners pound.The average Bill for people in rented accommodation in North Lanarkshire topped pound while mortgages were said to even out at around pound.In Falkirk renters can expect to pay pound compared to those owning property spending pound per month, in Clackmannanshire the dference is pound compared to pound, while in West Dunbartonshire a rented home costs pound while the average mortgage for a similar property is pound.Other areas where owning a home beat renting were South Lanarkshire, where monthly mortgage costs were pound compared to pound, Inverclyde, where the typical monthly payment was pound versus pound in rent, Dundee City, where mortgages were pound compared to pound, and Renfrewshire, where the cost of owning a home was pound while renting was pound. Zoopla identied Hartlepool in the north-east of England as the location where buying could be most cost-effective when compared with renting.The cost of monthly mortgage repayments in Hartlepool could typically be .% cheaper than renting, the research calculated.At the other end of the spectrum, outside London, St Albans was found to be the local authority area where renting was found to be most cost-effective compared with buying, followed by the district of South Buckinghamshire.: Gap closing betweenRural and urban property prices.Lawrence Hall, spokesperson for Zoopla, said: ldquoIn some areas renters are paying a premium when you compare their outgoings to that of homeowners servicing a mortgage.\"Of course, buying isnrsquot always a viable option for those who arenrsquot able to put down a deposit or want the flexibility renting can offer.\"Those looking for comparatively cost-effective places to rent should keep an eye on the countryrsquos top locations such as St. Albans, where renting is almost a quarter cheaper than servicing a mortgage.Figures from the Scottish Government show that from  to , all areas of Scotland - with the exception of Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire - saw increases in rent for two-bedroom properties.These ranged from . per cent in Ayrshire to almost  % in Lothian and Glasgow.During the past year the Scottish Government helped fund , social rented homes, an increase of  homes on the previous year.Graeme Brown, Director of Shelter Scotland, said that many people in rented accommodation struggle the high costs of monthly payments to landlords.He said: \"The single biggest reason people call us is because they are having dficulty affording a home, and private-renters are over-represented in those who contact us for help.ldquoHigh rents are a particular problem in places where demand simply outstrips supply and the cost of owning is so high that renting from private landlords is the only option for many.\": Housebuilder Bellway warns of Brexit risk to peak selling season#However, he said that comparisons between the cost of a mortgage and average rents could be misleading, as they did not take into account the other financial aspects of owning a home.Mr Brown said: \"To compare monthly rent with monthly mortgage payments is far too simplistic. It takes no account of mortgage interest, repairs, maintenance, buildings or le insurance or the cost of furnishing a home which is included in rent in many cases.\"He added: \"If all goes well mortgage-holders will one day have an asset but there are costs and risks which come with buying which mean it is not the best option for everyone.\"ldquoWhile private rents are too high for many people, the answer is to ensure we have a signicant increase in secure, affordable homes for social rent.

Although the number of teachers increased overall, in almost a third of councils totals fell.And the figures showed nearly , teachers are being paid for through PEF funding rather than core grants, which provides less long-term security.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union, said PEF funding was ldquoinflating the figures.ldquoThese posts, valuable though they are, are short-term only and not guaranteed to be retained in future years, he said.ldquoThese posts were always intended to be on top of the existing workforce and,you strip them out, there are just over , teachers in Scotland compared to more than , in . The EIS also attacked a continuing decline in the number of qualied teachers working in nurseries.However, Mr Swinney said teacher levels were the highest this decade, adding: ldquoThe average size of primary one classes has been dropping consistently in recent years, which is particularly important as helping children in the early years is crucialwe are to close the attainment gap between the most and least deprived.There is another concern about the statistical publication from the Scottish Government on achievements in literacy and numeracy.The background notes describe the statistics as ldquoexperimental because they are based on the professional judgements of teachers after the Scottish Government scrapped the previous system of pupil surveys.Of the  local authorities that submitted information to the current publication only one third said they were ldquogenerally confident in the robustness of the data.That means Scotland does not have a reliable system of evaluation of basic standards allowing for detailed comparisons of councils or schools, despite the introduction of standardised assessments.Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said the situation was unacceptable.He said: ldquoExperts have warned it will now take years to build up the evidence of how our pupils are really getting on."},{"url":null,"title":"derek-mackay-could-bypass-greens-to-secure-scottish-budget","story":"One option would be to rely on the two LibDem MSPs for Orkney and Shetland, who voted for the last budget because of a pound.m investment in local ferry services.The support of Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott would have enabled the SNP minority government to secure its budget by  votes to , eventhe Greens had opposed it.A Scottish Government source said the experience had demonstrated there were ldquointeresting options available, adding: ldquoTherersquos more than one way to skin this cat.Green MSP Andy Wightman also admitted the budget could pass without his partythe finance secretary won over MSPs with ldquopork barrel spending in their constituencies.He told The Herald: ldquoLast year did demonstrate the government can rely on the support of constituency members on matters of importance to their constituents.ldquoThey got those two votes from the Liberals.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own Parliaments or Assemblies with substantial control over domestic matters, both legislative and administrative.But, as the Lords Constitution Committee reported in  ldquothe largest and most powerful nation in the UK is without separate recognition and representation.There have been ious attempts to deal with this, but all have been unsatisfactory. The Tory Government tried a isive plan based on ldquoEnglish Votes for English Lawswith only English MPs able voting on purely English legislation at Westminster. That has been a spectacular failure.On administrative devolution, there has been an a la carte menu of dferent schemes with catchy titles like Northern Powerhouse,Mayors, City Deals and Midlands Engine which has produced a piecemeal pattern with most of the power still remaining in Whitehall.Arguably the most successful have been the eightMayors, but they have dfering degrees of power which leaves them, as the Commons Constitution Committee observed, ldquostruggling with the piecemeal delegation of powers and s. Meanwhile, country areas are untouched.The disparity in fiscal devolution is reflected in the Scottish Parliament controlling  per cent of tax revenues, Wales  per cent and Northern Ireland  per cent while English local authorities collect only nine per cent of their revenue.So the challenge is how to produce a more coherent and comprehensive system of devolution for the whole UK which also addresses the English democratic deficit.Some favour an English Parliament which is attractive for legislation but does not deal with the demand for administrative decentralisation within England, where dissatisfaction with Whitehall is just as strong as it was in Scotland.Various attempts to start regional devolution within England, including John Prescottrsquos plan which died with a failed referendum in the north-east, have perished because Whitehall departments clung to all the real powers.The clue to solving the conundrum lies in Scotland where our Constitutional Convention in thes produced the blueprint for the Scottish Parliament when Labour came to power in . It involved MPs, peers, political parties, churches, unions and civic society with a high level of public engagement.Robert Hazell of The Constitution Unit supports a similar UK Constitutional Convention to build cross-party consensus, to develop a more coherent package of reform and generate wide public engagement. The aim would be to produce a coherent and comprehensive structure of devolution for the whole UK.Such a structure could also enable the House of Lords to be replaced by a Senate of the Nations and Regions indirectly elected by the devolved authorities. Such a chamber would then have some democratic legitimacy without challenging the primacy of the House of Commons.The Liberal Democrats, as federalists, support a Convention and Labour is committed to setting up one when in power.I donrsquot see why,the present Government refuses to set one up, it cannot be done now by Labour, other parties and bodies, as we did in Scotland, so we again have a blueprint ready to implement. Where Scotland led, the UK can surely follow."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-derek-mackay-should-be-bold-and-take-the-chance-to-reshape-our-fiscal-landscape","story":"The big issue, had it not been for the Brexit shambles, would be the Scottish Governmentrsquos expected decision not to raise the threshold for higher rate tax payers to pound,, as announced in the UK Budget. This would normally be portrayed by the Conservatives and much of the press as an irresponsible Nat Tax increase that would ldquohammer middle income earners, even though it does nothing of the kind. Embarrassingly for Labour, the Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, controversially supported the Tory threshold rise, which of course is an effective tax cut for higher earners.Scots earning around pound, are a vocerous group and they could find themselves paying pound, more in income tax than they would had they been living in England. Thatrsquos serious money. However, few of the , or so higher rate payers are in a position to pay the relocation costs of fleeing to the border, eventhey wanted to. And of course many wonrsquot actually notice, since they will see no increase in their tax bills.So, with political attention where, Mr Mackay has a unique opportunity to raise tax without actually raising taxes ndash the ultimate stealth tax. Just doing nothing brings a conditional windfall of more than pound million, according to the Fraser of Allander Institute The vast majority of Scots, anyway, make a lot less than pound,. Median gross earnings are less than half that figure. Mr Mackay could fiddle around with the new rates and bands, and deliver a headline tax cut to half of Scottish workers and still be quids in. A useful little tax giveaway in what could be an election year. ndash though hersquod be wise to avoid pulling out too many budgetary rabbits since, with the Scottish economy expected to slow down after Brexit, overall tax revenues are likely to be depressed in future.Indeed, Mr Mackay has more than usual reason this year to be grateful for the much-maligned Barnett Formula. Thanks to Chancellor Philip Hammondrsquos increase in NHS spending, the Scottish Government will receive poundm for health alone next year through Barnet ldquoconsequentials. With NHS boards like Lothian plunging into the red, this has come not a moment too soon.As is well known, the SNP Government failed in past years to devote all the health revenue increases to the Scottish NHS. This time Mr Mackay has made clear every penny will go to health. Half a billion should at least paper over the cracks in a service which still has widespread public support, but has serious problems. Though no one should underestimate the capacity of the NHS to swallow vast amounts of public money.With new medicines and procedures, health spending needs to rise by around two per cent just to stand still. Scotlandrsquos population is ageing rapidly and older people need expensive care. Waiting targets in A E are being missed. There is a recruitment crisis that is only going to get worse as doctors and nurses stop coming from Europe after Brexit. The spending watchdog, Audit Scotland, reported recently that the NHS in Scotland is ldquofinancially unsustainable.The injection of cash from Westminster will put this crisis off for some years. However, the sheer volume of resources devoted to the NHS is creating problems where. Nearly half of the entire Scottish budget now goes on health, and this has squeezed local government. Thanks to austerity, council spending has been cut to the bone over the last decade, and there is little prospect of them being able to catch up. Crucial services like education, social care and waste recycling are disintegrating. Teachers are threatening to go on strikethey donrsquot get a  per cent pay increase.Council cuts canrsquot go on much longer without causing irreparable damage to communities. The obvious answer is to allow councils to raise more money themselves. But the Scottish Government allowed them to raise the council tax cap last year by three per cent, and it didnrsquot make much of a dent in the problem. Councils are also raising cash from things like parking charges and the ending of second home discounts, but more needs to be done. Many believe that only a replacement of the council tax itself, by a local income tax or land and property wealth tax, could close the gap.The Scottish Green Party, whose six pack of MSPs are threatening to vote against todayrsquos budget, could potentially bring down the Scottish Government over council tax reform. A firm timetable for its abolition is their green red line. But I doubt Scottish voters could cope with another parliament in crisis right now, so their co-leader Patrick Harvie will probably settle for rather less. Possibly movement towards the ldquotransitory visitor levy, otherwise known as the tourist tax.Itrsquos not entirely clear why Nicola Sturgeon is so leery of a tax that is applied in most European cities. Edinburgh hotel rates are now so high ndash more than pound a night on average ndash that a two per cent tax would hardly be noticed, especially since foreign visitors are paying  per cent less thanks to the collapse in the value of the pound. Never has low-hanging fruit dangled so tantalisingly close to a finance ministerrsquos grasp.Some talk of the agreeable and intelligent Derek Mackay as a future leader of the SNP, and he certainly has the chance to shine today.

It has been a gradual build-up over the years but I think the way the Highland Council has been dealing with issues has not helped and it has not helped any of you whatsoever.Mrs Manson promised a ldquolistening council when she took the reins from Steve Barron last month. That has included a y series of drop-ins across the sprawling Highland Council area inviting people to share what they feel the local authority does well and where therersquos room for improvement.The council faces a massive budget gap against a backdrop of simmering public discontent over areduction in services as belts are tightened.She said she was willing to look at all issues raised. She said: ldquoI need to think about how we structure staff in the council so that people feel there is an equal service out there.The planned introduction of parking charges to a town which boasts freely available space prompted warnings. Councillor Margaret Paterson said: ldquoI can tell you that the majority of people in Dingwall want you to stop imposing parking charges. And as a council you donrsquot care how the High Street will go down the plug hole because of it.Mrs Manson said she would consider the concerns raised during the drop-ins and would report back in January.What do YOU think  We welcome feedback.

This wee semi-detached cottage had no bathroom, no running hot water and no inside toilet so inevitably we loved it. Jeannie, our rotund grandmother, really was the stereotypical granny living in a house at the bottom of the woods and spoiled us within her limited means . My grandfather, also Jimmy, was an astonishingly good-looking man with crystal blue eyes he was a Stalinist for rather longer than was fashionable, and worked at Glenochil, the huge whisky bond, as a foreman, which to my unpractised eye meant he sat and read for a living: he was the only man I’ve ever known who took three novels to work. But he saved a man’s le in a terrible accident, being injured himself into a premature death – another, sadder, story as well.Anyway, Papa Jimmy used to take us for a walk in the woods on a fine day, thenus to the house for our lunch, which always included masses of butter, a substance somewhat rationed in our own home. Jimmy would retire to his chair and read the paper and chain smoke, ashing his fags into an ornate standing ashtray which was an object of great fascination to me and which I eventually inherited. On these walks, a bit like Uncle Pumblechook in ‘Great Expectations’, Papa Jimmy would ask us questions relating to our general knowledge – the times tables, dates in Scottish history, capital cities of the world. This once led to an argument – of quite heated proportions, because both these Jimmys were obstinate fellows – about the capital of Ceylon. Young Jimmy, probably about , knew it was Colombo old Jimmy, about , insisted it was Kandy. At eight, I did not feel well placed to intervene and contented myself with playing with bugs.: Cameron Wyllie: Face facts, some kids are smarter than othersGeneral knowledge was part of our lives then it was part of everyone’s. Twenty years later, in the s, as a young schoolteacher, I would always have a quiz book ready in my desk as an end-of-term treat: classes in teams, rounds of questions, sweeties as prizes. Even ‘less academically able’ boys – for this was a boys’ school – knew stuff, random facts about Russia or prime numbers or current affairs. Thirty years on, at the end of my career, I used to take great pleasure in the success of the school quiz teams indeed, we even granted our ‘quizzers’ the sacred right of ‘colours’ eventually, so the really successful ones went round the school with blazer badges saying ‘quiz’. No-one but me and other gnarled ancients thought this was remotely strange – that something as ordinary as general knowledge was in our youth had become a specialised extra-curricular activity – you did ‘quiz’ while others played the oboe or threw the discus.Does this matter  Clearly, the school curriculum has to move with the times and technology means that all of us can get away with knowing less stuff than we used to – when you don’t know somethingyou just Google it. Who is that actress  Who was that king  What, for God’s sake, is the capital of Ceylon, and why is it not called Ceylon anymore, and what can be done to stop brain cells oozing out my ears ...  I can’t be alone in suppressing a deeply rooted grumble when the nice girl in the shop reaches for a calculator to work out what  per cent of £ is, and then laboriously subtracts £. from £ etc etc. But, does it matter : Cameron Wyllie: Here’s how the snowflake generation can toughen upWell, it must a bit. If you don’t know that you need to know something, then you can’t Google it. Lots of information that was reasonably common currency simply isn’t there in the minds of young people and has been replaced by dferent skills, of which they have many. However,you are, for example, teaching a text that refers directly or indirectly to something  – the mention of Icarus in a poem by W H Auden, say, and the clever children in your Higher English class don’t have a scoobie who Icarus was, then they are, quite clearly, not able to understand the poem. Again, in the great scheme of things, this may not matter very much, but,we do not have things to connect, then E M Forster’s much-quoted dictum “only connect” cannot happen some intellectual breakthroughs just require two bits of factual knowledge to be laid side by side. All of this may just be a reaction to skills-based learning. Someone who did O-grade history in the s or s just would not recognise a National  paper today and I suspect that most history teachers would say that these changes are entirely right. I honestly think there is validity in both approaches, but I’m afraid I also have a little feeling in my tummy that says that knowing more things is one of the proofs that you are grown up.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies. LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27497  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinSinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit. - Mary Lou McDonald TDAmid all the chaos in Westminster, there are few certainties as to where the Brexit circus will stumble to next.Brexit began as a squabble between the rich and right wing boys of the Tory party. Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1304912.jpg--.jpg?1544529142000\n","title":"ballymena woman is guest professor at chinese university","story":"A BALLYMENA woman has secured a prestigious position as Guest Professor at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China.Professor Dr Ingrid Fleming is the daughter of former Ballymena Mayor, councillor Audrey Wales.Professor Fleming started her education at Carniny Primary and Cambridge House Grammar School.She then studied Biochemistry and Pharmacology at Aston University in England, continuing with her PhD at the Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg, France.Professor Fleming is currently Chair of the Institute for Vascular Signalling and works in Frankfurt, Germany.Speaking to theabout her new role, she said: A guest professor is someone who agrees to spend between two-four weeks every year in another university lecturing and working on combined projects as well as mentoring students etc. It’s not too onerous – its more of an award - but it’s a great way of recruiting young talent back to your own lab.I have been in China a few times but the links to the Huazhong University in Wuhan are the strongest as I work on similar topics to the cardiology department and I have hosted students from there in the past.

The draw of playing with her friends a few metres away is just too much for her.“She loves to be involved in everything,# says Clotilde, #especially helping to prepare food and cook. She#s quick to learn.#The proud mum of four is thankful that Ines and her other children are growing up strong and healthy. She puts it down to a combination of a ied and nutritious diet and the help and advice of community-based health workers, carers and volunteers supported by international development charity Concern Worldwide.Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, where more than a third of the population don’t have enough food to eat. Poverty, political instability and scarce rainfall all contribute to high levels of food insecurity and hunger. And children, who make up around half the population, are disproportionately affected.What makes it even more of a challenge is that Clotilde and her family live in Cibitoke – an area with one of the highest levels of chronic malnutrition in the country. Every other child living there is chronically malnourished.Hunger prevents them from developing. It causes stunting and weakens their immune systems making them more susceptible to diseases. Their ability to grow and learn is permanently damaged. By the time they are two-years-old, the effects of chronic malnutrition are irreversible.The overall level of acute malnutrition in the area is also poor, with one in every  children moderately or severely malnourished. Last year, the UN estimated that as many as . million children in Burundi were impacted, with almost , under-fives requiring treatment for severe malnutrition.It is for that reason that aid agencies like Concern are targeting pregnant women, and mums with young children. The aim is to prevent malnutrition in the first place or spot the early signs before it takes hold.A few kilometres away, we meet another -year-old mum, Charlotte Nzeyimana. She has been walking for almost two hours carrying baby Keddy on her back and with four-year-old daughter Kyntia by her side.In the shade of a banana grove, Charlotte shares her concerns about young Kyntia, who sits motionless on the ground beside her. “My daughter is not very healthy,” she says.Seven months ago little Kyntia was diagnosed with oedema – a symptom of severe acute malnutrition. She was admitted to hospital and recovered after a month. But her situation remains precarious.“I breastfed her until she was three-years-old,# says Charlotte. #After that, she began to get sick. She has never had a ied diet – and has only ever eaten cassava paste.#In the next few weeks, though, Charlotte will begin to reap the benefits of the same vital health and nutrition advice and support that Clotilde enjoys.The programme, which started in July, is run by Concern with funding from the UK government. Last year, as part of the overseas charity’s Food in a Fragile World appeal, the public donated just over £, which was matched pound-for-pound by the government. That matched funding is now being used in this part of Burundi to help improve the lives of more than , under-fives at risk of malnutrition.At the heart of Concern#s efforts to tackle hunger is a team of  skilled Community Health Workers . They are trained to detect the early signs of malnutrition on the spot and treat certain illnesses and infections. Concern also supports , Care Group Volunteers and  Mother Leaders who promote breastfeeding and good nutrition, food preparation and hygiene practices.#We rely on our Community Health Worker,# says Clotilde. #She has treated my children for malaria and diarrhoea. Andthey fall sick again, she will know what to do.#Both Clotilde and her husband earn what they can from casual work cultivating cassava and corn. Between harvests and during lean times they sell eggs, buns, soap and home-made banana juice to friends and neighbours. It is enough for them to survive on.#The CHW has told us the importance of having a balanced diet,” she says. “We eat twice a day – mostly beans, corn, rice, cassava paste, sweet potatoes and vegetables.”On a steep hillside in Bukinanyana not far from where we met Charlotte, Community Health Worker Jeannette Icimanishatse is greeted by shouts and laughter. The -year-old grandmother is visiting one of ten households on her weekly rounds. It is clear that she has gained the trust and respect of her neighbours, encouraging them to take simple preventative measures to positively impact their children’s lives.“I am proud of what I do,” says Jeanette. “Mums depend on us for help. It is rewarding to know that we are doing something to make the le of the community better.”Community Health Workers like Jeannette refer any cases of severe acute malnutrition to the local health centre for specialist treatment. They even help to arrange transport and encourage mums to save a little for emergencies. Mothers whose children are moderately malnourished are enrolled in community-based nutrition demonstrations where they receive advice on key feeding and care practices. They are also given support to build a kitchen garden which enables them to have vegetables all year round, and an opportunity to be part of a savings and loans scheme.It is a highly effective approach, according to Sebastien Sebahizi, Concern’s Health and Nutrition Programme Manager in Cibitoke, because it focuses on behaviour change and peer-to-peer communication.“What we have observed,” he says, “is that some mothers in exactly the same living conditions have children who are healthy. We bring them into the programme as Mother Leaders and Care Group Volunteers, so that mums who are struggling can spend time with them and see how it’s done.”A further spin-off from tackling malnutrition at grassroots level is that less of a strain is placed on the therapeutic and stabilisation services provided by local clinics.“What we hope to achieve,” says Sebastien, “is to halve the number of childhood nutrition-related consultations in local health centres. That will ease the pressure on the system and enable medical staff to deal with more complicated cases.“But ultimately, our goal is to reduce childhood malnutrition and give more young children the opportunity to grow up healthy and well. It is something each one of them deserves.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"food bank demand in north belfast soars for yet another christmas","story":"THE demand for food for those in need this Christmas is as high as ever before after another tough year for many people in North Belfast.A year of drastic changes to welfare reform and the roll-out of the controversial universal credit in November has left more and more people in need of essential food products over the upcoming Christmas period.The annual drive by North Belfast Advice Partnership and Ligoniel Improvement Association is now on for donations for this year’s initiative to help local families across North Belfast.Sinead McKinley, who is helping co-ordinating this year’s food drive, said this year’s appeal is their most important ever.“This year once again we have been inundated with requests for food parcels and Christmas hampers,” she explained.“It has been a really tough year for families, with all the dferent changes to welfare policy on top of the higher cost of food and living generally and the uncertainty around Brexit, it means more people are in food poverty.“Utility bills are also getting higher yet benefits have been frozen for four years.“There is also the cruel Universal Credit which I believe has resulted mainly in an increased demand for the food bank.“People are on a five-week wait for the changeover in their benefits which has put them in debt coming up to Christmas. There is no mitigation payment for that crossover period because the Assembly collapsed before they could pass the legislation.”Started in , the local food bank drive resulted in a record number of people receiving hampers last Christmas, with a total of  hampers delivered to iniduals and families in need.Once again, Sinead is appealing for long-le food products, fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products and festive toys and gts amongst the vital donations for this year’s appeal.“We want to build on last year’s successful food bank drive success which resulted in  Christmas hampers delivered to those in need.“This year we expect the demand to be much higher and we will continue to work with our partners in St Vincent de Paul, St Patrick’s Soup Kitchen, Haven Outreach and Oasis Food Bank on the Shankill to meet demand.“We want to maximise resources to support a bigger group of people. Food is always the priority – it frees up other money for them to pay bills and spend a few pounds at Christmas time.“Christmas hampers are vital so that local families get through the festive period. There are extra costs because more people are off and stay at home which means extra heating bills.“This year has been so tough for everyone, especially low-paid workers, those on benefits and those affected by universal credit.“It has been really bad.Unfortunately, it is a sign of the times that food banks will become the norm for so many people.“Universal Credit is so cruel and will continue to roll out to so many more people. Soup kitchens and homeless charities are a leline for people. It is a helping hand for people.“I would appeal to local people to once again support this year’s food bank appeal- people in North Belfast are so generous when it comes to donating at Christmas.”Items can be donated to this year’s Food Bank appeal by bringing them to the Wolfhill Centre in Ligoniel, or they can be dropped into a number of other community centres including Ardoyne Association , Ashton Centre , Tar Isteach , Vine Centreand Ballysillan Community Forum ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"leading economist to give talk on brexit and a united ireland","story":"LEADING economist David McWilliams will be speaking at a Féile an Phobail event tomorrow on Brexit and its implications for the ending of partition.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university graduations december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But he said it “can’t be concluded that those failings caused the key problem in the scheme”.Mr Beer said Ofgem had warned Deti over the design of the RHI scheme.“Ofgem lucidly and cogently identied a number of the risks about the design of the scheme to the department when the department was drafting the regulations in November ,” he said.“We say these are not failures by Ofgem to communicate concerns about the design of the scheme at its inception, they are failures by those to whom the concerns were communicated to heed them and to act upon them.”Deti was led by Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Fosterwhen the RHI scheme was designed, and later her colleague Jonathan Bellover the time that costs spiralled.The inquiry previously heard claims that DUP special advisers pushed to delay the introduction of cost control measures to the scheme.This has been denied by a number of special advisers.Earlier on Wednesday, the inquiry heard that an Ofgem lawyer, John Jackson, advised a colleague against handing police some of the information it held about an application to the RHI scheme by then DUP special adviser Stephen Brimstone.The Police Service of Northern Ireland investigated an allegation of fraud it received over Mr Brimstone’s application. No crime was detected.Mr Jackson said: “Nothing in the documents, or the conclusions that they reached, would’ve assisted the police in a criminal prosecution of Stephen Brimstone.”Ofgem audited Mr Brimstone’s RHI boiler and concluded he joined the scheme legitimately.Mr Beer said he would not comment on that before having time to consider it.Pressed by  member Dame Una O’Brien, he suggested it may not be appropriate for the inquiry to “draw broad conclusions” about Ofgem’s “attitudes and cultures” on the basis “of a relatively junior lawyer’s emailed advice in one case”."},{"url":null,"title":"paul is light years ahead when it comes to festive decorations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And she insisted a general election would not be “in the national interest”.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn denounced her actions as “totally and absolutely unacceptable”, while the SNP’s leader in Westminster Ian Blackford called on her to resign.Mr Blackford told PMQs: “This Government is a farce, the Tory Party is in chaos and the Prime Minister is a disgrace… Prime Minister, take responsibility, do the right thing, resign.”But Mrs May sidestepped the challenge, insisting a change of Prime Minister now would mean “delaying or stopping Brexit”.The chairman of the Conservative backbench  Committee, Sir Graham Brady, told Mrs May in a phone call late on Tuesday evening that he had received the  letters of no confidence from Tory MPs required to trigger a ballot on the leadership.He announced on Wednesday morning that the vote would take place between pm and pm that day, with the result announced soon afterwards.Immediate statements of loyalty for the Prime Minister were issued by every MP in Cabinet, including several who have been touted as possible successors.By the time of PMQs at noon, the number of Tory MPs tweeting their intention to vote for the PM had passed .Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May is “the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March ”, while Home Secretary Sajid Javid said a leadership contest would be seen as “self-indulgent and wrong”.But in a joint statement, Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers, and his deputy Steve Baker said: “Theresa May’s plan would bring down the Governmentcarried forward.

Will be seen as self-indulgent and wrong. PM has my full support and is best person to ensure we leave EU on  March— Sajid JavidDecember , “A leadership election risks handing control of the Brexit negotiation to opposition MPs in Parliament,” she said.“The new leader wouldn’t have time to renegotiate a withdrawal agreement and get the legislation through Parliament by March , so one of their first acts would have to be extending or rescinding Article  – delaying or even stopping Brexit when people want us to get on with it.”A leadership election “would not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the parliamentary arithmetic”, she said.“Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart would only create more ision, just when we should be standing together to serve our country. None of that would be in the national interest.“The only people whose interests would be served are Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mrs May said she wants to focus on voters’ priorities like the economy, public services and housing, as well as delivering on the referendum vote.She said she has devoted herself “unsparingly” to delivering her agenda of “building a country that works for everyone” since becoming PM, adding: “I stand ready to finish the job.”The pound fell briefly in response to news of the challenge to Mrs May, but later rallied.Mrs May cleared the decks to lobby Tory MPs for their backing, cancelling a planned meeting of Cabinet and a trip to Dublin for talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar.The Prime Minister has my full support, not least because she has always done what she firmly believes is in the national interest. Our country needs us all to fight for a good deal and prepare for a no deal senario. All eyes and hands should be on that task.— Penny Mordaunt MPDecember , She is expected to speak with inidual Tory MPs during the day before addressing the  Committee at pm, immediately before the crucial vote.There was laughter at PMQs when she repeated the words she addresses to the Speaker each week: “Today, I will have meetings – possibly many meetings – with ministerial colleagues and others.”Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: “With only weeks left before Britain leaves the EU, Theresa May’s weakness and failure has completely immobilised the Government at this critical time for the country.“The Prime Minister’s half-baked Brexit deal does not have the backing of her Cabinet, her party, Parliament or the country.“The Conservative Party’s internal isions are putting people’s jobs and living standards at risk.”A senior Labour source made clear the party would continue to hold back on calling a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons, which could bring down the Governmentmore than half of MPs support it.“The Government has clearly lost its majority,” said the source.“It’s clear unable to negotiate a deal that can command a majority in the House of Commons or support in the country.

It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"irish employment level jumps by","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To work so hard to organise this event and support fellow kidney patients is magnicent.ldquoAll their hard work and attention to detail certainly paid off and it was wonderful to be with them on the day to help out and see this couples infectious enthusiasm in action.ldquoOn behalf of Kidney Care UK I thank them for their hard work and efforts to rally so many people to support a cause which touches the lives of so many.Thanking Stephen and Christine on behalf of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, William Johnston said: ldquoIt was lovely to get the chance to join with Stephen and Christine in the beautul setting of Castle Ward and to see their enthusiasm for supporting our cause and delivering and Organ Donation message of hope.ldquoI want to say a special word of thanks to them for really pulling out the stops to put together an amazing event to help local kidney patients and their families..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaign to clamp down on dog fouling  ","story":"LOCAL council officials have unveiled a new campaign aimed at helping rid the district of its dog fouling problem.It is a particularly contentious issue and one of the single most complained about problems in the area and, despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed and there is virtually no town or village not affected by it.This week, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has launched a new awareness campaign to remind dog owners about the importance of cleaning up after their dogs.Rolled out after a survey by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul found that levels of dog fouling had increased from the previous year, the local authority is determined to get a grip on the issue.One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.While the mindset of these particular iniduals is hard to fathom and it is concerning that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind, council officials hope the new campaign can change minds.Dog owners are being reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so is leaving them open to an pound fine.In addition, dog owners are reminded that they are responsible for training their dogs properly to lsquodo their businessrsquo in their ownerrsquos garden where it can then be collected and placed in a black bin.Politicians have become increasingly frustrated at the blatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and council officials are prepared to do all they can to tackle the problem. Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop. After his try-scoring cameo for the seconds last week, Ross Adair was added to the bench.The first half was a dour affair. Old Wesley scored an early converted try, but the lsquoHinchrsquos blanket defence was able to keep the home side at armrsquosfor the rest of the half andfour penalties from the booming left boot of Peter Nelson kept the visitors in touch.Two well struck penalties from the reliable Rory Stynes gave Old Wesley a narrow - lead at half-time.The arm wrestle continued early in the second half with another exchange of penalties making it - coming up to the hour mark.Ballynahinch were starting to dominate the physical exchanges and were rewarded with a try from replacement Adair as the game moved into the final quarter.He seems to have lost none of his electric pace following hip surgery and the coaching staff will hope to ease him back into the starting line-up as he gets more rugby under his belt.The travelling support were spared a nervy finish when front row replacement Campbell Classon went over following a sustained bout of lsquoHinch pressure on the Wesley line.Nelson completed a fine afternoonrsquos work with the boot with the conversion sealing a - victory.The rest of the results in B fell perfectly for the Co Down men and the top five teams are now separated by just two points, with Ballynahinch right in the mix for promotion once again.Old Wesley Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Daisy Lodge receives donation from Amazon Delivery Station  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE charity supporting children and young adults suffering from cancer has received a generous donation from an online delivery company giant.Daisy Lodge welcomed the pound, donation from Amazon Delivery Station and plans to use the donation to provide a child undergoing cancer treatment with short break to Daisy Lodge.Daisy Lodge provides a leline for every young person diagnosed with cancer or living with a parent with the disease during and after treatment so that no family has to face cancer alone.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery. However, thanks to the initial care of the HEMS team, the work of the Belfast Trust and follow-up surgery, Damienrsquos arm has been saved.ldquoIt has been a long journey to recovery so far, but I have been making great progress and exceeding the expectations of my medical team, Damien confirmed.ldquoEvery week there is further improvement and we are now hopeful that I will gain % mobility in my arm. I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event. We were thrilled to be able to present this to the charity.Shirley Gilliland, who owns the Carryduff firm along with her husband John added: ldquoDamien has been part of the company for over four years and as a close team we were all gutted when the accident happened.ldquoThe speed of the response of the air ambulance and the critical interventions at the scene have clearly made a dference in Damienrsquos recovery. Wersquore so grateful to have him back on the team and doing well.ldquoWhilst you take every precaution accidents can happen and we are now very much aware of the role that the air ambulance has to play in the local community, including the impact for industry related accidents.ldquoI would urge other companies to do what they can to support the service whether that is by corporate donation or fundraising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great grandmother’s pens new children’s novel  ","story":"A CLOUGH woman has just published her third childrenrsquos book in a series cleverly written to capture the imagination of young readers.Eighty six year-old Maureen Donnellyrsquoa book, Five Famous Dogs of Ireland, which is illustrated by Ulster artist Susan Hughes, looks at the wealth of legends and rich folklore which has almost been forgotten today.Mrs Donnelly, whose late husband, the Rev James Donnelly, was rector of Saul and Inch Parish Churches, says she got her inspiration from a picture of her great grandson, one year-old Rory Donnelly, holding on to a fluffy teddy bear in one hand and patting the familyrsquos pet dog with the other.She said: ldquoIt struck me when I saw the photo how well children and animals get along. Sadly, children are growing up in a society that is saturated with technology and it appears to be hindering their development in reading and understanding.Five Famous Dogs of Ireland brings to le the best loved of all the Irish hounds in history since Finn McCool and his favourite dog, Bran, strolled these parts.They include the much loved best friend of Manus OrsquoKane, an ancient chieftain from the Glens. His wolfhound was called Bawn and was known to be the best jumping dog in all of Ireland and could scare off the meanest of enemies.Mrs Donnelly said: ldquoI had the privilege to grow up with stories such as Bran. I loved the story so much I wrote it down back then. And Irsquom really glad I did. I came to write all the ones I could recall back then too. These tales will be sure to ignite again the imaginations of every child who reads them.No book would be complete without the tale of Setanta, the young boy who grew up to be a brave warrior. He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation.

He doesnrsquot hog the limelight ndash in fact quite the opposite. He stays away from it. His hero status is earned, though, his earning of the status is not a deliberate focus. That is more for others to do. If we donrsquot have heroes then where do we get our inspirations from  Often our heroes are close to home, and that is true of this one.Itrsquos early summer  and an eager  year-old is anxious to know. ldquoWell, was he there  The equally eager  year-old, deciding to be a wee bit cute, replied: ldquoWho  A few playful expletives from the  year-old and the  year-old burst out laughing: ldquoAye, he was there ndash there was no county training tonight.:It was the first Town senior training session the  year-old attended.

The Town man gave me great encouragement and told me to keep coming back to training. He is our hero. Hersquos everyonersquos hero. I will come back to our nineteen-year old later.Over  Gaels from Down, all over Ireland and beyond gathered in the Slieve Donard Hotel last Friday night to honour and to pay tribute to one of Downrsquos greatest ever footballers, none other than the great Colm McAlarney.His evening started with a knock on the door at his home in the Town when club chairman, Kevin Sweeney, and event organiser Kevan Owens surprised Colm in his kitchen with those immortal words ldquotonight Colm ndash this is your le.It was filmed and the first sign of his hero status became apparent ndash total shock and his humble disbelief. Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site.

I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

No crime was detected.Mr Jackson said: ldquoNothing in the documents, or the conclusions that they reached, wouldrsquove assisted the police in a criminal prosecution of Stephen Brimstone.Ofgem audited Mr Brimstonersquos RHI boiler and concluded he joined the scheme legitimately.Mr Beer said he would not comment on that before having time to consider it.Pressed by  memberDame Una OrsquoBrien,he suggested it may not be appropriate for the inquiry to ldquodraw broad conclusions about Ofgemrsquos ldquoattitudes and cultures on the basis ldquoof a relatively junior lawyerrsquos emailed advice in one case..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ofgem blames former Stormont department for botched energy scheme article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Craigavon Manager Jenner Fearon said: “It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position after our long association with the Citizens Advice brand. From December we will be changing our name to Community Advice Craigavon. For us it is ‘business as usual’.“We have been in talks with Advice NI since the summer and are looking forward to working with our colleagues in the independent advice sector and at Advice NI. We have already moved to a new case management system and we view this as opportunity to improve and develop. We will continue to focus on helping our clients who are experiencing increasing pressures as a result of welfare reform changes and the universal credit roll out. We are grateful for the continued support of the Department for Communities, ABC Council, the Southern Health  Social Care Trust  Macmillan Cancer Support. “We offer help with welfare benefits advice, completion of forms, advice on employment law, consumer rights, housing problems and immigration law. We also have a dedicated debt advice service, guidance on private pensions via the Pensionwise Service  tribunal representation. We have a Macmillan Benefits Service which operates out of Craigavon Hospital for clients with cancer and family members. “We have been able to set up a digital area in our Lurgan office at Mount Zion House.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
