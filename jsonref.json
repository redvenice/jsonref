He was so uncomfortable in his skin about being gay even though he said he wasn\u0027t.\u0027 Earlier this month his Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley, 56, has told how the ‘façade’ of heterosexuality was a burden on his friend as he refused to publicly reveal that he was gay, believing it would damage his career.While Michael came out to school friend Ridgeley way back in 1983, while they were shooting the music video for Club Tropicana in Ibiza, it would be 15 years before the rest of the world knew.Michael’s ‘persona which he constructed for public consumption’ didn’t give him space to ‘develop his true self’, Ridgeley wrote in his new autobiography.         Sir Elton, 72, opened up to Sharon Osbourne on her American chat show, The Talk         Sir Elton had called Sharon after George Michael died almost three years agoHe said the singer was ‘beset by confusion as a consequence of his sexuality’ and struggled to ‘define the reality beneath the public image’, causing a tension which ‘only seemed to play out more publicly later on.’‘Beyond the close inner circle nobody really had a clue, so while the reality of maintaining the façade wasn’t tearing George apart, some cracks were definitely starting to show,’ he wrote.He said that Michael’s ‘ambition to succeed had taken priority over everything else and that included his ability to openly express his sexuality.’According to Ridgeley, the pop star struggled with the public persona he created so he didn’t have to reveal his true self.‘The persona which he constructed for public consumption hadn’t left George with a lot of space in which to develop his true self behind the scenes,’ he wrote.‘He was driven by an unstoppable desire to fulfil his potential, but that had come at a price. As a young man still trying to find himself, George’s ambition to succeed had taken priority over everything else and that included his ability to openly express his sexuality.’         Sharon Osbourne spoke to Sir Elton about his close friend George He said that his decision to stay silent about his private life ‘only fed the uncertainty about his public persona.‘What the real implications were for George, I can’t say, but I knew he was never comfortable with the added interest that came with Wham! hitting the big time.’He added: ‘While on tour, working with Wham!, George was presenting a public image that didn’t come naturally to him.’He said that George was ‘adamant his sexuality should be kept under wraps’ which ‘created a whole unwelcome extra level of stress for him to manage.’He added: ‘I had certainly never met any boyfriend that George might have had while we were together as a band.‘He thought coming out would scupper chances of competing with artists like Madonna and Michael Jackson in the States.’Michael refused to come out even after his boyfriend Anselmo Feleppa died from AIDs in 1993. "},{"url":null,"title":"French bulldog gets stuck tree owner tries teach jump command","story":"               The French bulldog appears to rise to his owner\u0027s challenge with his front paws ready to leap between the branches of the tree in a park in Bulgaria (left). Leo falls short of the challenge and finds himself wedged between the tree trunk (right) In the footage, the owner tempts little Leo to jump through a gap between two branches on a tree.Holding out a treat as an incentive, the French bulldog appears keen to rise to his owner\u0027s challenge, and with his front paws leaps up the tree.Leo manages to get his top half between the branches, but quickly finds his backside wedged into the tree.

marking the 34th anniversary of the land being handed back to its aboriginal owners.The ban is a major victory for the Anangu aboriginal people, for whom the rock is a deeply sacred place and central to many cultural traditions, following decades of campaigning to have the route shut.  The Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Board announced the ban in 2017 after finding that less than 20 per cent of park visitors were climbing the rock, but since then there has been a steady uptick in visitors looking to make the trek, with Australians and Japanese being the main users.Friday saw almost unprecedented scenes as cars parked up for more than half a mile down the highway leading to the base of the climb, while observers said the rock was as busy as they\u0027d ever seen it.           The Anangu have called Uluru part of their ancestral homeland for centuries, but ownership was stripped away in 1956 after it became a National Park - before being handed back on October 26, 1985 as part of a 99-year lease         As part of the lease the Anangu were obliged to keep a climbing route open for tourists, but have asked visitors to respect their traditions by not climbing (pictured, a sign placed next to the trial by the Anangu)         The decision to end the climb was taken in 2017 after the tourist board which helps manage the rock found less than 20 per cent of visitors were making the trek, but that has prompted a steady uptick in interestThe UNESCO World Heritage-listed 348-metre (1,142-ft) monolith was named Ayers Rock by explorer William Christie Gosse after he stumbled upon it during an expedition in 1873, but has been known by the name Uluru for centuries among the Anangu.The rock is central to the creation myths of the aboriginal people, with tourists only told the start of the stories which their children would typically learn.The rest of the stories are shrouded in secrecy - some told only to women, others told only to men, as part of their coming-of-age rites, often accompanied by visits to particularly sacred parts of the rock.To respect the traditions, visitors are restricted in which parts of the rock they can visit, and are often asked not to take photos of sensitive sites, even while driving past. While Uluru was first mapped more than 100 years ago, regular visits did not begin until a dirt track was opened in the 1940s, with tours only beginning in earnest in the 1950s.In 1956 the land was removed from the control of the Anangu when it was declared a National Park, and control was handed to the Commonwealth.The move kick-started a decades-long legal fight by the aboriginal people to win back control of their ancestral land, which ended on October 26, 1985, when the territory was handed back under a 99-year lease.As part of the lease the Anangu were obliged to keep a climbing route open, but they have been campaigning to shut it ever since.Signs posted at the base of the climbing trail for years read: \u0027This is our home. Please don\u0027t climb.\u0027           A man wearing a \u0027respect\u0027 t-shirt encourages visitors not to climb Uluru on the last day before an official ban comes into place         Aboriginal people have been asking that the route be closed for years, as dozens of people have either died or been seriously hurt while making the trek, defiling their sacred site         Tourists queue up to climb the rock ahead of sunset, when the trail was shut. An official ban will come into force overnight, meaning the climb will not be opened on Saturday         Tourists line up to climb Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in the Northern Territory, Yulara         Uluru is central to the cultural traditions and creation myths of the Anangu people. Tourists are only told the stories that children would hear, while some parts of the myth are only revealed to men or women as they come of ageSonita Vinecombe, a visitor from the Australian city of Adelaide who lined up early in the morning to make the trek, said she had mixed feelings on the issue.\u0027You want to respect the cultural side of things, but still you want to have it as a challenge to get up the rock,\u0027 she told Reuters.American tourist Kathleen Kostroski said she would not climb because it would be \u0027sacrilegious\u0027 to do so.\u0027It\u0027s a violation against mother nature, first of all and secondly, against the aboriginal indigenous people here,\u0027 she said.Dozens of people have died while climbing Uluru, from falls and dehydration in the hot, dry conditions. Summer temperatures often top 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).The closure was announced two years ago when fewer than 20 percent of visitors were making the climb.To commemorate the climbing ban the park will conduct public celebrations over the weekend.It was an emotional day, said indigenous ranger Tijiangu Thomas.\u0027Happiness is the majority feeling, knowing that people are no longer going to be disrespecting the rock and the culture - and being safe.\u0027The Oct. 26 closure marks 34 years since the land was given back to the Anangu people, an important moment in the struggle by indigenous groups to retrieve their homelands.Uluru climb closed permanently as hundreds scale sacred site on final day - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)"},{"url":null,"title":"How ruthless people smugglers targeting ports English coast","story":"Share this articleLorry deaths: Smuggling is so rife there¿s a migrant minibus service, say Purfleet residents | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"WeWork chairman says employees soon laid taking one team","story":"Share this articleLeaked transcript: What WeWork’s new chairman told employees - Vox"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/27/15/49A21FB200000578-5440369-image-a-15_1519746611029.jpg","title":"Female barrister 54 TWO elderly live lovers allowed hold fortunes","story":"Share this article          Oxford University professor Christopher Gosden, son of Dr Weddell, has been told he has no valid claim on the estate of his mother, which ended up mostly going to Miss CookJudge Mark Pelling QC has now ruled that while Professor Gosden’s lawyers could have prevented the sale of his mother’s house without his knowledge, he was not due any compensation because his mother could ultimately have insisted that she wanted to sell her house and move in with her younger lover.There was no evidence she lacked the mental capacity to make rational decisions.And he said that Miss Cook’s huge inheritance from her other elderly lover, Miss Southworth, did not mean Dr Weddell could not have wanted to give her more.

He returned as a photographer to document the town’s transformationby Lindokuhle Sobekwa and Sean O’Toole“I first went because my mother used to be employed there as a domestic worker,” says photojournalist Lindokuhle Sobekwa. “When I first visited Daleside, to me it seemed an isolated place, a ghost town.”Daleside used to be a white-dominated area, but now it is mixed. In the early 2000s Sobekwa’s mother took a job as live-in help with a white family in this town south of Johannesburg. As she struggled alone to support her four children he only saw her on weekends and during school holidays.“I would visit Daleside with my brother and we would assist her with things like garden work,” says the 24-year-old Magnum nominee who grew up an hour away in the eastern Johannesburg township of Thokoza.

More than a decade later, having established himself with a remarkable photojournalism project on drug abuse in Thokoza, Sobekwa returned to Daleside.“I realised that I had built up an illusion of what I might find,” he says. “Daleside has changed since 2001. There are now black people living there, and there is also visible separation between rich and poor.”Unlike its neighbour, Henley on Klip, a swanky riverside settlement once described by an apartheid parliamentarian as “one of the most beautiful residential areas in the Transvaal”, Daleside more accurately reflects the renamed Gauteng province’s industrial character. Located next to an open-pit dolomite mine, adjacent to a busy highway connecting Johannesburg with a constellation of manufacturing towns to its south, Daleside’s inhabitants are a mix of small-scale farmers and mine workers.“Daleside is a forgotten area,” says Sobekwa. Class has complicated the region’s older racial binaries. “The rich area nearby is protected by a lot of security guards carrying guns. I tried to photograph there but was told to leave.”Photographing in Daleside proved no less difficult at first.“People still confused me for a garden worker.” Sobekwa’s camera was also a source of distrust. “There is heightened suspicion because of the killing of white farmers. They thought I might be a criminal.”Sobekwa says it was easier to work when he was with his travel companion, French photographer Cyprien Clément-Delmas.“For me, when I’m with Clément-Delmas – my white, French, collaborator – it is easier to work there. But when I’m alone – when he goes back to France – it is a bit challenging for me. I have to constantly be careful how I approach people and their personal spaces.”The pair befriended a kindly pastor at a local church to help gain the trust of Daleside’s conservative white community.Among the photos Sobekwa has produced for their work-in-progress book on Daleside are frank portraits of residents in their bedrooms. One shows an adolescent girl with ginger hair reclining on a bed with a pink crocheted bedspread. Pasted on the wall behind her are hand-drawn pictures and photos torn from magazines. “I was amazed to see posters of people she looked up to on the wall,” says Sobekwa. “This is what we do in the township.”Sobekwa met the girl’s family at the supermarket and he has often visited them. He has even been invited to stay over – a noticeably different attitude to that of some white families in the town who have refused to be photographed. There are no mixed-race couples in Daleside.“Cyprien did some interviews with the white residents by himself,” says Sobekwa. “I was so surprised at what they told him. Most of them don’t like black people. They say black people have brought crime, drugs, all the bad things.”Religion is an important facet of life in this community. Christian icons are commonplace in its homes, says Sobekwa. For the photographer this is another point of overlap with life in South Africa’s black townships. He describes the inhabitants of Daleside as being in “the same trap as poor black people” – dependent on religion at a time of worsening income disparities and economic stagnation.Sobekwa sees similarities between the challenges facing Daleside and the township of Thokoza where he grew up. “This helps me relate to them, to some extent,” he says, “but there are also differences that make it difficult for me. As an outsider, most of the time I was mistaken for someone who was looking for a job. This wouldn’t happen if I was there with Cyprien.“At times I’d also feel like I wasn’t connecting with them: for me it is important to connect with the people I photograph. I think it was because I kept being reminded that I did not belong there, even though I felt like I did because of those similarities I saw between our communities.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0f8385e421753efcece36d2c66a6785a9bc921/0_127_4612_2767/master/4612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71500187cb82888907dbe4bc03baa38e","title":"guardian editors climate emergency pledge","story":"Editors from across the  explain how they are putting the climate emergency front and centreThe climate crisis is a story that reaches every corner of the world and on the international news desk our team of correspondents report on it from around the globe.For many readers, it is something they experience to varying degrees of intensity at first hand – a hotter summer, an earlier spring, floods in autumn – but by linking up those experiences, we are able to show how interconnected this crisis is.In the past few months we have covered stories ranging from the record-breaking European heatwave, where temperatures of over 45C were recorded in France for the first time, a heatwave and drought in India, where thousands abandoned their homes, and the unprecedented Arctic wildfires that could be seen from space.Such events are not just “weather”, however, and we follow their impact: the buckling European road and rail infrastructure not suitable for the new climate era, the desperate search for water in Chennai and the Greenland residents traumatised by the climate emergency as life becomes more precarious and social problems such as alcoholism intensify.In Italy, the Planpincieux glacier in the Mont Blanc massif is changing so rapidly that avalanches and debris falls have led to deaths and evacuations, leaving residents in the town of Courmayeur fearing how much longer it will hold.Our reporters have also travelled to where governments and iniduals are making it worse. Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3858d96ea129929c09d1781ed401f522605d3b80/218_2651_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a34a700de9e45906839302b85b17e9","title":"have you spotted any new buds or flowers in october","story":"If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photosAccording to former  environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

If SUV drivers were a nation, they would rank seventh in the world for carbon emissions.“An SUV is bigger, it’s heavier, the aerodynamics are poor, so as a result you get more CO2,” said Florent Grelier from the campaign group Transport \u0026amp Environment. Grelier said the global shift towards bigger cars had been observed for a while, but the effect on emissions increases compared with other industries was surprising nonetheless.“The problem is much bigger than we expected,” he said.The global car market has been stalling in recent years, which analysts have attributed to the escalating China–US trade war and the sluggish performance of the Chinese economy in general.The SUV segment has so far bucked this trend, however, with a record 35m vehicles sold in 2018.The IEA figures show that SUVs steadily increased their share across major markets all around the world, from Europe and the US to China and India.Cozzi said this was another surprise: “We thought this was a trend that was more concentrated in a few countries … but it’s becoming really universal.”In the US, nearly one in two passenger cars sold today is an SUV.The IEA’s definition of “SUV” covers a range of cars from crossovers to off-road vehicles. Popular models in the UK include the Nissan Qashqai, Hyundai Tucson and Land Rover Range Rover.The emissions analysis considered only the carbon produced from fuel combustion, not any emissions embedded in the manufacturing of the cars – where larger models are also likely to result in more emissions.SUVs started to become popular in the 1980s, and often earned nicknames such as “Chelsea tractor” as a result of the wealthy city suburbs they became associated with. Since then, sales have continued to rise, and the vehicles are often marketed as a status symbol.Cozzi said a number of factors were driving the demand for bigger cars. While perceptions of heightened safety or increased social status could play a role at the inidual level, she also pointed towards manufacturers’ changing offering.She said the difficult market situation led carmakers to look for the most profitable models in their ranges.“There is a really big need for car manufacturers to find the margins wherever it is possible, and the SUV segment seems to be one of those places,” she said.In the UK, the transport sector overtook energy generation as the number one source of greenhouse gas emissions in 2016.According to a  analysis of Department for Transport statistics, there are about f5 million licensed SUVs in the UK today.The UK government has pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040, although hybrid models would be exempt under the plan.The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s independent adviser, says the ban should be brought forward to 2035 and include hybrid cars.This is due in part to EU emissions targets, phased in from next year, which will put much stricter limits on the average emissions of each manufacturer’s newly registered cars.Experts are stressing that quick decarbonisation of the transport sector will also require a reduction in the total number of passenger cars on the road, particularly in big cities.“We need to keep less and less space for cars so that it’s more convenient for people to use other means of transportation, whether it’s walking, cycling or public transport,” Grelier said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7953bd2ffa1276e246a4194ea706c0f21c899554/298_294_3217_1930/master/3217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cebc338604028009f3f185601e40262","title":"if harvey weinstein was testing the waters he got his toes burnt","story":"Is Weinstein so devoid of self-awareness that he didn’t suspect he’d be called out at the Actor’s Hour? Absolutely – and the crowd’s reaction exposes the iron grip of the culture of silenceIt is likely to become a drama school improv scenario for decades to come: you’re about to do your standup comedy set at an event for young actors when Harvey Weinstein walks in and sits down. What do you do? Walk out in protest? Perform a citizens’ arrest? Hide the potted plants?For better or worse, comic Kelly Bachman found herself in exactly this situation on Wednesday when Weinstein, who is out on $1m bail ahead of his impending rape trial in January, shuffled into the Actors’ Hour, a small “speakeasy” on New York’s Lower East Side. He installed himself at a table and was soon surrounded by a small entourage (described as “younger women and older men in suits”). Bachman, who was up to perform, later confessed she’d had nightmares about spotting Weinstein in her audience. But if this was some kind of audition-by-fire, she passed with flying colours.The entire episode has been well documented, but to summarise, Bachman adjusted her set on the fly to incorporate the kind of attack lines most people would only have thought of 24 hours later. She began by acknowledging “the elephant in the room”, or rather “the Freddy Kreuger” in the room. “I didn’t know we had to bring our own Mace and rape whistles to Actors’ Hour y’all,” she jokes to the small room. Incredibly, there are boos (in male voices) and a heckler tells her to shut up. “Shut up? This kills at group therapy for rape survivors,” Bachman responds, adding: “I have been raped, surprisingly by no one in this room, but I never got to confront those guys so … uh … just a general ‘fuck you’ to whoever.”During the interval, two of Bachman’s colleagues, Zoe Stuckless and Amber Rollo, approached Weinstein’s table and furiously condemned him. “I’m going to stand four feet from a fucking rapist and no one is going to say anything?” said Stuckless. They were escorted from the premises.In a later statement, Weinstein’s publicist Juda Engelmayer made out that Weinstein had been unfairly treated when he was “out with friends, enjoying the music and trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down”. She described the scene as “downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public”.That goes some way to answering the immediate question: what the hell was Weinstein thinking? Is he so devoid of shame and self-awareness that he did not consider the effect of his presence at an event filled with young, female performers? That would certainly fit the pattern, judging by the testimonies of the 80-plus women who have come forward to accuse Weinstein of ruining their lives and careers. Or was he somehow testing the waters of his current notoriety? This would seem to be a familiar phase of the #MeToo process now: witness disgraced comics Louis CK and Aziz Ansari, both of whom attempted onstage comebacks following their own admissions of sexual misconduct – comebacks that were widely judged to be premature.One thing this episode sheds light on is how Weinstein and others might have got away with their (alleged) abuses for so long. When we talk of a “culture of silence”, this public appearance was an illustration of how persistent and pervasive it still is – exacerbated by basic human decency and politeness. Many at the Actors’ Hour venue were reportedly stunned when Weinstein came in, not believing it was really him, but very few of them spoke out about it. Many involved in this incident came to Weinstein’s defence, however: the audience members who booed Bachman and told her to shut up the people sat with Weinstein, one of whom called Rollo a “cunt” when she told Weinstein he was a monster Weinstein’s publicist. A male standup also attempted to defuse Bachman’s earlier gag by saying: “I’d like to address the elephant in the room. Who in this room produced Good Will Hunting? ‘Cause that shit was great.” If this was a drama school test, that’d probably be a fail. Even Bachman herself later admitted she was under pressurenot to speak out, from herself and others, since her act was being recorded and she wanted a “good, evergreen tape” of her new material to send out to people.The venue have also had to defend their actions, or rather inactions. They claimed their goal was “to ensure that all guests are treated equally”. Unsustainable though the notion is considering the mountain of testimony against him, Weinstein is technically innocent until proven guilty. There is a “due process” argument that he will get his reckoning in court. In the meantime, we can still question just how much an accused sex criminal’s desire for “solace” should be accommodated above that of others. Some would argue free speech ultimately won the day, and if Weinstein was testing the waters, he certainly got his toes burnt.There would also be a delectable irony if the careers of Bachman, Rollo and Stuckless got a boost from this episode. Bachman already says she has had a spike in Twitter followers. They could be the first women in showbiz to come out of an encounter with Weinstein better off than they went in. That would be a turning point of sorts. But perhaps this bizarre incident also illustrates how the structures that enable male abuses of power go deeper than most of us imagined, and they still will be there after Harvey Weinstein has been dealt with. Bringing the final-level baddie of #MeToo to justice does not mean it’s game over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e7f7f14f27f0a90a4754c5b8652510dc0d2d3d9/200_422_2515_1509/master/2515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=519d2fe0d04587e2e9ffb01c82a921fa","title":"kelly bachman comedian interview confront harvey weinstein","story":"Kelly Bachman called out the mogul when he showed up at a New York performance. The public response, she said, has been ‘overwhelming’No one seemed to be acknowledging the fact that Harvey Weinstein was sitting at a private table in the back.By the time comedian Kelly Bachman took the stage at Actors Hour – a New York showcase for emerging performers – “I didn’t want to, necessarily, but I really felt like I had to say something,” she said.“I’m a comic, and it’s our job to name the elephant in the room,” she said, once she took the stage. “It’s a Freddy Krueger in the room, if you will. I didn’t realize I needed to bring my own mace and rape whistle to Actors Hour.”The comedian didn’t expect to end up at the center of a media frenzy when she confronted the disgraced producer. After a video of her calling out Weinstein went viral, she has been championed as an inspiration and a hero. In an interview with the , she says the reaction has been validating but also “overwhelming”.Bachman didn’t anticipate encountering Weinstein at the event, which bills itself as an intimate “speakeasy” for writers, directors, actors, musicians. “I really wanted to tape my new 10-minute set that night,” she said. “It felt like it was going to be a warm room.”As soon as she mentioned Weinstein, “I felt like all the air was sucked out,” she said. “It was a very cold room.”People in the audience booed and heckled as she continued, “Sorry, that killed at group therapy for rape survivors.”Warning: the below video contains strong languageThat got a few cheers. Bachman, who said she was a rape survivor herself, recently produced a show called Rape Jokes by Survivors, for which she enlisted a dozen survivors to share their stories and experiences. “Out of respect for them, and out of respect for myself, I had to say something.”More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and harassment. The producer posted $1m bail after being arrested on rape charges last year and has made few public appearances since.In a statement, Weinstein’s publicist Juda Engelmayer said: “This scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.”Weinstein has denied all accusations of non-consensual sex. Engelmayer did not immediately respond to the ’s request for comment.After confronting Weinstein, Bachman resumed her set as she’d initially planned. “People laughed at my set, and actually my set did well,” she said. “And the host came back on and he just went on with the rest of the show.”Later on, another comedian mentioned that Good Will Hunting – a Weinstein production – “was great”. Otherwise, no one else mentioned Weinstein, who was seated near the door of the basement venue, flanked by several women and two bodyguards. “Everyone was acting like it was a normal occurrence,” Bachman said.Then, at intermission, the actor Zoe Stuckless, who was in the audience, confronted Weinstein directly. “Nobody is going to say anything?” Stuckless shouted in a video they posted to their Facebook. “Nobody is really going to say anything?” they continued, pointing a finger toward Weinstein.“Because Harvey is sitting by the door, and we had to pass by him to get out of there, I felt like a lot of us didn’t feel comfortable just getting up and leaving right away,” Bachman recalled. “At intermission, it felt a bit easier to move around.”After Stuckless confronted Weinstein, and was ushered out, Amber Rollo – a comedian who performs in a band called Boys Drool with Bachman – approached the producer as well.“And then we all left,” Bachman said.That night, she kept replaying the evening’s events in her head. “I just kept thinking: I wish I’d said more, or maybe I should have said less.” Maybe she shouldn’t have continued on with her set, she thought. Maybe she should have walked out earlier.“I was kind of beating myself up about it,” she said.The next day, Bachman woke up to thousands of new followers on social media. “I just woke up to such overwhelming support and positive messages,” she said. “And for me the best part was other comedians showing their support. When a colleague is like ‘You did good,’ that’s a really big deal to me.”The comedian Nikki Glaser said she was “floored and inspired” by Bachman’s bravery. And in a post about Bachman, the comedy writer Mitra Jouhari said, “This is awesome and legit brave and you were funny while standing up to him to boot.”The Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, who has testified before Congress about her own experience surviving rape, has also defended Bachman, Rollo and Stuckless on Twitter.By the evening, Bachman said she was inundated by media requests. “It’s been overwhelming,” she said. “I mean, Good Morning America is about to be my living room.”Her phone was buzzing with notifications. “It’s a constant stream,” she said. “I haven’t really had time to process.”Rollo has echoed the sentiment. “I don’t want to talk to any more reporters right now,” she tweeted. “I’m sorry. I’m tired and I’m crashing, and the evilness of that room is setting in.”In the day and a half since the event, the venue – Downtime Bar in New York’s Lower East Side neighborhood – appears to have taken down its Facebook page after initially posting a note that appeared to refer to Stuckless as a heckler.The organizer of Actor’s Hour has also apologized for her handling of the situation. “I want to sincerely apologize to any people – male or female – who were re-traumatized, hurt, or felt disrespected this week at Actors Hour,” Alexandra Laliberte wrote in a Facebook note. “Mr Weinstein will not be attending any future Actor’s Hour events.”Bachman said she was glad she had spoken up. “I don’t think it’s always the comic’s job to make people feel comfortable,” she said. “In this situation, we pointed out that there was a monster in the room. I didn’t want people to feel comfortable with that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d671028827e5034d86ae13555bfcad45a4063e1/888_584_2803_1683/master/2803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffa2f15fe0392062d85a4fd392103d20","title":"the addams family review animation","story":"The latest incarnation of the mysterious and spooky household, from the directors of Sausage Party, is not creepy and not kooky – it’s blandLike taking a treasured pet to a taxidermist with disappointing results, the personality and spooky-ooky-ness of The Addams Family has been lost in this new outing directed by Sausage Party’s Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon – a mostly unfunny family film with depressingly bland character animation. There are plenty of references here to the earlier incarnations: Charles Addams’ original cartoons for the New Yorker, the 1960s TV series and the two movies from the 1990s. But this uncreepy and decidedly unkooky film is a letdown.It’s also a waste of a killer voice cast. Charlize Theron is matriarch Morticia Addams (animated with none of the delicious vampire sexiness Anjelica Huston brought to the role). Oscar Issac is her husband Gomez, with Chloë Grace Moretz and Stranger Things’ Finn Wolfhard playing the kids, Wednesday and Pugsley. Home is a former lunatic asylum above a New Jersey town down the hill, interior decorator and reality TV star Margaux (Allison Janney), a woman with the pep and hairdo of Dolly Parton, is building 50 new houses. When the Addamses refuse to spruce up their eyesore of a gothic pile, Margaux launches a hate campaign against them, mobilising the narrow-minded townspeople.While their parents go to war, Wednesday and Margaux’s tweenage daughter become friends. As an act of rebellion against her mother, Wednesday, nicely voiced by Moretz with a bored, been-there-killed-that drawl, connects with her inner optimist. (In one of the film’s best scenes, she comes home from the mall wearing a rainbow-coloured unicorn hair clip to Morticia’s horror: “How dare you bring that into my house!”).Everything is locked and loaded for a heartwarming finale in which outsiders and conservative locals realise that actually they have a lot in common. Without a shred of irony, the film, which is essentially about resisting the pressure to conform or change yourself, has a storyline stitched together from a dozen family films you’ve probably already seen. What’s missing is a heartbeat.• The Addams Family is released in the UK on 25 October and in Australia on 5 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4122943fcd1ed8c896302948382541dafef3160e/0_319_4857_2914/master/4857.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52f5461f357048e8dd8708a9acc65b37","title":"southampton leicester premier league match report","story":"By the time Jamie Vardy stepped up from 12 yards to add Leicester City’s ninth and put the final nail in Southampton’s coffin, the pocket of delirious travelling supporters, well on their way to revelling in a giddying record-breaking away win, were sarcastically singing for the goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to take aim from the penalty spot. The only other time a team won by such a margin in the Premier League 24 years ago, another Schmeichel was on the winning side for Manchester United. Leicester fans toasted Vardy’s hat-trick by feverishly waving white scarves bearing the name of their late owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, whose death was a year ago on Sunday, but Saints had long since raised the white flag on a deeply sobering evening.For Leicester, passage to the record books came after breezing to the biggest victory by an away team in the 131-year history of the English top flight and to second in the table. This victory takes them to 20 points from 10 games, one more than their total at this stage when they went on to win the league against all odds. For Southampton, who had Ryan Bertrand sent off 12 minutes into this non-event, this was an ordeal from start to finish. The visitors shot Saints to pieces, with Ayoze Pérez also helping himself to a hat-trick to celebrate his first goals in a Leicester shirt as Brendan Rodgers’s boisterous side cantered to an embarrassing rout that laid bare his side’s top-six credentials while exposing familiar flaws in the Southampton defence. By the time James Maddison curled a sweet free-kick beyond Angus Gunn for Leicester’s eighth, Ben Chilwell and Youri Tielemans, both of whom were irresistible throughout, had inflicted lasting damage. As Rodgers said, the relentless Harvey Barnes was unfortunate not to get on the scoresheet.By the time the fourth official Andy Madley signalled for two minutes of second-half stoppage-time, thousands of Southampton supporters had headed for the exits after enduring nothing short of an ordeal. With 18 minutes and 34 seconds on the clock here, home fans filtered out of St Mary’s safe in the knowledge the visitors were cantering to victory. The retrospective red card awarded to Bertrand, whose studs caught Pérez on the shin, did not help matters but, in truth, Southampton were playing second fiddle from the off, long before the brilliant Chilwell opened the scoring from close range.Rodgers insisted his purring side can improve and, on this evidence, that is a frightening assertion. Leicester ran riot and at times the suffering they inflicted on Southampton felt unfair. The gulf between the sides was alarming, reminiscent of a charity fundraiser whereby the scoreline is secondary. But, for Southampton, this capitulation does not only matter but it is also deeply concerning given Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side have conceded 19 goals in their past five matches and, unsurprisingly, have the worst home record in the ision. Up next? The champions. Away. Twice: first on Tuesday in the Carabao Cup and then next Saturday in the league. “Manchester City, we’re coming for you,” came the ironic chant from crestfallen supporters before the final whistle. Hasenhüttl acknowledged his side must solve their wretched home form – they have won 15 of their past 62 matches at St Mary’s – but by the time they were put out of their misery here, there was plenty more for the Austrian, forlorn in the dugout, to ponder.To say Southampton’s resistance was feeble would be pushing it. Their submission was meek. Tielemans drilled in Leicester’s second after Yan Valery inadvertently prodded the ball into his path following a trademark marauding run by Chilwell. Ninety seconds later, Leicester were wheeling away in celebration once more, with Tielemans again instrumental. Ricardo Pereira kick-started the move, which was finished by Pérez after a neat give-and-go with Tielemans. Hasenhüttl, whose grey tracksuit was drenched from the bucketing rain, could only grimace from the touchline. Valery did at least muster a Southampton shot on target after Danny Ings plucked Nathan Redmond’s pass out of the bucketing rain, before Ings sent an effort wide, but the manner of Southampton’s surrender was worrying.Things went from bad to worse when Pérez fired home unmarked at the back post, ghosting in behind Valery. Then Vardy got in on the act, bamboozling Maya Yoshida after Chilwell’s cross deflected into his path. The visitors, and Barnes especially, were toying with a brittle defence. Southampton kept a clean sheet for the first 12 minutes of the second half but then Gunn’s net was bulging once more. Pérez completed his hat-trick as he established a gaping hole between Kevin Danso and Yoshida and duly chested a flighted Barnes ball down before applying a thumping finish. Two minutes later, Gunn was fishing the ball out of his net again, with Vardy the culprit. The away end craved eight but got nine, by which point Southampton were broken."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dd0d1a8c0802669a8c610963a8084855af835ee/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=489fde48183c32198c124f9cae44bf89","title":"jadon sancho borussia dortmund","story":"“Whom the gods wish to destroy they first call promising.” Good news, then, for Jadon Sancho, who seems at every step of his footballing life to have skipped the age of promise and gone straight on to the role of luminous, fully realised talent.The kind of promise Cyril Connolly’s famous dictum had in mind was fragile literary talent, specifically his own crushing failure, despite having, like, done really well at Eton, to write a literary classic … a failure Connolly later turned to success, with a very English sense of charm-laden irony, by writing about it at great length in Enemies of Promise.With this in mind it seems likely Sancho will not have to worry much about Connolly’s main Enemies. The pram in the hall is not really an issue when the hall is a marbled ante-chamber staffed with basking trophy nannies.Similarly the urge to take on hack journalism work is unlikely to become a distraction, tempting though it must be for young Jadon as he glances up at the haggard, gimlet-eyed human material of the press box. As for the negative effects of earning too much money too young, well, that is pretty much the whole point around here.Football and promise: it has become a violently altered landscape in recent times and a relationship Sancho understands, as an insider, as well as anyone else.Promise is a hard commodity now. It comes with a set of numbers attached.Promise can be worth more than tangible achievement, the ability to convince one of Europe’s superclubs you might become a great footballer of greater life-changing value than actually being a great footballer, a principle otherwise known as the Dembélé Paradox. In that sense Sancho is already there, or almost there. Almost being the key point, as far as Borussia Dortmund are concerned. It is worth keeping this in mind as the most promising of England’s current crop of teenage footballers hits his first little note of turbulence.Sancho played as well as anyone in Dortmund’s defeat against Internazionale in Milan on Wednesday. More significantly he was dropped for the big game with Borussia Mönchengladbach last weekend after returning late from England duty, a punishment that came with a fine and a public slap down from Michael Zorc, the sporting director.There has been some vague talk since of other incidents, of Sancho needing to be reined in, grounded, paternally realigned. It feels like a story we have heard before. Youth, talent, fame, the empowered teenager. The sage but stern Bundesliga overlord.Or perhaps not. Sancho is 19. On the Monday he was part of an England team racially abused in Sofia, a traumatic experience even for those watching from the sidelines. He came back late and missed training.By Saturday he was being publicly called out by his manager and then by the club. The same Sancho who rushed back after his grandmother’s death last year, refused the offer of a rest, scored in the derby and was praised unconditionally for his above-and-beyond mentality. Does this seem fair and reasonable? Is it meant to?But then the idea of Dortmund as a kind of safe space, all soft edges and warm milk, Charles Xavier’s school for gifted youths, has always been a slight stretch. This is a clearing house based on glossing and selling promise. A sustained spell of form from a retail-friendly teenager: this is everything, this is the business plan. Zorc may be a serious football operator, appearing in public with an air of handsomely styled destiny about him, like a four-star general in charge of the human response to the alien fleet invasion. But he is also a salesman and like any good salesman he is always, always closing.And now he is talking about Sancho, for obvious reasons. Dortmund have made £400m over 10 years just from selling players to Barcelona, Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Chelsea and PSG. Sancho is the next idend. He has at most a single season left to run. But this needs to be done right and there have been some problems.“Sancho reminds me of Ousmane Dembélé,” Zorc has said. And why not plug that sales line? The Dembélé deal was a one-man five-year profit margin, success so brilliant it was almost too much, enough to knock the whole process out of whack. Dembélé’s problems at Barcelona have been a blemish on the record, a reputation issue, a reminder, if you look closely, that very few of these refined, BVB-issue youngsters have gone on to flourish unconditionally.Sancho has been better than Dembélé at Dortmund, has scored more goals, made more goals and done it two years younger. But he has been overplayed too, in a way that goes outside the finishing school narrative, first in the hope Dortmund might have won the league and now by a manager under pressure.Sancho played more games than Wayne Rooney at the same age. Sancho played more games than Lionel Messi in his equivalent season – and Messi, the genius-level 18-year-old was a genuine face-melting Ark of the Covenant temptation. Just before his late return from England duty Sancho had played 10 games in five weeks, the last of which ended with him on the wing close to midnight being abused by tinpot black shirts.This is a teenager pushed until he makes a mistake, then solemnly disciplined by corporate handlers with a heavy commercial investment in his success. At the end of which he still holds the cards. Sancho would be a transformative signing for Manchester United. He would be perfect as another ravenous high-grade component in the Liverpool frontline. Monetising promise. This is the game now a game Sancho is, for all the noise, still best-placed to win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e262d6307ce5f30daf7642a24202023719a52a9f/0_112_3238_1943/master/3238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=089b5f464a916aefd1eab44966b92238","title":"southampton leicester city premier league live","story":"Jamie Vardy and Ayoze Pérez both scored hat-tricks on a miserable night for 10-man Southampton, who suffered the worst ever home defeat in the top flightThat’s it for me, I’m off.

One of his passes tonight was sublime. Kasper is really happy, the only other goalkeeper to have a ‘niner’ was his father!This is an education, some of our players like James Maddison and Ben Chilwell have a lovely arrogance. Southampton fans, you can relive tonight’s game all over again.Look who is piping up.Looking forward to Ralph Hasenhüttl’s post-match interview. “We know that when teams have 10 men that is can be difficult, but we caused them a few problems tonight.”Southampton drop into the bottom three, unsurprisingly because of goal difference. Leicester are second, on 20 points, which is a better total at this stage of the season then they had when they won the league. This was the joint-biggest win in the Premier League (and a Schmeichel was present for both of them). The biggest ever top-flight away victory. Leicester played some sublime football tonight – Harvey Barnes, Jamie Vardy, Ayoze Perez and Ben Chilwell were outstanding, but we must emphasise just how bad Southampton were. Again, it is worth remembering that they were only one man down.

Blow up, ref. 88 min: “I was struggling with whether or not to start Chilwell in my fantasy team - he hasn’t done much of late - and I finally decided to go with him. Thank the lord,” writes Ryan Barnes. I was going to mention Chilwell, who is a very good left back and has two assists and a goal tonight. His biggest strength, rather than being really quick or good in the air, or anything like that, is his intelligence. He’s dependable at the back, makes sensible decisions and going forward combines really nicely with the left winger, which was Harvey Barnes tonight. I don’t think he’s going to lead England to World Cup glory any time soon, he’s not world class, but not a million miles off. He’s a bit like Leighton Baines in that regard. Vardy wins a free-kick on the edge of the box. It’s 20 yards from goal, front-centre. Maddison is over the ball … which he curls beautifully over the wall into the corner! Textbook, that is. Gunn never stood a chance, it was hit with just pace and spin. 85 min: Somebody in the office has just admitted that they’ve got Angus Gunn in their fantasy team. 84 min: If Leicester can cling onto this result, they will go above Manchester City into second place in the table.

He has seen better days. 79 min: Gray fires in a wonderful cross across the face of goal, but Stephens does well to hook it clear. 77 min: Southampton finally show a little bit of quality on the ball, their home fans jeering them ironically as they string maybe eight or nine passes together.74 min: Golden chance for Perez to score his fourth! A corner is whipped in from the left, Perez kills it stone dead on the byline beyond the far post and rolls a crossshot across the goal-line, the ball just missing the far post and the foot of Jonny Evans, who had a tap in, but didn’t quite anticipate it correctly. And with that, Perez’s work is done for the ebening. Three goals, his first in Leicester blue. He’ll be replaced by Demarai Gray.73 min: Worth remembering that Southampton’s next two games are:Manchester City (away) in the league cup. Manchester City (away) in the league. Crumbs. 71 min: Leicester make their first change: Barnes off, Albrighton on. No Leicester player will want to come off. 69 min: Redmond forces Schmeichel into a very good save! The Southampton man darts down the left, skips inside Evans and curls one towards the top corner. Schmeichel sticks out a left hand and turns it over with his fingertips. Corner to Southampton, which comes to nothing.64 min: This would be the joint-largest away win ever in the Premier League, behind Manchester United’s 8-1 win over Nottingham Forest in 1999.62 min: “I’ve lost faith with Ralph,” emails Andrew Read. “There are no words.”I wonder, despite all the good work that Hasenhüttl has done since he arrived, if this one result could spell the end. In the wrong light, it could be seen that he has lost the dressing room, or that he is tactically inept. I don’t actually believe that, but there will be lots of angry fans (and board members) to deal with in the coming days. 60 min: Leicester fans, with their scarfs in the air bearing the name of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, sing a song dedicated to their late chairman. They are having the night of their lives. It’s worth bearing in mind that Southampton are only one man down. They are playing like they have two legs. Leicester bomb forward and no Southampton players track their man. What that means is that Chilwell ends up on the byline, has time to get his head up, dinks a cross into the box, and Vardy has a free header, six yards out. No problem.Leicester are playing simple, patient football. It would be easy in this situation to bring out the tricks and flicks. But they simply work the ball around, waiting for the space to inevitably open up. When it does, Barnes drops an inch-perfect pass onto Perez’s chest. The Spaniard controls it and lashes a volley past Gunn from close range. His third of the evening.54 min: Fair play to Southampton fans, or what is left of them. They are belting out “When the Saints go marching in,”52 min: Southampton have finally caved to having just two banks of four, with Nathan Redmond scurrying around up top. I forgot to mention there were a couple of subs made by Saints at the break. Ings and Vestergaard off, Stephens and Danso on. 50 min: “There’s a fair chance Angus Gunn could well emulate his father, Bryan and set a top flight record unlikely to be broken,” moots Phil Withall. “A father and son that both concede seven goals in a Premier league match. Bryan having done so against Blackburn a long time ago …”Oh, you mean this game? As a Rovers fan, I don’t mind giving the highlights a spin again, with the game also played in a torrential downpour. Watch out for a delicious dinkchip from a young Alan Shearer. Woof. 47 min: So nearly 6-0. Yoshida gets awfully lucky after he has his pocket picked by Vardy, with the England striker only firing his shot straight at Gunn. Not sure the half-time team talk has quite gone in for the Japanese. Peeeeeeeeeeeeep! And we’re off again. It’s time for 10-man Southampton to pull off the greatest comeback of all time. Stay tuned.“Ralph Hasenhüttl should go full John Sitton at half-time,” writes Andrew Goudie. “I can’t see it, somehow.”Na, me neither. This is the first time that Leicester have scored five league goals away from home in the league since 1984, when they beat Notts County 5-2 in the Old Division 1. “There are no easy games in the Premier League,” smirks Matt Dony. “Unless you’re playing a dispirited 10 men in biblical rain. 0-8 prediction.”Looking forward to the attendance announcement at half-time. Wonder if it is real time. I wonder what Ralph Hasenhüttl is going to say to his team. Clinical from Vardy, who wasn’t going to miss out on this goal-fest. Chilwell’s cross is deflected over Vestergaard. Vardy takes it down with one touch, skins Yoshida with the other and lashes it past Gunn with a third from eight yards out. Eeeeeesh. 43 min: Barnes, now playing centrally, skips past two defenders to the byline where his shot is blocked. But the man is playing out of his rain-soaked skin.The Olés are coming out from the Leicester fans, by the way. 40 min: “I’d give credit to those fans that showed up for the start in that weather,” emails Scott Wedel. “The fans that are leaving are showing more common sense than disloyalty to the home team.”I wonder how many of them will stick around for the second half. This is a simple goal. Leicester work the ball from right to left, Chilwell crosses to the back post, Valery (now playing at left back in stead of Bertrand) completely switches off and lets the ball run, and Perez steals in to sidefoot the cross into the roof of Gunn’s net. Absolutely miserable defending from Valery, who has had a shocking half. 34 min: “I’m obviously in a minority because I didn’t think Bertrand’s challenge was worth a red card,” emails Graham Parley. “Nor did Andre Marriner at first viewing. So why didn’t he review the tackle on the pitch-side TV rather than accept the judgement of Mike VAR Dean? Is it because no ref has used it all season?”I think in that instance, it was because it was just so clear. Bertrand’s studs clearly connected with Perez’s half. With a bit more force, it could have done some serious damage. I also think that’s why they showed it on the big screen at the stadium. Because they were in little doubt it was the right decision. A clear and obvious error that should be over-ruled. And guess what, it was Mike Dean, tonight’ VAR, that did the deed.

We had been running a pub in Hertfordshire and looking for an opportunity to return to our Welsh roots the Skirrid offered that. With its reputation for paranormal activity, it couldn’t have been more different from the beautiful thatched pub we were leaving but I love places full of history and intrigue. I enjoy horror films, too.Walk in and it’s like entering a castle, with stone-flagged floors everywhere. It’s said there was a building here as early as 1110 and, though it’s impossible to verify, we do claim to be the oldest pub in Wales – most of the main bar dates from the Tudor period, and upstairs, where our guests stay, was a courtroom until Cromwell’s time. Many of the alleged ghosts are connected to that room. Local legend has it that George Jeffreys, the notorious 17th-century “hanging judge”, may have heard cases here, and that 182 people have been executed in the building. We keep a noose on the staircase, hanging from the beam that was supposedly used it has score marks on it said to have been caused by the weight of hanging bodies.Though I’m sceptical about these stories, during the 14 years we’ve been here, I’ve experienced my fair share of unexplained phenomena. On our first night at the inn, before we’d even taken over, we were sleeping in a big four-poster bed when Sharon complained of something tugging on her leg. It happened several times during the night and we had to keep turning the lights on. Of course, there was nothing there, but we barely slept. Later, we learned that relatives of people who were slow to die during a hanging would yank on their loved ones’ legs to end their suffering. I was quite shaken by that.Not long after that, my young grandson went to the toilet and came back complaining, “The man in the long dress won’t let me in!” There was no one else in the place at the time – even Sharon was out. Brave man that I am, I made him hang on until she came back.I’ve only once seen a full figure – a coachman-like character in a tricorn hat, standing in the porch in broad daylight. He caught my eye for a second or two, then was gone. That was about eight years ago and since then I’ve sometimes thought, “Did I really see that?” Obviously it would be great for business if I kept coming out with these stories, but I do question everything.The pub attracts a lot of psychics, paranormal investigators and TV crews. I’ve seen a few dodgy spiritualists over the years, but the ones who genuinely seem to believe in what they’re doing and don’t take themselves too seriously are always welcome. Our bar regulars get on well with the visitors – they love showing them around and telling their own uncanny stories. Most of the staff have had strange encounters, too – we’ve had glasses and customers’ change flying off the bar, unexplained cold spots in rooms, and one young woman who said an unseen presence whispered, then roared in her ear.Our best-known former resident is an 18th-century barmaid called Fanny Price, who died of consumption and is buried in the local churchyard. She has been spotted frequently and people often say they can smell lavender just before she appears. There have been more troubling manifestations – on half a dozen occasions, guests have shown me strange marks that have appeared around their necks – but there’s only been one instance of outright malevolence that I’m aware of. A woman came running down from one of the bedrooms, hair wet and dressed only in a coat, saying, “She tried to kill me!” Apparently she’d been in the bath and something had held her down under the water. I thought it was interesting that she said “she” rather than “he” or “it”, but she didn’t stick around to explain and I’ve been unable to contact her since.Sceptical as I am, I don’t take any chances and I do maintain the local tradition of every night putting out the Pwcca Cup, a special tankard filled with ale to appease the devil. On a windy night this time of year, when I go outside and the pub sign is swinging and the wind’s howling, I do look over my shoulder. One day I’m going to turn round and something’s going to be there. I think it will be the end of me. Especially if it’s a clown. They scare me to death.  • As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

But can you have too much of a good thing?It started during the 1999 eclipse. The year before, I had run away to Devon. Lots of bad things had happened there, but the main one was that I’d got fat. On my 27th birthday, I was 5ft 6in and weighed a hefty (as I bizarrely thought then) 9st 2lb. Worse: according to every news story I read, I was going to get an incurable disease and die. The most likely cause would be food mad cow disease hadn’t gone away, and then there were pesticides and insecticides and growth hormones. When a friend told me he’d heard organic diets were cancer-preventing, I was in. As the skies darkened on 11 August, and birds began their evening song hours too early, I pledged that if I survived the solar eclipse, I would eat only organic food. I would stay healthy, and I would not die.When organic food didn’t make my life perfect, I tried food combining (no protein with carbs). Then veganism. For 20 years now, I have cycled between diets and diet books, in search of the perfect hack for a good life: great health, better skin, the optimum weight and all, of course, with minimal impact on the environment. (Like so many women who dedicate their eating disorders to saving the planet, I need what I eat to be in some way an ethical choice.) I have been a vegetarian, a meat eater I have gone paleo, keto, macrobiotic, pegan (look it up).I am a novelist, but diet books are my embarrassing comfort read. I read them when I am bored, stressed, on a late train, facing a deadline. Recently I realised that I use them like porn, reading my favourites over and over again. As with porn, I quickly discovered a “type” of narrative that works best. Perhaps my ur-diet book is Robb Wolf’s The Paleo Solution, which begins with the author’s mysteriously sick parents, then describes how his own long period of vegetarianism left him almost dead at the age of 28, mainly as a consequence of his undiagnosed coeliac disease. Wolf began his new life with meat and a salad, and never looked back: “I was warmly satisfied, clear headed and I felt better than I had in years. After one meal.” I have read this passage over and over again, particularly when I am having a vegan crisis and need an excuse to try something else.“Is it weird that I love diet books?” I sometimes ask people, experimentally. But no one else seems to have my problem, even though everyone is now an expert on diet. While most people take it all with a pinch of salt (not so bad for your blood pressure, it turns out), I take it all very, very seriously. I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to eat without a precise set of instructions. One major joy of my diet books is feeling that I belong, that I am part of a belief system, a member of a team. But the downside is, this stuff can send you nuts (which have more carbs than you’d think, but are a good source of selenium and fibre).Most of the time, this obsession is fine. And then there are the dark times when I suddenly have to hard-delete every paleo book from my Kindle, only to buy them all again the next day. Or when I go through my Ocado favourites and remove anything not strictly vegan and spend hours creating the “perfect” clean order, only to then cancel the whole thing in the nick of time, just before it leaves the warehouse.When I am busy with my writing, happy and distracted by life, I can stay on a mild version of one of my regimes for a few months. But when stressed, I start cycling through the possibilities like an anxious lab rat trying every door to find the one that leads out. I still want so badly to get it right. I want people to stop me in the street and say, “But you look amazing! And you seem so very, very healthy. What’s your secret?” I know a lot about every single possible answer. But at my worst moments, I have forced myself to believe in completely different paradigms, sometimes all in one day. Not so much believing six impossible things before breakfast as believing six impossible things about breakfast. Could I be a spiritual person while eating meat? Is our time on Earth supposed to be about kindness and the veneration of life, or is it better to accept the natural cycle: that we eat animals and are then returned into the earth to feed them? Was everything I ate in some way wrong?As a fiction writer, it’s my job to wonder about, and dramatise, such things. But that drama has filtered through my life. During a pegan episode, I ended up hungry at a pasta restaurant with a limited menu. After one bowl of pasta and a dessert (well, why not?), I had a terrible panic attack. For countless hours I lay in bed sweating and hardly able to breathe, believing that gluten was attacking my insides, that I would develop an autoimmune disease, schizophrenia and lupus. At other times, I ate meat and fixated on the rotting corpse in my stomach, desperately wanting it out.The term “orthorexia” was coined in 1997 by Dr Steven Bratman, author of the leading book on the subject, Health Food Junkies. I don’t have that book any longer: I Marie Kondo-ed it after it calmly told me that it was possible to die from orthorexia. This did not bring me joy. But it also confirmed that I had been suffering from it for several years. Despite increasing awareness, orthorexia is not listed in the International Classification of Diseases, or in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, it has made its way into the Oxford English Dictionary, and is increasingly ingrained in our culture.Orthorexia is an obsession with “pure” or “healthy” food. It is treated as a type of anorexia because sufferers typically reduce their food intake over a period of time, often becoming raw-foodists, “juicearians” or even “sproutarians”. But it doesn’t have to be like that. Sufferers may appear to friends as simply “a bit fussy” or, like me, as “health-conscious”. And suffering inside doesn’t always show. A friend recently asked me if I (like her) felt like an impostor because I don’t look like someone who has an eating disorder. I knew what she meant. The standard eating disorder recovery “look” on Instagram is willowy and tragic, and I am a size 12-14.In many ways, I don’t even stand out among the people I know. I have two close friends who struggle with irritable bowel syndrome. In the last two years, one went to a kinesiologist (they are the ones who make you hold a food item if you feel weak, you are allergic to it), while the other had parasitic hookworms injected into her arm. Another close friend is low-carbing to combat her polycystic ovary syndrome, and another is on keto for his arthritis. We have all become persuaded we can self-medicate through food, and maybe this is even true. My friends are all neurotic, but they glow with health.Whenever I sit down for dinner with my editor, we compare regimes. “Land animals,” he said last time, explaining what was taboo for him at that moment. “And dairy.” Another friend moves between low-GI, low-carb and fasting. We have both been doing 16:8, where you fast for 16 hours of every 24, for ages. We send each other pictures of sticks we have peed on to see if we are in ketosis, the point at which the body starts breaking fat down. Another friend is on the warrior diet, which involves eating one big meal a day. We all have proper jobs in health, publishing or the arts.When I tell people I am recovering from an eating disorder called orthorexia, they usually mishear it as “authorexia”, and perhaps, for me, that’s what it is: an eating disorder based around storytelling. An eating disorder for authors, or at least encouraged by them. One macrobiotic writer suggests listening to Shakespeare if you have heart trouble, because the iambic pentameter will stabilise you. When it comes to the diet books, the different regimes, it is always the stories that do it: the familiar, comforting narrative arc of the lost soul who discovers the secret that leads to health, purity and beauty. The brave, bold young American who finds the truth that eluded his parents. The fat-adapted ultramarathon runners who do it all on a spoonful of coconut oil. After my 1999 solar eclipse weight crisis, I bought two books about food combining in a Dartmouth bookshop. Before that, I’d rarely seen a diet book. When I was growing up, our house was full of books, but not that kind. After all, wasn’t dieting one of those twee things oppressed women did in the 50s because the patriarchy said they should?The food-combining books didn’t just tell me not to eat protein and carbs together, advice I have tried to follow ever since (I still feel guilty when I fail). They told me what would happen if I did: along with indigestion and arthritis, I might get candida, anxiety, depression, IBS and chronic fatigue. One chapter was titled How Toxic Are You? The symptoms included being bored, tired, having aches and pains, few ideas and poor concentration. This was me! (And, of course, every writer I knew.) How lucky I’d found these books before I died of literally everything. But there were the success stories, too, and these became what I craved. Stories of people being brought back from the brink, people who had almost died and then been cured by avocado cream.I bought more books, which could be unintentionally funny, too. One favourite talked knowledgably about the behaviour of animals in the wild. “When that lion ate the zebra, it wasn’t having a baked potato with it,” it pointed out. But, of course, I was not a lion. I was following all the instructions, but not losing any weight. In fact, I was putting weight on.If I was not a lion, I wondered, what was I? A caveperson, came back the answer. A human with a genetic code that has not fundamentally changed for 10,000 years and whose system simply cannot compute “Haribo” or “bagel”. At first I ruled out “ancestral” diets because of all the meat, but Rose Elliot’s vegetarian low-carb book became the gateway that culminated a couple of years later in Wolf’s Paleo Solution. There were heady days of fried halloumi and eggs and mushrooms in butter, bowls of berries and cream. I loved the food, and most of my How Toxic Are You? symptoms went. I stopped feeling nervous all the time. But I didn’t lose any weight, so I went vegan again.For the next few years I swung between extremes so frequently that from a distance I might have appeared moderate. My weight increased until it hit 11st (70kg), and then refused to budge. On the outside I looked like a M-L person, a Topshop size 14, able to fit into 30in-waist jeans from anywhere but All Saints. Inside, I was suffering all the time. Pictures taken at literary festivals showed me with a double chin and flabby arms, looming over a lectern like Jabba the Hutt. Me! In my head I still looked like Kate Moss in the 90s.I started looking for clues about what other women ate: the ones who still have flat stomachs in their 40s, who still look like pictures in magazines and who don’t seem to use three filters at once on Instagram (like I do). I am ashamed to say that when I spotted Arundhati Roy looking glowing in a hotel restaurant at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, I watched to see what she ate, and was disappointed by a cappuccino. (But was it soya, almond or cow’s milk?) Enabled by a world that is still fixated on women’s bodies, on slow days I would do online research to determine which of my regimes actually worked on other people. The fact that they’d failed to work on me was my fault, not the fault of the diet, of course.Had they failed? Perhaps I sound mentally unstable, but physically I am as strong as an ox. Whenever I am ill – which, perhaps due to all the kale and vitamins, is very rarely – I think back to the last thing I ate and blame it on that. But could it be that these “healthy” diets actually work? Maybe I am meant to be a size 12-14 person who gets one (if that) cold a year. Of course I am constantly on guard against any sort of illness, ready at all times with my turmeric and green tea and manuka honey. And I don’t want to admit I feel healthy in case I tempt fate and am diagnosed with an incurable disease.I’d love to say that all this is in the past, but it is unlikely I will ever be able to get out of my head all the stories I believe about food and illness. In that sense, I’ll be authorexic for ever, even if at times I have got my orthorexia more or less under control. I spend most of my time now on a lowish carb diet simply because it makes me feel better mentally and comes with less plastic packaging, and I’ve almost, but not quite, come to terms with my size and shape. But I can still be easily triggered: a column on being vegan for the environment can turn me for a week or two coverage of the health benefits of Tom Watson’s keto diet will exert an influence. If I had seen Roy’s breakfast, I would have adopted it.Meanwhile, my Instagram heaves with body positivity. I love Lizzo and Ashley Graham, and all the many muscly heroines of CrossFit. But they are young and beautiful, and I am 47. They are naturally glorious, while I still need help. I just don’t have that jawline – though a part of me thinks that there is a diet to fix that. One of my favourite new books is about intuitive eating, where you eat what you want (yes, including Big Macs and Twirls) on the basis that your body will eventually ask only for what it needs. As one of my friends despairingly asked, “How is that even possible?”Last week I was in the supermarket trying to decide between organic brazil nuts and nonorganic pistachio nuts (this is close to my natural state) when I became aware of two teenage girls in the same aisle. They were browsing the “Free From” foods. They looked perfectly healthy and robust: everything you should be at 15. They were surrounded, as I was, by abundance: cheap, plentiful food. “Let’s get some gluten-free stuff,” one said to the other. “Apparently it helps you lose weight.” I wanted to interrupt, to say something to them, but what? That it’s not true, and all that gluten-free stuff is just full of sugar? That they really don’t need to lose any weight? What would I have told my younger self, before I embarked on my orthorexic journey? I don’t honestly know. So I chose the brazil nuts and left, hoping they would simply grow out of it, but knowing, given the size and power of the wellness industry, with all its compelling stories, that they probably won’t.• Oligarchy, a novel by Scarlett Thomas, is published on 7 November (Canongate, £14.99).

I am developing deep feelings for him, but have an inkling that he is a sexually repressed homosexual. I do not want to end up falling in love with him, marrying – having children – only to find out that, although he may have loved me, we never truly shared a sexual attraction.Despite his tender and affectionate nature, I have never felt him to be sexually attracted to me. I often initiate sex (and am often ignored). In previous relationships, I have found myself fending off consistent unwanted advances, and any move on my part would have been taken up. When we do have sex he turns the lights off, and it’s always just before we go to sleep. When I raised the idea that he might not be sexually attracted to me, he flipped out, saying I lacked tact. He mentioned early on that he separates “sexual desire” or “sex” from “emotional connection”, which left me aghast: the feeling of being in love, for me, is deeply bound up with sexual and emotional intimacy. I am very troubled and need to know if he wants me.You have a hunch that something isn’t right, and that’s worth listening to: if you don’t feel desired in a sexual relationship it can be utterly demoralising (I get dozens of letters about this every week), and there’s no reason to put up with this if that’s what is happening, or if this is how the relationship makes you feel.However, before you do anything drastic, you may want to look at things a bit differently. I wonder where you learned that a man “wanting you” was defined by “consistent and often unwanted” advances rather than the “tender, affectionate and caring” man you are with at the moment? I consulted Murray Blacket, a sexual and relationship psychotherapist (cosrt.org.uk). “Your fear is that J doesn’t find you sexually attractive, and your defence is that loads of other men have, so you look for suggestions as to why that might be true: ie, he must be gay,” he said. “But people often make a judgment – ‘My boyfriend doesn’t fancy me, therefore he must be gay’ – instead of addressing the more difficult question of what’s going on in their sex life.”J may be gay, but Blacket put forward some other theories based on experiences with his patients. “J may be less sexually experienced than you – or the men you are used to. He may be shy, lacking in confidence or experience or you may have mismatched libidoes, or ways of initiating sex. If in response, you are asking J: ‘Are you gay?’ or ‘Why don’t you fancy me?’ in response, that would feel like an attack for any man – but especially if he’s lacking in experience and already nervous.”Equally, if J isn’t making advances towards you in the way you’d like then, naturally enough, you are going to have questions about yourself.So, what do you do? You may feel it’s too much to go and see a relationship therapist at this stage, but if you’re serious about this man you do need to find a way for you both to be able to communicate. The longer I do this job, the more I see sex as just another form of communication, and the lack of it as a breakdown in communication between a couple. It’s rare to find a couple who can’t communicate, but have great sex.Blacket said that “although you may not be asking questions of J in the right way, they are good questions”. He suggested “not doing what I often see happen, which is that one person is unhappy and so they say to their partner, ‘You need to go and get this seen to.’”You both need to take responsibility for your part in it. Putting him on the defensive isn’t going to make him feel great. Remember: there are two of you in this relationship.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

I suppose if there’s anyone you can’t condemn for pontificating like this, it’s the pontiff. Yet his advice annoyed me, as did some newly published tips aimed at scientists from the novelist Cormac McCarthy, who turns out to have been giving behind-the-scenes editorial advice to leading researchers for years. “Remove extra words or commas whenever you can,” reads McCarthy’s advice (as paraphrased by two of his academic collaborators). Also: “Don’t overelaborate.” Though he’s less of a stickler than Francis when it comes to adjectives: “Only use an adjective if it’s relevant.” In short, we’re back to William Strunk and EB White’s famous advice in The Elements Of Style: “Omit needless words.”My issue with all this isn’t the fact that you can – who’d have guessed it? – find plenty of adjectives and adverbs in the pope’s own writing. Nor is it that McCarthy’s admonition against overelaboration is redundant. (Of course you shouldn’t overelaborate that’s why they call it overelaboration.) As the linguist Geoff Pullum notes, “omit needless words” is a bit suspect, too, since clearly you shouldn’t omit needful words, so the word “needless” is itself needless. So “omit words” might make more sense, except that it’s stupid. No, my issue with all this advice to eliminate unnecessary verbiage is: unnecessary for what? Claims of necessity or superfluity imply some end goal, but it’s rare to see one explicitly stated.After all, the complex scientific jargon that McCarthy disdains isn’t usually there, I’d argue, because the authors knew no better it’s because their goal isn’t solely to communicate, but also to signal their knowledge and qualifications. (This is a bad goal to aim for, I’d say. But so long as academics have powerful incentives to do so, style advice won’t solve things.)Meanwhile, a talented novelist can harness verbosity to good communicative ends. How many of the words in Lucy Ellman’s new 1,000-page novel Ducks, Newburyport are needful? For that matter, how many novels are needful at all? How many of the words ever written truly had to be written, other than signs saying things like “Dangerous cliff edge, keep away”, or “Warning: contains bleach”?In any case, my hunch is that verbosity of the bad kind rarely arises because the writer hasn’t yet been told, whether by popes or novelists, to cut it out. Rather, it arises when you haven’t properly figured out what it is you’re trying to say. Whenever I’m stuck on how to express something – or I read my writing back, and have the feeling that it’s missing the point – the problem is never one of style. It’s that I haven’t clarified exactly what that point is, and that I’ve been engaged in a subconscious effort to avoid having to do so.So instead of “omit needless words”, try “invest needful effort”. Make yourself do the job of pinpointing your message, in your own mind, and the writing will come easily. I mean, it probably will. Unlike some, I wouldn’t claim to be infallible. Steven Pinker’s book The Sense Of Style draws on evolutionary theory to show you how to tailor your language to our millennia-old brains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbda5ec0a3ee7ccc75f81fe26aef5fdea7b493c3/0_47_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f7c34d066e6ebd15dd680d5d02d42ac","title":"fox news watching what i learned","story":"As a media critic, I’ve had an intimate look at the channel’s morning show – and how it poisons the national conversation“Everything should calm down a little bit in seven months,” they said. It was 9 February 2016, when I began my career as a critic of Fox News at Media Matters for America, a not-for-profit progressive research center dedicated to monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the US media.Most people, eventually including Donald Trump, assumed Hillary Clinton would be elected the 45th president of the United States that November. Most people were wrong about a lot of things.Nearly four years later, the US political world revolves around the tweets of an erratic Fox News-watching grandpa who just so happens to run the most powerful country on Earth. Like any avid TV viewer, Trump has his favorite stories, and few rival the morning show Fox \u0026amp Friends, where he spent years making frequent appearances before ing into politics.Since July 2018, I’ve been one among a lucky few live-tweeting the show along with the president. And after consuming thousands of hours of Rupert Murdoch’s finest drivel, I’ve learned a few things about how America’s No 1 news network is dragging the United States into ruin.Fox \u0026amp Friends’ main hosts – Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade – are a consistent train wreck of shameless hackery, even managing to turn a report about Trump’s $1bn in business losses into a glowing endorsement of his bold, wealthy brilliance.Officially, Fox \u0026amp Friends is an opinion show, but the ostensibly separate news side – which also lies daily – pops up a lot.Ed Henry’s role in the news ision is chief national correspondent, but in the opinion ision he’s a co-host of the weekend edition of Fox \u0026amp Friends and occasional guest host of the main weekday show – on which he once led a segment asking whether climate change and “extreme weather” were the same thing (they are not).Recently, the chief national correspondent reported that the CIA whistleblower had a political bias against Trump Henry reported this not on one of Fox’s “news” shows, but with the pro-Trump propagandist Sean Hannity.Later, while guest-hosting Fox \u0026amp Friends, Henry discussed how “important” it was that his reporting on Hannity was helping Trump distract people from the impeachment inquiry.Henry’s fellow correspondent Griff Jenkins also sometimes co-hosts Fox \u0026amp Friends, where he gets to ulge exclusive reporting like his allegation that ethnic studies classes aren’t educational. Rather, he said, “they’re making social justice warriors out of children” – a blood-red culture-warrior attack absurd enough to prompt a chuckle from the guest.Jenkins often does field reporting on immigration for Fox \u0026amp Friends, a lowlight of which involved him literally hiding in the bushes along the US-Mexico border to help border patrol detain a migrant family.After they were caught, a seemingly celebratory chyron read “Illegal admits to knowingly breaking the law”. Jenkins closed his report by discussing a wanted murderer and a known gang member who were caught trying to cross the border. Neither had anything to do with the family he helped arrest.Fox \u0026amp Friends’ combination of sloppy news coverage and fierce rightwing opinion is a microcosm of how much Fox values each side of the network.Take, for example, the legitimate journalist and former chief news anchor Shepard Smith: after he had a dramatic on-air feud with the opinion kingpin Tucker Carlson, both Fox News’ CEO and its president reportedly threatened to take Smith off the air if he criticized Carlson again.A few weeks later, Smith resigned from the network he had renewed his contract with last year. The sudden end of his 23-year Fox career shows what happens at that network when news and opinion irreconcilably collide. But on Fox \u0026amp Friends, as with most of the rest of Fox, the “news” knows its place.One of the ways Fox News corrodes politics is by influencing the larger conversation in fact, you may be essentially consuming Fox propaganda without knowing it.And as the network’s flagship morning show for over 20 years, Fox \u0026amp Friends often sets the tone for how the network as a whole discusses any given issue. This line from the pastor and Fox contributor Robert Jeffress sums up a lot of Fox’s abortion coverage:Jeffress’s unhinged comment highlighted a debate you may have heard of about so-called “post-birth” abortion, a procedure disproved by its very name. If the abortion happens after a child is born, then it’s not abortion it’s murder, which is already very illegal everywhere.Yet, as Vox’s Anna North recounted, the idea that there’s such a thing as “post-birth” abortion – and that there are people who want it to be – became such a potent meme that the president spoke against it and congressional Republicans made more than 70 attempts to protect abortion “survivors” with legislation.This abject nonsense spiraled into a mainstream debate because of modest attempts to loosen restrictions on reproductive rights in New York and Virginia. The efforts spurred numerous attacks, including from Trump, who falsely claimed the governor of Virginia had said he “would execute a baby after birth”, and from Fox \u0026amp Friends commentators, who rabidly declared that “infanticide” and “fourth trimester” abortion were actual progressive policy goals.Fox prime time has rightly earned a reputation as a cable TV haven for white supremacy, but, as with all things Fox News, Fox \u0026amp Friends also plays a prominent role.In October 2018, Fox News became a wailing siren on immigration, claiming that the US was under “invasion” by undocumented immigrants – specifically, a group of Central American migrants traveling (mostly walking) over 1,000 miles to the US-Mexico border.In one week, Fox ran nearly eight hours of content on the then distant caravan. Fox \u0026amp Friends started nearly every morning with anti-immigrant hysteria, eventually suggesting the US take military action to “protect our sovereignty” from families fleeing gang violence and endemic poverty.The very day after that comment aired on Fox \u0026amp Friends, a white supremacist murdered 11 Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, because he blamed Jews for helping the “invaders” in the caravan.Caravan hysteria eventually passed, but Fox News’ dangerous and false melodrama about an immigrant “invasion” continued.Some months later, yet another mass shooter struck – this time murdering 20 in El Paso, to stop the “Hiic invasion of Texas”. Kilmeade passionately defended using the dangerously hyperbolic term “invasion” just three days later.Did Fox News inspire two white supremacist mass shootings? Probably not directly. Is it disturbing that America’s number one news network discusses immigration like bloodthirsty white supremacists? Yes.A Fox News executive reportedly told Vanity Fair that the network’s “power comes from” its viewers, and it must defend them.That sentiment neatly encapsulates how and why Fox inspires a strong sense of brand loyalty among its viewers – more so than other cable networks. On a number of issues, from recent (false) allegations of anti-conservative censorship on social media to the tried-and-true (and misleading) trope of “Dems are coming for your guns”, Fox News consistently tells viewers that there are hostile groups that want to revoke their rights, undermine their values, and cause them harm.Breakfast with Friends is a frequently recurring segment in which secondary hosts and correspondents travel to diners across the country, usually shadowing a Trump rally or election debate, to get the pulse of the people.Strangely, when devoted Fox fans go on Fox to offer their opinions, they typically echo the conservative, pro-Trump line you can find from Fox mainstays. Breakfast with Friends has a similar goal to the live audience shows: offering Fox fans an opportunity to appear on TV and enjoy validation from their favorite personalities over sometimes-absurd amounts of breakfast food.Fox News is now attempting to expand its footprint in viewers’ minds with the subscription streaming service Fox Nation. Fox Nation offers original documentaries on favorite rightwing media scandals, shares hot takes from opinionistas like Tomi Lahren and Diamond \u0026amp Silk, and gives some on-air talent a chance to show another side of themselves to the Fox viewer.For example, Kilmeade has an American history series that calls Andrew “Trail of Tears” Jackson a “hero” the contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy has a show about motherhood and Ainsley Earhardt hosts Ainsley’s Bible Study. The aim is to show Fox News superfans what their favorite “Fox News personalities do outside the newsroom”, drawing viewers tighter into the network’s destructive embrace.People who watch Fox News with an open mind can find themselves sucked into a destructive and alienating lifestyle. The writer Luke O’Neil collected several examples of families, his own included, ided by Fox News’ partisan garbage fire. O’Neil and his mother “have agreed to not talk about politics any more. The cognitive dissonance between this lovely woman finding something appealing in the most xenophobic pundits on TV is too hard for me to reconcile.”Others told him about no longer visiting their home towns “because my family and friends all have broken Fox brain” or about not sending their children to see their grandparents because, thanks to Fox News, “their toxic anger and resentment is slowly becoming their entire identity”.I can tell you from personal experience that when I say Fox poisons minds, I’m not being that hyperbolic. While watching Fox \u0026amp Friends every morning, I struggle to unearth or at least assemble even shadows of fact-based arguments from the unhinged nonsense that is vital to the brand.It can be so intense on Fox \u0026amp Friends that I sometimes have what could be called propaganda hangovers – after finishing the show, I feel as though I’m trapped in a fog of disinformation, and my mental processes feel sluggish for a few more minutes.My strongest bulwark against succumbing is strident opposition. Once you know you’re watching stupid bullshit, sometimes that stupid bullshit becomes must-see TV:Fox News is ridiculous, stupid, and – when it doesn’t mean to be – hilarious. Most importantly, it’s an extremely influential stream of conservative misinformation. And the president’s favorite show, Fox \u0026amp Friends, encapsulates the totality of the rotten network’s inherent conflicts and contradictions.It shows how news and opinion is blurred – but opinion wins – and the lengths the network goes to ensure a devoted audience. Fox is a shameless counterfeit of a news organization, and Fox \u0026amp Friends leads the fraud bright and early every morning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d6122f697d853ce67c13da84ae84180dfb9c3c0/0_47_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef856cbe910ee5e569736fd5a641c67f","title":"kanye west jesus is king new album","story":"On the new album, the artist considers religion, the 13th amendment, and his pricey clothing lineAfter many, many delays, Kanye West released his ninth studio album on Friday morning. Jesus is King marks a move to curse-word-free, God-focused music for the rap superstar, who has spoken frequently this year about embracing religion.The 26-minute record departs from the shock-value lyrics of West’s last solo record, Ye (which included the chillingly titled I Thought About Killing You). However, West does provide listeners with an intimate portrait of his changed values, the legacy he hopes to leave his kids, and his continuing struggle with mental illness. The rapper also brings gospel music into exciting new territory – deftly mixing electronic, hip-hop, and choral sounds.The album comes at an interesting time for West. He continues to test his fans’ (more specifically, his black fans’) allegiance with his enthusiastic support of Donald Trump and his Maga followers. He has also claimed slavery was “a choice” and boasted that the Republican party ended slavery, without providing the necessary historical context.For many, Jesus is King is a chance to find out where West’s values really lie.Here’s everything we learned:West provides a passionate, catchy-as-hell ode to the fast food chain Chick-fil-A in his song Closed on Sunday. “Closed on Sunday You my Chick-Fil-A,” he raps in the chorus. Then he says: “You’re my number one, with the lemonade.”As anyone who has craved a chicken sandwich on Sunday knows, the fast-food chain is closed on “the day of rest”, in keeping with the Christian faith. Here, West uses the metaphor as a way of addressing his and his family’s much-needed breaks from the spotlight.The reference might also be a giant troll from West. Like the rapper, Chick-fil-A has attracted its fair share of controversy and criticism. The company has faced widespread criticism over its ties to anti-LGBT Christian groups. Despite all the bad press, Chick-fil-A continues to be successful – it was recently ranked as a top brand among Gen-Zers. Perhaps West is pointing out how he also remains insanely popular despite all his blunders.Since its inception in 2015, fans have complained about the high costs of West’s hyped fashion brand Yeezy. Not everyone has $300 to spend on Yeezy Boosts, his popular line of footwear.West has expressed the desire to makes Yeezy Boosts more affordable and accessible – but that day has yet to come.West defends the high cost of Yeezys by placing the blame on the IRS. “The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe  Man, that’s over half of the pie,” he raps. “That’s why I charge the prices that I charge I can’t be out here dancin’ with the stars.” (Which is some seriously stealth shade to over 321 celebrities, including West’s wife, Kim Kardashian West.)Kanye spends a significant portion of the album talking about temptation and the devil.“Told the devil that I’m going on a strike … I’ve been working for you my whole life,” he raps in the song Hands On. He also says in the song On God: “The devil had my soul, I can’t lie … I bleached my hair for every time I could’ve died.”The lyrics suggest the rapper regrets the secular music he’s built his fame on. In fact, West’s personal pastor recently revealed he had to convince the rapper not to quit rap music and that the star called the genre “devil’s music”.This disavowal of secular music gives fans some insight into why the much-hyped Yandhi was never released. As West raps: “Everybody wanted Yandhi, then Jesus did the laundry.”West references the 13th amendment – which abolishes slavery, but leaves a provision for imprisonment – in two songs on Jesus Is King. First, he touches on the mass incarnation of black men in Hands Up, rapping: “And all my brothers locked up on the yard  You can still be anything you wanna be  Went from one in four to one in three  13th amendment, gotta end it, that’s on me.”Then in On God, West raps: “Wonder if they’re gonna read your rights  13th amendment, three strikes  Made a left when I should’ve made a right.”West previously drew criticism in 2018 when he first voiced his disapproval of the 13th amendment and his desire to see America repeal it. “The 13th amendment is slavery in disguise, meaning it never ended. We are the solution that heals,” he tweeted.This tidbit comes from the slew of candid interviews West is doing around the album. He revealed to the DJ Zane Lowe that finding one of his father’s Playboy copies was a “gateway to a full-on pornography addiction”.He said: “It has impacted every choice I have made in my life from age five to now, having to kick the habit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7be445cd45b2f0c09c449007265824553f8bbda/0_337_4564_2738/master/4564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65f3abb38e66950015fe298aa4469ca9","title":"queen reject glastonbury claims after clash with festival founder","story":"Guitarist rules out 50th anniversary headline slot because of rift with festival founderBrian May has said Queen will not play Glastonbury next year after clashing with the festival’s founder over the controversial badger cull.The 72-year-old guitarist and animal rights campaigner rubbished claims that his band had been booked to headline Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary event next year.Founder Michael Eavis, 84, who is also a dairy farmer, has called May a “danger to farming” and criticised him for his opposition to the badger cull, which is aimed at preventing the spread of bovine TB.Last year, Eavis’s support for the cull prompted the Downton Abbey actor Peter Egan to call on music fans to boycott Glastonbury.Speaking on BBC Radio 2 on Friday, May said Queen, who are touring with American Idol’s Adam Lambert providing the vocals, would not perform at Glastonbury in 2020 unless “things changed radically”.“What bothers me more is that he is in favour of the badger cull, which I regard as a tragedy and unnecessary crime against wildlife.May is also the co-founder of the Save Me animal welfare organisation, which campaigns against fox hunting and badger culling.He started the body in 2010 alongside the environmental campaigner Anne Brummer, and named it after Queen’s 1980 hit.May appeared on Zoe Ball’s show alongside the singer-songwriter James Blunt and Strictly Come Dancing head judge Shirley Ballas. Blunt did not say whether he would perform at Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary.He said: “I’m off on my tour from February around the UK. I will be doing some summer festivals. Glastonbury has always been my favourite gig to play. I’ve played on the Pyramid Stage a couple of times and it’s an amazing place, absolutely.”Diana Ross, who made her name in The Supremes, has already been announced as the performer for next year’s Sunday afternoon Legends slot, which last year was filled by Kylie Minogue.Representatives of Glastonbury have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6153eb99a669455bd5a1a1cc6281c4726c26901/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5abb57b78450b0a1dc7f80a8f5e98a98","title":"were not made to be famous max martin the powerhouse of pure pop","story":"The man behind two decades of hits for Britney, Ariana, Taylor and more is ‘thankful’ singers still put themselves out there. Now, 30 of his songs are getting a second life from ShakespeareEven in a completely empty theatre, Max Martin manages to disappear, choosing to perch himself on the back row, almost completely hidden in shadow. If you didn’t know whom you were looking for, you would assume the long-haired, 48-year-old Swede, dressed in a black T-shirt, was taking a break from shifting props for that night’s performance of the new jukebox musical \u0026amp Juliet.It seems inconceivable that someone so unassuming could have dominated pop music for more than 20 years, but the statistics speak for themselves. Martin has co-written and co-produced 73 US Top 10 singles for the likes of Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry and Britney Spears. Twenty-two went to No 1, with 12 also topping the UK charts. Collectively, these have sold more than 150m copies globally, earning Martin an Oscar nomination, five Grammys and the 2016 Polar Music prize (previously won by Bob Dylan and Patti Smith). Martin’s 22 US No 1s make him the third-most successful songwriter in US chart history, behind only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26).He is the man who introduced the imperishable, if occasionally linguistically questionable, choruses “Hit me baby one more time”, “I kissed a girl and I liked it” and “Backstreet’s back, all right!” to karaoke booths everywhere, with songs that were at once dramatic, melancholic and never less than relentlessly catchy. The hugely ambitious \u0026amp Juliet – a modern re-telling of Shakespeare’s Romeo \u0026amp Juliet in which Juliet decides not to kill herself , but to head to Paris in order to live a little – is woven expertly around 30 of these hits, originally written for artists ranging from Celine Dion to ‘NSync, the Weeknd to Pink.Martin hardly ever gives interviews. “I’m not a shy person,” he clarifies as we sit in one of Manchester Opera House’s tiny bars, his accent a mix of Swedish and the Los Angeles drawl of his adopted home. “I just like to stay in the background as much as possible.”Ever since he earned his first US Top 10 hit in 1997 by co-writing and co-producing fellow Swede Robyn’s Do You Know (What It Takes), Martin has been a self-confessed “studio nerd tucked away in a basement somewhere”. One rock star due to get the Max treatment assumed the quiet man he had met was an engineer and asked him when Martin was due to arrive.We are joined by the writer of \u0026amp Juliet’s book, David West Read, who, much to Martin’s delight, has shown up in a vintage Britney T-shirt. “You’re about to find out I love talking,” Martin continues, popping a snus (a moist tobacco bag, popular in Sweden) under his top lip. “We’ve been putting a lot of work into \u0026amp Juliet and it’s a new field for me, so I don’t mind talking about this.”Martin had been toying with the idea of a jukebox musical for years, inspired by Abba’s global behemoth, Mamma Mia! If a feminist retelling of a Shakespeare soundtracked by Spears sounds like the work of someone who has just had a bump to the head, well, that is because it is. “I had hit my head on a kitchen cabinet and couldn’t look at screens or light for a while,” West Read says (he was concussed). “So I made a playlist of Max’s catalogue and realised that so many of the songs are about young love … of course Romeo \u0026amp Juliet came to mind.”As well as getting involved in the auditions and workshops, Martin also recorded the cast album. “I couldn’t be like: ‘Oh, just do it,’” he says. “A lot of the songs were written with the artists and co-writers, and so I feel responsible for all these people that have been involved throughout my career.” It also represented something that has perhaps been missing from his, as he calls it, “day job”: risk. If you have done it all, your songs turning Swift, Perry and Grande into superstars, where do you go next? “There was so much for me to learn here,” he smiles. “It’s easy to go on autopilot. If I’m feeling uncomfortable then that’s probably where I should be, rather than in a place where I’m like: ‘I totally got this.’”The foundations for Martin’s empire were laid during an apprenticeship with Denniz PoP, whose 90s productions for Ace of Base had become international hits. Martin (born Karl Martin Sandberg in Stockholm) had played the French horn at school when he met PoP (born Dag Krister Volle) he was the frontman of It’s Alive, a Kiss-inspired glam rock band. Discerning that Sandberg had an ear for pop music, PoP – a fan of pseudonyms – rechristened him Max Martin and employed him as a songwriter and producer at his Stockholm powerhouse, Cheiron studios. Cheiron’s records would fuse R\u0026ampB grooves with happysad Abba-esque melodies. The former glam rocker Martin brought an edge of bombast and some weapons-grade melodies, soon employed on records for the Backstreet Boys and the British boyband Five.PoP died of cancer in August 1998, two months before the release of what may be Martin’s most famous creation. ... Baby One More Time, which he wrote singlehandedly, got to No 1 in just about every country it was released. But it almost came to nothing. The demo, Martin remembers, sat lying around for “maybe six months, a year” and attempts were made to pitch it to “really established artists”. Eventually the Backstreet Boys’ label, Jive, offered it to their new signing, Spears. “When I heard her singing, I just knew instantly,” he says. “The way she recorded that song, she added another dimension.”Among the artists who turned it down were TLC, assuming that the line “Hit me baby one more time” advocated domestic violence. Martin and his fellow Swedes at Cheiron had meant it simply as slang for “call me”. Other Martin lyrics of the era also presented problems for West Read when he was weaving them into \u0026amp Juliet. “It’s really kind of confusing,” he says of the Backstreet Boys’ I Want it That Way, a song that seems to undermine itself at every turn.“You know that’s a thing, right?” Martin beams proudly. “Like: ‘What does it mean?’ There were forums of people discussing it.”While the grammatical error that appears in Ariana Grande’s 2014 EDM stomper Break Free (“Now that I’ve become who I really are”) may have been placed there on purpose – including a “juicy line” that sticks in the listener’s memory is a very Max Martin move – the Backstreet Boys song is a clearer example of Martin’s obsession with words serving the melody, a concept he calls “melodic math”.“Growing up, I listened to songs by Abba, Elton John, the Beatles, and I had no idea what they meant, so to me phonetics have always been important,” he explains. “I felt something hearing this music, and it meant something to me. If you can have a great lyric that also phonetically sounds amazing, then you’re golden. But it’s also kind of cool if you write a song and people are emotionally moved without understanding what’s being said. That, to me, is as powerful.”You can hear this technique on Taylor Swift’s Shake It Off, for example. “That’s a mathematical way of thinking, it’s not about doing it by feel,” he concedes. “But if it’s flowing, you don’t need any of that stuff.” He thinks for a moment. “Also, if there was a hard rule then all of my songs would be huge and, trust me, they’re not.”Martin’s early hit rate largely depended on Spears. A handful of their collaborations forms the backbone of \u0026amp Juliet, tracing a narrative arc that runs from ... Baby One More Time’s “my loneliness is killing me” to Stronger’s assertive declaration of the opposite (“My loneliness ain’t killing me no more”). Did you allow yourself a little high five in the studio when you linked those two songs? “Er … maybe,” he laughs, self-effacing as ever.He sighs. “I’m so thankful that someone actually still wants that job. I’ve seen it many many times, what fame does. And it goes back to why I don’t do interviews. Especially now with social media: our lives are on display all the time and when you’re famous it’s on a whole other level. We’re not made to be that famous, it’s not normal. It’s not in our DNA.”His more recent work with the likes of Normani and Grande have seen him embrace the fact that pop’s pendulum has swung away from pop and towards R\u0026ampB and hip-hop, a shift that – when it happened in the early 00s with the rise of Pharrell Williams’s songwriting and production outfit the Neptunes – briefly knocked Martin off course. Does he have similar concerns this time?Suddenly, the musical’s in-house band starts up next door, a sign that Martin is free to stop doing something he is still learning to love. As we get up to leave, we are joined by a PR who needs to speak to Martin about that evening’s opening press night. One-sided discussions are had about red carpets, photographers and local press, with Martin looking increasingly nervous. “I can still arrive via the side door right?” he says, edging back into the shadows.\u0026amp Juliet transfers to the Shaftesbury Theatre, London on 2 November. The cast recording is released on 15 November.Martin’s landmark hits, by Ben Beaumont-Thomas1996: Backstreet Boys – Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)His production would get more sophisticated – the claps sound like the punching sounds from Street Fighter 2 – but the songwriting is already rock solid on his first US Top 10 single.1998: ‘NSync – I Want You BackWith this and Tearin’ Up My Heart, Martin cemented his style of keeningly melancholic minor-key pop despite their crotch-grabbing tempos, they are among the most savagely sad breakup songs ever.1998: Britney Spears – ... Baby One More TimeThe shamelessly provocative video helped her break through, but the song is what matters: one second and three piano notes was all it took to become unforgettable.2004: Kelly Clarkson – Since U Been GoneMartin’s ultra-synthetic pop was innovated out of the zeitgeist by R\u0026ampB, so he wisely took a different tack.

Corbyn is refusing to do so until no deal is removed as an option, and the EU appears to be waiting until Monday’s vote on an election before deciding what length of Brexit extension to grant.The Labour leader said his preference would be for Johnson to “come to parliament on Monday and make it absolutely clear there is no crash out” because his deal leaves open the possibility of moving to World Trade Organization terms at the end of 2020. “He has got to take it out to my satisfaction,” he said.Corbyn’s statement suggests Labour would want some sort of amendment to the Brexit bill to prevent a no-deal departure before it would vote for a general election. But Johnson has shelved his Brexit legislation until an election is granted.Boris Johnson has three options to try and call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and\u0026nbsp9 September\u0026nbspand failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Johnson could try this again and potentially secure Labour backing, because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit.This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson’s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition.\u0026nbspThe leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, can call a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. This needs a simple majority to pass. He has been urged to do this by Johnson several times as a way of triggering an election, but Corbyn has resisted. It begins a 14-day period in which either the prime minister or someone else can try to form a new government. While Johnson could potentially lose this, and therefore his place as prime minister, to another Conservative, Corbyn could also struggle to get enough MPs to rally around him to form a government. The Scottish National party has said it would back him, but the Liberal Democrats have been\u0026nbspextremely vocal\u0026nbspin saying they would not support him. An election is triggered if, at the end of the two-week period, no alternative government has been formed.Corbyn said a no-deal exit was “very dangerous” and could lead to the closure of Ford in Bridgend, Nissan in Sunderland and Airbus in mid Wales.He denied that Labour’s reluctance to go for an election was to do with his standing in the opinion polls and argued that Johnson’s preferred date – 12 December – was “really very odd” being so close to Christmas and after the end of university terms.Corbyn said an election could still take place before that time and that he wanted an election so the country could debate domestic issues and have a chance to end austerity. However, many within his shadow cabinet and parliamentary party are opposed to holding an election while Brexit remains unresolved and the party is trailing behind the Conservatives in the polls.Speaking later on Friday, Johnson struggled to explain why he was pushing so hard for an election when he had managed to reach a Brexit deal with the EU that he was refusing to let parliament debate.His main argument was that he did not want MPs to get into “Brexitology” without the deadline of an election hanging over them. But he has little hope of persuading Labour, the Scottish National party, the Liberal Democrats and other parties to agree to one before Christmas, meaning he will have to make a choice about what else to do with the three-month extension likely to be offered by the EU.“And let’s be clear, this parliament has been sitting now doing absolutely nothing but delay Brexit, pushing it out with delay after delay for three-and-a-half years.“And I think for MPs across the house to have any credibility about delivering Brexit they now have to commit to an election on December 12. So that’s what we’re pushing for.”Johnson finished by saying Corbyn should “man up” and vote for his proposal for an election.No 10 had suggested on Thursday that the government could go “on strike” and refuse to do anything until an election took place but the threat appeared to soften on Friday.After insisting they would “do the bare minimum to keep the country running” on Thursday night, it emerged on Friday that the government will try to push its domestic legislation through parliament as laid out in the Queen’s speech, as well as continuing to push for an early election.“He has a domestic agenda. We want to deliver for the British public,” the prime minister’s spokesman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f79f3f630f35e3f40420b138099f7b93b7e07f12/267_102_3469_2081/master/3469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd811181daf5b4a1c2917dd16dbf479f","title":"production of brexit 50p coin paused amid departure uncertainty","story":"About 1,000 already-minted coins with ‘31 October 2019’ leave date could be worth up to £800 eachThe Treasury has “paused” production of a new 50p coin commemorating Brexit on 31 October after it became clear that the UK is unlikely to leave the EU on time.The special edition was supposed to mark Britain’s departure at the end of the month, but production by the Royal Mint has stopped and already-minted coins are being stockpiled. A Treasury spokesman said: “We have paused production of the Brexit coin, and will take a final decision in due course.”There has been speculation that the estimated 1,000 coins minted so far could fetch a premium on the 50p cover price, possibly selling for as much as £800 each.The chancellor, Sajid Javid, had ordered 3m of the coins to be made ready for the end of the month with the inscription “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations”. Underneath the inscription, the Mint placed the historic date the UK is supposed to leave the EU: 31 October 2019.Treasury officials refused to say whether the Mint will release the coins into circulation or seek to realise their inflated value by selling them on its website.The chancellor could decide to melt them down to be remade with a new date but officials are unlikely to risk going ahead until parliament and the EU give further clarity.Javid’s predecessor, Philip Hammond, had planned a limited edition of about 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for £10 each in time for the first deadline on 29 March.The 50p move is the Treasury’s second U-turn in 24 hours after it confirmed that it had pulled a budget due to be held on 6 November, when the government would have detailed its economic plans and tax and spending priorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba7a29bbac6a1aa72685c9a885b1e6dac1500a7/0_59_6588_3954/master/6588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=006a472b4fbbe61b33f7458af33902b5","title":"strike a contrapposto pose to look more attractive science says","story":"Study finds pose makes waist-to-hip ratio seem lower on one side and looks more appealing Dancers do it, Instagrammers do it, even the Venus de Milo does it. When it comes to striking a pose, it seems the only way is contrapposto. Now research has shed light on why the attitude is so appealing.Experts say the pose, which involves standing with weight predominantly on one foot with a slight twist in the upper body, makes the waist-to-hip ratio appear strikingly low on one side of the body.A low waist-to-hip ratio – reflecting an hourglass shape – has previously been linked to attractiveness and impressions of fertility and health in women.“We think that artists have intuitively figured out that this posture is more attractive, and applied it in their artistic endeavours,” said Dr Farid Pazhoohi, now based at the University of British Columbia, Canada.While research has suggested a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 is deemed most attractive in real women, studies have suggested the most popular imaginary women have even lower ratios – in particular a very small waist – a finding that might help to explain the appeal of characters such as Betty Boop and Jessica Rabbit.Now researchers have shown that both a woman’s pose and the angle from which they are seen can alter their apparent waist-to-hip ratio – potentially explaining why the contrapposto stance is so popular.Although contrapposto is also often used by men – not least Michelangelo’s David – the study did not explore the impact on how their ratio appeared, or how others might respond to it.Writing in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, Pazhooi and colleagues report how they created 3D avatars of a woman standing up straight and contrapposto, with the body cropped from the shoulders to the knee. Each pose was shown from eight different angles. Looking across the body, the waist-to-hip ratio was similar for both poses at all angles. But when left and right sides of the body were considered separately there was a difference. For the standing-straight pose, the left and right waist-to-hip ratios were similar for all angles, except side-on, but for the contrapposto pose the ratio was always far lower on one side of the body than the other.The team showed the images to a total of 68 heterosexual university students, 25 men and 43 women, and asked them to rate how attractive they found them. In addition the team tracked participants’ eye movements as they looked at the images.The results show that men rated the images as more attractive than women, but both sexes rated the contrapposto pose overall as more attractive than standing up straight.Further analysis showed the results to be driven by particular angles of the contrapposto pose proving more attractive than the comparable standing pose – including the front-on view, back-view and the woman facing diagonally away from the the viewer. The eye-tracking data showed for almost all angles of the standing-up-straight pose, both men and women spent about the same length of time looking at the left and right side of the avatar. However for almost all of the contrapposto angles they spent longer looking at one side – the side with the lower waist-to-hip ratio – while their eyes flew to this side first, and more often. In other words, edges that looked curvier grabbed their attention.The study has limitations, including that it did not consider differences in how the figure’s breasts appeared in the different images.However the team suggest the low waist-to-hip ratio produced on one side when standing in a contrapposto pose, and its contrast with the high ratio on the other side, makes a woman stand out from the crowd and appear more attractive.They even suggest the findings may explain why certain movements, gaits and even dance moves in women are deemed more attractive.“For example, when models do catwalk or dancers do belly dancing, they try to appear frequently in exaggerated contrapposto body forms, including lower than 0.7, and people consider these movements very attractive,” said Pazhoohi. “Similarly, when women walk on high heels, it helps accentuate the contrapposto form.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3053f2f4b6a0234d38f486453ecae510e739c719/310_249_2668_1601/master/2668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94878e7b26668b4fd2677817d99e4fbd","title":"barrett new zealand all blacks rugby world cup","story":"The All Blacks have had a pack of Japanese journalists following them around this World Cup. They are the only team who have hired a full-time go-between to translate every last question and answer, which says plenty about their attention to detail and just as much about their desire to crack the Japan market. There is a five-minute slot set aside for their questions at the end of every press conference, and over the weeks, there has been one that has come up over and again. It’s the same question we all ask at one time or another, the one Eddie Jones is convinced he knows the answer to: “What makes you so good?”This week it was Scott Barrett’s turn to field it. Barrett is not a bad man to ask, because whatever they were doing down on the little dairy farm in Taranaki where he, Beauden, and Jordie grew up, it clearly worked. He said it was to do with the ball skills they learned playing different sports – “cricket, basketball, athletics, hockey” – but I prefer his father Kevin’s answer: “It must be something in the milk.” Turns out you really can bottle it. The only surprise is the NZRU has not started flogging it. It was only last week that one of its regional partners, Mitsubishi, announced the launch of a limited-edition range of All Blacks themed SUVs.The Barrett boys have been bunking down together this week. Scott and Beauden, who are both in the starting XV, have been roommates for the first time since they shared the farm’s four-bed dorm in 2002. “Scott’s clearly got his rugby head on,” Beauden says, “because the other night he was calling out lineout moves in his sleep.” They don’t seem to agree which of them used to get the top bunk back home, except that it definitely wasn’t little brother Jordie, who is on the bench this weekend.The change of rooms is not the only switch Scott has made lately. He is starting at blindside flanker for the first time, too. He usually does most of his training with the locks, but this week he has been a full-time member of the back row. The All Blacks’ management are clearly thinking of that game at Twickenham last November, when England were five points up at half-time. Scott came on in the 50th minute and did such a number on England’s lineout that they lost five of their next 10 throws. New Zealand ended up winning 16-15.“It’s quite nice to be rooming with him,” Scott said, “and to chat about stuff to prepare for this game.” It’s a shrewd move by the management, and clever, too, to stick him in with his big brother before the biggest game of his life. They have got a good understanding of the brothers’ family dynamics, which the hooker, Dane Coles, explains this way: “Jordie is a psycho, because he’s been bullied by Scott. So when we play darts in the team room, Jordie loses his guts when he throws one bad dart. Then Scott’s the one who’s nice and calm, and Baz is in-between. He loses it now and again but he does have that calm karma about him.”“Yeah, we’re all pretty competitive,” Beauden admits. “But you’d probably find more rivalry on the lawn at home in the summertime playing backyard cricket than you would in camp. We all play in different positions so it’s hard to compare.” Jordie might not quite agree with that. He played No 15 in his first seven Tests, but now Beauden has moved back there he has been squeezed on to the wing or been busy filling in at fly-half. It can’t be easy competing with your big brother for a spot in the team, especially when he is the best player in the world.Their dad is pretty damn proud of them all, either way. The boys posed for a photo with him after the quarter-final against Ireland, which he watched from the stands. It has not been an easy few weeks. His father, Ted, died recently, and the boys had to decide whether or not they ought to go back for the funeral. They stayed, and after it was over he flew over to join them. “Last week was a tough week for Dad and for ourselves, so it was awesome to share that moment with him,” Beauden said. “It was obviously a tough time. The team were awesome around supporting us and always giving us the option to head home if that’s what we needed to do.”The trouble is, Jordie says, that now Kevin’s here he wants to tell them what to do. “I’m sure he’ll try to add his 10 cents in the next couple of days.” Kevin played flanker himself, for Taranaki and the Hurricanes, so Scott has got the worst of it. “As long as he doesn’t follow some of dad’s tactics from ’98. You probably can’t get away with it now.”Truth is, Kevin taught them all he knows a long time ago. When I went to visit the farm back in 2015, he explained that he thinks the big reason why his kids succeeded is that he made them drill the same basic set of skills when they were young, “How to kick with both feet, pass both ways, and run with the ball in both hands”.Back then, Beauden was still trying to nail down a spot in the All Blacks’ starting XV, Scott had just joined the Crusaders, and Jordie was in his first year at Lincoln University. There are two other brothers as well. Kane, the oldest of the lot, who was playing No 8 for the Auckland Blues until he had to retire because of concussion, and Blake, who is back playing for the local Coastal rugby club. And three sisters too, Jenna, who plays netball for Taranaki, Ella, and Zara, who has Down’s syndrome.Beauden, Jordie, and Scott spoke publicly about that for the first time this year, to help raise awareness of the charity UpsideDowns, which provides funding for speech-therapy services for children with Down’s syndrome. “If people could just treat those with Down’s syndrome equally, that’s all I’d ask,” said Beauden. Their parents treated all eight of them exactly the same, he explained. And that goes back to the most important lesson they learned down on the farm, the one that will serve them long after this match has come and gone.“You have got to realise that rugby is just a game, so enjoy it while you are there,” Kevin told me back then. “It’s special, you put a jersey on and play for your province, or get picked for your country and pull on the All Black jersey, that’s a huge honour. But always remember who you are and where you came from, and always keep your feet on the ground. Because the day you take your jersey off you’re just one of us.” You never met a humbler bunch of superstars. Like Coles says: “They’re good people, and they come from a great family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aab2242d88edfdd90a98de4fedc2d9844b16116/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87a578edc12381f27b0454700f86fb7d","title":"talking horses al dancer cheltenham festival horse racing tips","story":"• Nicky Richards’ veteran chaser can land Cheltenham handicap• Al Dancer puts down Festival marker on chasing debutGiven the weather doubts that afflict today’s Flat racing at Doncaster and Newbury, Cheltenham could find itself at the centre of attention a month earlier than normal. In any case, the jumps track provides a fascinating card of tricky handicaps, from which Duke Of Navan (3.10) may emerge as the best bet.Nicky Richards’s veteran has not achieved the heights that seemed likely when he won the Morebattle Hurdle six years ago but is very useful on his day. He was beaten by a head in this race last year by Modus and no rival of that quality faces him this time, while he gets to run from the same rating. A strong pace seems assured, with Saint Calvados and the newly visored Gino Trail in the line-up, so this might pan out very nicely for Duke Of Navan, a strong-travelling, hold-up type.1.45 Doncaster Michael Dods has eked steady progress out of Troubador, including a fine second in Redcar’s Two-Year-Old Trophy on heavy going when last seen.2.00 Cheltenham With the Nigel Twiston-Davies yard in its usual excellent autumn form, Cogry makes plenty of appeal at a track where he has three wins to his name, including in this race two years back. He came up short by a neck in last year’s renewal, beaten by a well handicapped rival. The opposition looks stronger in numbers than in depth.2.20 Newbury If it’s mud, it must be Morando. Andrew Balding’s grey sloshed home six lengths clear in a similar race at Ascot last time. This is a more testing surface than last year, when he finished in a dead-heat with Young Rascal.2.35 Cheltenham The five-length Chepstow success achieved by Torpillo a fortnight ago counts as the best form on offer. Quel Destin will be sharper for a spin on the Flat at Bath recently but he looked a bit ponderous that day.2.50 Newbury There are some promising types in opposition but it is hard to go against Kinross in light of his eight-length romp on his debut at Newmarket. His yard continues in red-hot form.3.25 Doncaster This Vertem Futurity should be the big race of the day but the usual anticipatory buzz has been subdued because of a disappointing entry and a dismal forecast. Mogul, a full brother to Japan, looks the correct favourite on the strength of his Group Two success but this ground will be a new test and his stablemate Innisfree is a danger.3.45 Cheltenham Steeplechasing did not work out for Gunfleet last term but he has potential from this handicap mark over the smaller obstacles. There was something to like about his return to action, when fourth behind a stablemate at Stratford.4.00 Doncaster He left his challenge a bit too late at Ascot three weeks ago but Came From The Dark can get it right here on ground that he clearly handles very well.Winter officially started at midday here on Friday, as Cheltenham opened its doors and set the clock ticking down towards the National Hunt Festival in March, and Al Dancer was the first horse to put down a serious marker before the championship event in five months’ time with a winning debut over fences in the card’s two-mile novice chase.Al Dancer was one of the best novices over hurdles last season and set off as the 9-2 joint-favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at the Festival on the back of a four-from-four record which included a convincing win in the re-arranged Betfair Handicap Hurdle at Ascot in February. He let his backers down badly, trailing home 10th of 13 finishers, but they had clearly either forgiven or forgotten on Friday since he started at odds-on to beat three opponents.The third fence nearly brought Al Dancer’s afternoon to a premature end, but he survived a serious mistake there and was much more fluent over the remaining obstacles on the way to a four-length win.Al Dancer was available at 33‑1 for the Arkle Trophy on Thursday night but is now top-priced at 14-1 second-favourite behind Willie Mullins’s Melon, the runner-up in last season’s Champion Hurdle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4eb9a7adc41f84983b71af4d7f462c08d1291ab/236_259_4615_2769/master/4615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ee361a3d29950522508fa9629f3e4e6","title":"georgia vardarou choreographer of the future dance umbrella london","story":"The vision of this Greek choreographer – tipped as a major talent of the future at London’s Dance Umbrella festival – is ‘beautifully different’To write about contemporary dance is to sometimes find yourself wondering whether the emperor is wearing any clothes. Is this a profoundly game-changing performance, or just someone messing about on stage?Tonight the emperor is actually wearing jazzy monochrome cycling shorts, and she’s lying on the floor, in silence, with dimly-lit photos of walls and window ledges projected behind her. Later, the emperor – AKA Greek choreographer Georgia Vardarou – wears a gold poncho, or rather she crawls underneath it to become an inert metallic nugget. Nothing much happens after that.Vardarou is performing as part of this year’s Dance Umbrella festival, and comes anointed by Belgium’s high priestess of contemporary dance, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, as part of the Four by Four project. To mark 40 years of Dance Umbrella, four major names of international dance have chosen their “choreographer of the future”. Akram Khan has already picked bharata natyam dancer Mythili Prakash, and next year will see commissions from Jon Maya Sein (nominated by Rocío Molina) and Abby Zbikowski (nominated by Stephen Petronio). Vardarou was the choice of De Keersmaeker, who called her “a beautifully different choreographer”. Vardarou’s world premiere is titled Why should it be more desirable for green fireballs to exist than not? Green fireballs are lights in the sky spotted mostly in the US and have been variously thought to be UFOs, Russian spycraft or natural weather phenomena.There are no flying saucers in Vardarou’s work, but questions of perception, for sure, about what the body can tell us and how we make stories about what we see, though Vardarou gives her audience very little to work with. She crosses the stage a few times in a chain of unembellished poses, a bit like a flexi-limbed doll trying out all its permutations. Then she mostly gives up on moving altogether. There’s a certain strand of European dance that loves to keep its concepts convoluted and its performance unrewarding. Vardarou leaves gaps for the audience to fill. If alien conspiracists teach us anything, it’s that, when there isn’t an obvious answer, we can always come up with something more fantastical to fill the void. So, if Vardarou’s work does nothing for you, is that a failure of the artist’s creativity or the viewer’s? Is this a skilfully conceived challenge to the imagination, or someone with a deadline who ran out of ideas?

We go for a test ride‘Yeee-ees!!” cries my coach, Oliver, as we near the water’s edge. Wave after wave surges towards us, peeling sideways before crumbling at our feet. No closeouts, no guessing where waves will break, just perfect peaks stretching into the distance.Most surfers would be stoked to see this at any beach in the world, but I’m eight miles from Bristol’s centre and three from the English “coast” (if you can call the muddy Severn estuary that) at a man-made surfing venue that opens on 26 October.This £26m project, called The Wave, features a vast, cove-shaped lagoon which can produce up to 1,000 waves per hour, from whitewater for beginners to 1.8-metre barrelling sections for dudes. There’s a wooden-clad ops building with changing, dining and viewing facilities, created with accessibility and sustainability in mind. Beyond it, meadowlands and camping plots are under construction.“It’s the kind of stuff you dream about as a kid,” Oliver says with awe. “I think I used to scribble drawings of this.”As a self-taught surfer of limited skill, I’ve signed up for a 90-minute intermediate lesson – hardly enough time to unpick five years of bad habits. After a warm-up, Oliver introduces me to my board: a large, lime green “foamie”. He says: “What we’re teaching here is exactly the same techniques as at the ocean, from popping up, to currents, to line-up situations, but here we can turn around and look back at exactly the same waves and reassess things. It’s an amazing pathway for learning.”The lagoon is filled with drinking-quality water, and when I dip my toes in I’m glad I heeded his advice to wear a 5mm wetsuit and booties (included in the admission fee, along with boards). Within a minute, Oliver is pushing me into my first wave. “That was perfect,” he says, almost apologetically, as I pop up and ride through the whitewater.My performance nosees thereafter – figuratively and literally – and the next 30 minutes feel like a one-man audition for kook of the day. Oliver remains upbeat, adjusting my stance and guiding me into waves with encouragement. Then comes a lightbulb moment: “You have to think about coming through, not popping up explosively,” he says. Suddenly, the lagoon is no longer my nemesis.The idea of building a surfing lake in Bristol came to The Wave’s founder, Nick Hounsfield, an osteopath and lifelong surfer, in 2011. He wanted to “create a health and wellbeing destination that was safe and cohesive”, open to people who might often feel excluded through “disability, illness, age, gender, background, income, fears”.He contacted Basque firm Wavegarden, but saw their initial designs, used at Surf Snowdonia in Wales, the UK’s first artificial surfing lake, run into issues early on. Luckily, Wavegarden fashioned a new concept. “Snowdonia is powered by an underwater foil, so when they have problems they have to drain the lake,” says Nick. “We’ve got 40 paddles which slide forwards and backwards on a simple rack and pinion system. It’s basic engineering. A computer co-ordinates those paddles, and the lake bed is sculpted like an ocean reef to create different types of waves.”The 70 acres of former agricultural land a short distance from the M5 are highly accessible but removed from the bustle of Bristol. They hope to attract around 150,000 visitors per year and are already planning another venue in London’s Lee Valley.“If you close your eyes, it sounds just like the ocean out here,” says Nick. “But oh my goodness, it’s waves on tap.”Having surfed at Snowdonia last year, I can’t tell the difference, but the advanced surfers I meet are beaming. “I had a blast, people are going to love it,” says board-shaper and Wave ambassador Ben Skinner.The technology allows elite surfers to practise where the biggest waves are generated, while beginners can learn in the safety of the shallows, as they would at a natural beach. What is hugely noticeable is the sense of camaraderie. With up to 80 surfers of differing abilities in the lagoon at any one time – grouped by ability and overseen by “hosts” and coaches (there’s one for every eight people in the beginners’ section) – you’re more likely to have “rival” surfers praise your takeoff than snake your wave. At the end of my session, I convince my coach to let me try the advanced waves. “This is my defining moment,” I joke. “No, don’t put that pressure on yourself it’s just another wave,” Oliver replies. The lagoon is empty and I feel the eyes of a dozen spectators on me. “Paddle, paddle, paddle,” Oliver yells. I pop up fairly smoothly before wrestling my way to the shore. I’m greeted with high-fives from staff. “Everyone in the control room was whooping – they were like ‘he’s up!’” one tells me.I’m simultaneously relieved and thrilled: it’s remarkable how easily frustrations can be swept away by one man-made wave.• The Wave, Washingpool Farm, Easter Compton, Bristol, thewave.

From travel apps and carbon calculators to free public transport, here’s how you can make a differenceIndustry experts believe that a nationwide transport revolution is required to mitigate the climate crisis, and that smart technology could transform the way we travel. Travel apps are making sustainable transport options more accessible to the growing number of people keen to change their travel plans to reduce their environmental impact.Tools include the calculator at EcoPassenger, which directly compares energy consumption and carbon emissions of planes, cars and trains for any journey. Meanwhile, Lime’s new electric bike and scooter sharing scheme is taking off in London and Milton Keynes, and Europe’s leading train and coach app, Trainline, is making greener travel more hassle-free for customers globally by investing in technology to help make train and coach travel across 45 countries more accessible. “Our long-term vision is to enable everyone to travel from A to B much faster and more efficiently, in a way that’s better for the environment,” says Clare Gilmartin, CEO of Trainline. “We use artificial intelligence and advanced mobile technology so that, via our app, customers can travel by train and coach seamlessly, with on-the-go access to real-time journey information, using digital tickets to skip queues and with access to clever features like BusyBot, which harnesses crowdsourced data to help people find a seat on a busy train. We believe smart tech has a crucial role to play in encouraging and enabling people to travel sustainably.”The government has invested £1.5bn in grants between 2015 and 2020 for electric plug-in vehicles and schemes to kickstart the rollout of charge-point infrastructure, while pledging that all new cars and vans should be zero-emission by 2040, according to its Road to Zero strategy. Childs insists this is not enough: “The only way we can make the scale of reductions we need fast enough is by having a revolution in transportation.”Lisbon has one of the world’s largest electric vehicle charging point networks, while Estonia and Luxembourg have introduced countrywide free public transport. “Free public transport is transformational, not only for the environment – it’s also socially progressive,” adds Childs. Trainline found that a quarter of young Brits would reduce time behind the wheel to be more sustainable, and Friends of the Earth is calling for the government to make bus travel free to under-30s to reduce the need for young people to buy cars and help people switch to public transport.By driving positive change through technology, travel apps help create a more sustainable and efficient transport infrastructure, enabling a smoother transition to lower carbon-impact travel, within the UK and beyond.Book travel in and across 45 countries today with Trainline, Europe’s leading train and coach app"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c0f14c375f014dbb2e32b4cec28918b11daf77/227_320_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeeecb8be7305c2efcd9f68dd033bfb7","title":"rail adventures five scenic european journeys to savour","story":"With train travel often more sustainable than driving or flying, now’s the time to leave the car at home. Swap the road for the rails, as Nick Inman provides some of the best train trips in the UK and mainland EuropeRail’s sustainability credentials mean it’s a no-brainer to swap the stress of the airport and traffic jams for the more scenic and greener option. With Europe’s extensive rail network ready to take you directly from city centre to city centre or guide you through some of the best scenery on offer, forget flying or driving, hop on the train. You could stay in Britain and explore unfamiliar parts of the country you don’t normally get to see, or you could take the Eurostar from London to mainland Europe and connect with an international system of high-speed trains and quaint branch lines.Rail is convenient, competitively priced and environmentally friendly. It’s also a reminder that travel is as much about the journey as the destination. It allows you to slow down and think.What are you waiting for?Here are five routes – two at home, three abroad – to get you started. All can be booked through Trainline’s app or website.Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort WilliamIf you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides.Getting to Glasgow: you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain).Typical journey time: Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct.Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy)Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du NordParis Gare de Lyon.Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia andor Genova.Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering PassThis trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains – so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don’t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles – whether real, mock or ruined – and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.Ticket to rideIt is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

Friday’s launch is a test and will only be visible to some users in the US.The initiative is designed to quell criticism on two fronts: by promoting higher quality journalism over misinformation and by appeasing news publishers who have long complained that Facebook profits from journalism without paying for it. The company will pay some publishers between $1m and $3m each year to feature their articles, according to Bloomberg.Participating publications include the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, BuzzFeed, Bloomberg and ABC News, as well as local newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and Dallas Morning News.Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, paid tribute to the importance of “high quality” journalism in an op-ed published in the New York Times, which referenced “how the news has held Facebook accountable when we’ve made mistakes”.Zuckerberg also alluded to the power that Facebook will have to influence the media, stating: “If a publisher posts misinformation, it will no longer appear in the product.”The op-ed does not reference the inclusion of Breitbart News, but the outlet is notorious for its role in promoting extreme rightwing narratives and conspiracy theories. Thousands of major advertisers have blacklisted the site over its extreme views.Founded in 2005 by conservative writer Andrew Breitbart, Breitbart News achieved greater influence and a wider audience under its executive chairman Steve Bannon, who went on to run Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. For years, the publication used a “black crime” tag on articles and promoted anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant views.“We’re the platform for the alt-right,” Bannon told a reporter in 2016.In 2017, BuzzFeed News reported on emails and documents showing how the former Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos had worked directly with a white nationalist and a neo-Nazi to write and edit an article defining the “alt-right” movement and advancing its ideas.Facebook has long faced scrutiny for its reticence to police white nationalism and far-right hate on its platform. In July 2017, the  provided Facebook with a list of 175 pages and groups run by hate groups, as designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center, including neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups. The company removed just nine of them.Following the deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in August 2017 – which was organized in part on a Facebook event page – the company cracked down on some white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups. Enforcement was spotty, however, and a year after Charlottesville, several groups and iniduals involved in Charlottesville were back on Facebook. It was not until March 2019 that the company decided that its policy against hate should include white nationalism, an ideology that promotes the exclusion and expulsion of non-white people from certain nations.Facebook declined to provide a full list of the participating publications or offer further comment.Asked about the inclusion of Breitbart News at a launch event for Facebook News in New York, Zuckerberg declined to comment on “any specific firm” but added, “I do think that part of having this be a trusted source is that it needs to have a ersity of … views in there. I think you want to have content that kind of represents different perspectives, but also in a way that complies with the standards that we have.”The Facebook CEO faced harsh questioning from lawmakers this week, when he testified at a hearing of the US House of Representatives financial services committee. Though the hearing was putatively about Facebook’s plans to launch a cryptocurrency, several representatives pressed Zuckerberg on his company’s poor track record on complying with US civil rights laws, as well as policing hate speech.During an exchange about the company’s decision to allow politicians to promote misinformation in paid advertising, the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pressed Zuckerberg on the inclusion of the Daily Caller, which she called “a publication with well-documented ties to white supremacists”, in the company’s third-party fact-checker program. In 2018, the Atlantic revealed that a former deputy editor of the Daily Caller also wrote under a pseudonym for a white supremacist publication."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a0bde6d5ecf4edfda6efd752b0ac03ad8b72dce/0_104_1109_665/master/1109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3703139d55090fedf38d806eba448522","title":"saudi arabia brokers deal south yemen","story":"Agreement on forming government paves way for wider talks to end five-year warA Saudi-brokered agreement has been reached between the warring sides in the south of Yemen, paving the way for wider peace talks to end the five-year civil war.The Southern Transitional Council, backed by the United Arab Emirates, in August seized control of the southern port city of Aden, leaving the Saudi- and UN-backed government led by President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in possession of little land or effective power. Hadi had already been thrown out of Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, in 2014 by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.The split in the south between Hadi and the STC pitted two normal Gulf allies – the UAE and Saudi Arabia – against one another.The newly negotiated government will involve a 24-member government with an equal number of ministries allocated to the STC and Hadi supporters.The deal is a significant enhancement of the status of the STC, which has previously been excluded from all UN-brokered peace deals, and STC sources appeared to be more pleased with the agreement than the other side.The STC move against Aden in August came after the UAE announced it was pulling most of its troops out of Yemen, leaving Saudi Arabia exposed as the main interventionist regional power.The STC, which is opposed to the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood-aligned party al-Islah in Hadi’s government, said it had discovered rampant corruption once it took over military posts in August.The new agreement, negotiated in Jeddah and Riyadh over more than a month, includes new measures to crack down on corruption and ensure a more even allocation of resources by Yemen’s central bank. The draft agreement postpones the secession issue until the war with the Houthis has been resolved.The STC supports Yemen splitting in two as it was before 1990, and is arguably less committed to the battle to throw the Houthis out of Sana’a, including its bases from which it mounts air raids over the border into Saudi Arabia.The UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, had thought he would be able to announce the agreement between Hadi and the STC last week, but a last-minute dispute over the allocation of resources held back the deal.Griffiths was in Riyadh on Thursday for talks with the Saudi deputy defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman.In preparation for the agreement Saudi forces have already moved into Aden and key military bases, replacing departing UAE troops.The Houthis in September offered a ceasefire with Saudi Arabia, ending their increasingly effective drone and cruise missile attacks into Saudi territory. An extensive prisoner swap programme has been agreed, but the UN is pressing the Saudis to do more to reciprocate.In a further sign of slow diplomatic progress, four joint observation posts have been established to monitor the ceasefire at the Red Sea port of Hodeida, for many years the flashpoint of conflict between the Houthis and Hadi forces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c3e0e7aed4b75de630e851fa4b3c080fa8b5c9/0_335_5019_3011/master/5019.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c71cd9ead2cf38851481c223a3e79de7","title":"solomons government vetoes chinese attempt to lease an island","story":"Agreement for Tulagi, a former Japanese naval base with a deep-water harbour, ‘unlawful’ A Chinese company’s attempt to lease an entire island in the Solomon Islands was unlawful and will not be allowed to go ahead, the Pacific archipelago’s government has announced.The deal between the Solomons’ Central Province and the state-owned China Sam Group was “unlawful, unenforceable and must be terminated with immediate effect”, prime minister Manasseh Sogavare’s office said in a statement.It said the provincial government did not have the power to negotiate the agreement for Tulagi island, which has the type of deep-water harbour coveted by the military.In addition, it said China Sam did not have foreign investor status in the Solomons and no deal could be finalised without the approval of attorney-general John Muria.“It is settled practice that all agreements involving the Solomon Islands government, which includes the provincial governments, must be vetted by the attorney-general before it is executed,” the statement said.“The agreement was not vetted by the Attorney General’s chambers before signing.”Central Province signed the “strategic cooperation agreement” on September 22 – a day after China and the Solomons officially established diplomatic relations following the impoverished Pacific nation’s decision to sever ties with Beijing’s arch-rival Taiwan.But it only became public this month when the media obtained copies of the agreement.Tulagi, an island of about two square kilometres (0.8 square miles) with a population of 1,200, is the site of a former Japanese naval base and was the scene of fierce fighting in World War II.The agreement with China Sam mentioned developing a refinery on the island, but the US and Australia would have been concerned at its potential for dual use as a Chinese military base.US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper applauded the veto, calling it “an important decision to reinforce sovereignty, transparency, and the rule of law.“Many nations in the Pacific have discovered far too late that Chinese use of economic and military levers to expand their influence often is detrimental to them and their people,” Esper said in a statement.The Solomons was previously Taiwan’s largest ally in the Pacific region and the decision to ditch Taipei for China after months of speculation was seen as a major diplomatic coup for Beijing.Days later another Taipei loyalist in the region, Kiribati, did likewise, leaving Taiwan with only four nations that officially recognise it in the Pacific and 15 worldwide.China has become more assertive in the Pacific as its economic might has grown and sees Taiwan as a renegade province that will eventually be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary.Other regional heavyweights, particularly Australia, fear Beijing’s ultimate aim is to set up a naval base in the Pacific that would dramatically increase its military footprint in the area.Such a move would potentially negate the geographic remoteness that provides Australia and New Zealand with a valuable defence buffer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da3f3aab15748203f267da16a0344244b3f0cd6e/774_554_2226_1336/master/2226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8af3fcb897132fee0cea30f75b01d18b","title":"seven

000 customers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShoppers stock up on drinking water at a Lidl store in Leixlip, following the boil water notice affecting more than 600,000 people. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsA boil water notice has been lifted for some 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area. The announcement on Friday evening followed a meeting between the HSE, Irish Water and Fingal County Council regarding the supply from Leixlip Water Treatment Plant. Irish Water said the results for two water samples were received on Friday afternoon and were satisfactory. The “boil water” warning notice was put in place on Tuesday at 11am after a mechanical issue at the Leixlip treatment plant first caused concerns about the quality of supply. The Leixlip plant supplies water to homes, schools and businesses across most of north Dublin city and the Fingal administrative area of north county Dublin, parts of south-west Dublin and parts of counties Meath and Kildare. Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government Eoghan Murphy welcomed the lifting of the boil water notice. However, he said he was “extremely concerned” to discover that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found no system in place to respond adequately to process alarms at the water treatment plant. The EPA’s final audit report will be published in the coming days. Mr Murphy stressed that Irish Water must now work with Fingal County Council to ensure there is no repeat of this type of incident.“Once I have the EPA’s final report, due in the coming days, I will be meeting directly with the managing director of Irish Water and chief executive of Fingal County Council,” he said. The EPA has verified that Irish Water and Fingal County Council have, in the wake of the incident, already implemented the necessary automatic plant shutdown systems.The initial problem was as a result of the disinfectant process for the water at the Leixlip plant being compromised. Subsequent water sample tests were found to be “satisfactory”, according to Irish Water, although the boil water status was retained as a precaution.Yvonne Harris, head of customer operations for Irish Water, said: “Irish Water acknowledge and understand the impact of this boil water notice on the 600,000 people affected and we sincerely regret the inconvenience.”“We endeavoured to keep the public up to date at every stage and we are grateful to the media, elected representatives and members of the public who shared the information on social media and who supported family, friends and neighbours,” she said. “We are grateful to our partners in Fingal County Council who worked with us to provide all of the necessary information to the HSE and EPA to facilitate the lifting of this boil water notice. Since early this morning Fingal County Council flushed the network in key areas to remove the remaining at risk water from the network.” Following disruption for a number of days, businesses will be keen to see normal services resume for the bank holiday weekend. Plant auditThose in the areas affected by the boil water notice could only use boiled or bottled water for drinking and in food preparation. There was a run on bottled water in shops and supermarkets with many places selling out. The end of the “boil water” notice will come as a relief to small businesses in the affected area. Many restaurants and coffee shops were forced to pay for additional bottled drinking water and commercial water rates at the same time. The Restaurant Association of Ireland called on Irish Water to refund restaurants commercial water rates for the days of the notice. Many coffee shops also faced difficulties given that their machines do not bring the water to boiling point. They had to pre-boil water to make it safe for use.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Lisa Nealon looks out at the rain dashing off the Irish Sea from inside one of her two restaurants, doors apart, on Skerries harbour, in north county Dublin. “Water, water everywhere . . . and not a drop to drink,” she says.There were 130 diners in her Blue Bar waterfront eaterie on Tuesday evening when she learned that the running water was polluted and not safe for public consumption.A member of staff spotted something about it on Facebook. “Immediately we stopped serving all our water,” she says. “We have invested in a filtered system so we can serve still and sparkling water free to our customers, but we can’t even use that. We couldn’t serve any ice in the drinks.“Because our filtered water is usually free, we didn’t have any bottled water.” A number of diners grumbled. “There were guests saying this is ridiculous, saying they don’t drink soft drinks.”By Wednesday, there was still no contact from Irish Water, and her second restaurant on the harbour, 5 Rock, was also opening for the rest of the week.Since then they have been sourcing bottled water and ice everyday, while huge pots are boiling off water from 7.30 am in both kitchens, throughout the day, until closing time.“We are busy restaurants. Tonight, we’ll have around 400 covers. Everything is prepared in-house here, everything,” she says.“It all has to go through water that has been boiled. If you walk into our kitchen now, there are four big pots on the go, which we will have to let cool down, and then we go and do it again. The pots are on the go all day.”Nealon was sure the problem would be resolved ahead of what is expected to a busy bank holiday weekend, with up to 2,000 customers expected, depending on the weather, some of them coming from as far as Northern Ireland.“This is really a problem now,” she says. “Everything is really tricky for a busy bank holiday weekend. I don’t know what it is going to cost us as yet — but it will be a large expense.”Daily deliveries of 15 large bags of ice — costing more than €100 a time — are already starting to add up in terms of costs. Weekend supplies have to be ordered by Friday. Even if the tap water was cleared for use, she would be out of pocket by buying in bottled water that is then not needed.“Guests are getting very upset too that we are not able to provide them with free water. There’s that impact alone on the staff and management, with unhappy guests.”Nealon pays Irish Water around €700 every three months for the supply. “It’s not cheap,” she says, adding supplies are cut off three or four times a year for one reason or another, including burst pipes.They had no water on the May bank holiday weekend this year and gets no rebate or compensation for her utility service being disrupted.“We’re still being metered. Although we are taking the water, we can’t use it, unless it is boiled.

Photograph: Eric LukeAt lunchtime one Thursday, a Fianna Fáil TD made his way to the Dáil chamber for a series of votes on Bills and motions that had come before the Dáil that week, on which the House ided. “There was a rake of them, six or seven votes at least. There was a vote on local drug task forces, on the national children’s hospital and a few other things. But each of the motions had a few amendments. “On NCH I was okay but when you have amendments it can be totally confusing.” He said that was especially true of the more niche motions. The TD pointed out the votes took place in isolation from the debate, which occurred earlier that week.“Sometimes with the best will in the world you end up totally bamboozled. You go up and do what the whip tells you to do, press the button whatever way you are told. Since 2011, Dáil Éireann has been practising what it describes as “new politics”. This has manifested itself in two ways. The first is a noticeably less formal approach to parliamentary business. The second revolves around new practices and procedures. Some of those changes, such as dress code, have evolved, others have happened because of the arithmetic of the 32nd Dáil. With no party or combination within 25 votes of an overall majority in 2016, compromises and deals had to be struck which changed the way the Dáil does its business. There is an automatic assumption that most of that change was bad and has led to a dipping in standards. For sure, examples that support that view can be found. But that has to be measured against changes most parliamentarians would see as hugely progressive. Special committees have come together to find solutions for dealing with controversial issues, such as abortion, same sex marriage, the health services (Sláintecare) and climate change. These have produced seminal changes that would not have been possible under the old system. That said, the paralysis of numbers in the Dáil has a downside. And that has manifested itself in a view among some TDs (partly cynical, partly justified) that what happens in the chamber is irrelevant or redundant. And some point to that sentiment, or malaise, as leading to a cavalier and casual attitude to voting in the parliament of the land, as uncovered last week.In the so-called Votegate controversy it was revealed that several TDs across parties had voted on behalf of their colleagues when they were away from their seat, but still present in the Dáil, while Niall Collins voted a number of times for Timmy Dooley when he was absent from the chamber. Last week’s review conducted by Dáil Clerk Peter Finnegan concluded it was not “legally appropriate” to recommend sanctions the two TDs because another inquiry had started. Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said its findings had further eroded public confidence in the working of the Dáil. The  asked some 15 Dáil deputies about their views on standards in the Dáil, and whether they thought they were slipping. All agreed voting for an absent colleague was wrong. But there were mixed views on whether it pointed to a general dip in standards. Most regarded the casual attitude to voting as a relatively isolated trend. Many think the laissez-faire attitude to voting dates back to 2016. However, John Lahart, of Fianna Fáil – who is a teller and au fait with all legislation that passes through – says that the practice of getting other people to vote for you while you’re in the chamber predated his own election as a TD three years ago. There have been more than 300 private members’ Bills since 2016, which many TDs say is unmanageable. Because there is no dominant vote block in the Dáil, half of the Bills have got through to second stage. But for the overwhelming majority of those, the progress has then stalled. They have either been bogged down at committee or the Government has said they required a money message – essentially blocked because they will come at a cost to the State. The upshot is only 10 (that’s a little over 3 per cent) have been enacted and become law. “It’s democratic sabotage,” says Richard Boyd-Barrett of People Before Profit. His group is bringing forward a motion that would prohibit such money messages for Bills where cost is an incidental issue. With such inertia, argue TDs from all sides, votes in the House to advance such Bills begin to lose relevance.“You learn quickly that most of the time your vote does not make any difference,” said one TD. But none believes that this systemic issue justifies the bad practices highlighted this week. “I belong to a (small Independent) group who take our voting very seriously,” said Galway West Deputy Catherine Connolly. “A small number of people have done wrong and that is clear. There are no excuses.”But Connolly does not accept it points to a wider malaise. “The system of voting is very good. I would say every one has made a mistake but you need to correct your mistake. The system is as good as the politicians using it. “When something like this happens, there is a dangerous narrative that we are all at it. The truth is the vast majority are not.”The vastly experienced Donegal TD Pat The Cope Gallagher is also Leas Ceann Comhairle. When he sits in the chair he instructs members to take their designated seats. “Yes they have ignored it. But now that it has come up, I do believe the changes made by the Ceann Comhairle to make sure members take their seats will be able to deal with this issue fully and adequately,” he says.For others, it is an illustration of a Dáil without a decisive majority being an indecisive Dáil on standards. The Independent TD for Clare Michael Harty thinks it’s an illustration of a laxity, which surprised him when he first became a TD. He sees people talking during votes, or taking phone calls, as a sign of people not taking their duties seriously. Like several others, he was critical of Fianna Fáíl’s Lisa Chambers for what he saw as a casual attitude towards casting a vote. “It was extraordinary for it to be not sufficiently important for her to correct the error she made,” he said. She voted at the seat of Dara Calleary when he was absent from the Dáil, then voted in her own seat, when she says she realised her mistake. Like several others, he excoriated certain TDs (in a small minority) answering phone calls in the chamber. With one persistent offender it’s a particularly loud Nokia ring tone, followed by a particularly loud “How are oo?”. A colleague sitting on the press gallery during Leaders’ Questions counted 26 TDs surfing their phones during the debate. Most TDs, have no issue with that. “Members will take their phones or iPads into the chamber,” says Pat The Cope Gallagher. “If they have an urgent calls or text, the member can respond. Under no circumstances, they should not take a call. In fairness it does not happen that often.”Seán Barrett of Fine Gael, a former Ceann Comhairle, believes the Dáil has become too casual. “I get the impression that respect is fading a bit. We all need to be reminded we are going through the doors into the parliament of the State. “Maybe I am a little too conservative and old-fashioned. Maybe it’s to do with my age, but it is important to recognise where you are.”Some of that has to do with dress. The late Tony Gregory set the pattern when he refused to wear a tie. Some of the new Independent TDs who came in in 2011 such as Mick Wallace and Luke Flanagan, preferred T-shirts to shirts. While some would prefer a slightly more formal dress code, fewer TDs of all parties wear ties these days. The language is a bit less formal too now. But “F” bombs (the use of the F-word) still remain relatively rare. Joan Collins was responsible for one recently – Paul Gogarty will always be associated with the most notorious one.“Members have to have respect for themselves and others,” says Pat the Cope. “They still do,” he says, despite the controversy over voting this week.

Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he would like to see a united Ireland in his lifetime.Mr Varadkar was taking part in a phone-in show on Irish radio station Today FM where listeners “could ask him anything”.Asked if he would like to see a united Ireland, he said: “I would, but only in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement so that’s only with the consent of the majority of people in Northern Ireland. “That’s really important stuff and nobody should be forced into anything they don’t want.“And also, I think, if we ever get to that point, we need to make sure that unionists in Northern Ireland and British people in Northern Ireland feel that a united Ireland is a warm place for them.“We don’t want to have a repeat of what happened 100 years ago when a minority were left behind.”Earlier this week, British prime minister Boris Johnson was warned that loyalists in Northern Ireland will “not tolerate an economic united Ireland”.Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O’Neill said on Tuesday that Brexit means the British and Irish governments needs to begin preparing for holding a border poll to have a united Ireland. Ms O’Neill said the poll could take place within five years.DivorceAsked how he feels about the current Brexit impasse, Mr Varadkar said Britain leaving the EU is only stage one of the process, and compared the proceedings to a orce.“There is the sense that we will get a deal. They will ratify it and they will leave the European Union, but then the next thing starts, which is negotiating a new relationship,” he said.“What we’re doing at the moment is a kind of orce. Members are deciding, making sure that the kids are looked after, deciding the financial settlement that type of thing.“The next step then is, how do we get on with each other after orce because we’re still going to need to have a friendship of some sort.“So, it just moves on to the next phase, but the most important thing in the first phase was just to protect those really important things like making sure that wasn’t the Border between North and South and people’s rights are protected and that people can still travel freely between Britain and Ireland.”Mr Varadkar said he has a good relationship with Mr Johnson.The pair had a “private one-on-one meeting” in Cheshire earlier this month in a last-ditch effort to break the Brexit deadlock.Mr Varadkar said: “He is the guy you see, like he is personable, he’s intelligent, he’s witty — he is very normal.“You can talk to him about stuff, you know. Some politicians are really hard to talk to. He’s a little bit eccentric, a little bit alternative.”– PAAn index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4063055.1572030192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu awaits outcome of uk election vote before deciding brexit extension","story":"The EU will wait to see if the House of Commons backs Boris Johnson’s call for a December election on Monday before deciding how much of an extension to allow the UK.Leaders of the EU 27 meeting in Brussels on Friday deferred to Monday evening or Tuesday a decision to grant a three-month extension. Tuesday is just two days before, in the absence of a deal or extension, the UK will crash out of the EU.The move to defer a decision followed an insistence from France’s president Emmanuel Macron that any further extension to Brexit should be clearly justified. France says an agreement to an extension can not be taken for granted.Mr Johnson has asked the EU for a delay in Brexit from October 31st until January 31st, as he was required to do under an Act of parliament. He has made it clear, however, that he does not want an extension of that duration and is now pressing MPs to back his plan for a general election on December 12th.MPs would have several weeks to scrutinise his withdrawal deal with the EU in the meantime, he says.The EU’s stance puts renewed pressure on the Labour Party to back a general election when the issue is voted on in the Commons on Monday. In a bizarre game with the EU of “You first, no you”, Labour has been deferring a decision until an EU decision on the length of the extension.But Brussels is saying implicitly now that the decision allowing a long extension will depend on a guarantee that an election will be held, and that can only be assured if Labour backs Mr Johnson’s vote.No-deal threatLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn was still keeping everyone guessing. He told ITV’s This Morning programme that he would support a parliamentary vote to hold an election if the prime minister came to parliament on Monday and made a commitment to take the threat of a no-deal Brexit off the table.He said Mr Johnson’s position “includes the possibility of a no-deal exit” and the prime minister would have to remove that threat before he would support an election. It’s a high bar but one that, with goodwill – sorely missing – and creative language, Mr Johnson may yet surmount.But Mr Corbyn may have difficulty in his own ranks. Many in the shadow cabinet and parliamentary party are opposed to holding an election while Brexit remains unresolved and the party is trailing behind the Conservatives in the polls.Mr Johnson told Mr Corbyn to “man up” and support the vote. In a letter to the Labour leader, he said: “You have repeatedly said that once the EU accepts parliament’s request for a delay until January 31st, then you would immediately support an election. I assume this remains your position, and therefore you will support an election next week so the voters can replace this broken parliament.”Tusk positionEuropean Council president Donald Tusk, who has been taking soundings in capitals, had been seeking clarity on UK intentions from Mr Johnson before Monday’s extension decision, but ambassadors were taking the view that Mr Johnson’s expressed intentions were not a trusted guide to what would actually happen. Better to see how parliament voted on an election.The French remain adamant both that an extension should be shorter than the three months suggested by the other member states and that it should be conditional on a game-changing event such as an election. Other states, including Denmark and the Netherlands, share the French view that a clear purpose must be advanced.Amélie de Montchalin, France’s Europe minister, wrote on Twitter on Thursday: “What we want is clarity. The question is to know why we are giving extra time, because time alone is not a solution. Let’s wait to see if there will be elections before we get into fictional politics.”Unanimity was not possible on Friday so the compromise agreed was to meet the French halfway. The discussion was described by several ambassadors as very useful.The meeting agreed that a summit would not be necessary to take the decision on an extension – it will be done by “written procedure” – suggesting confidence in a meeting of minds between the French and the rest once the Commons has voted.There is also a consensus to allow the UK to leave earlier that January 31st if and when it ratifies the withdrawal agreement. That could mean, if Mr Johnson’s schedule is kept, an election in December following Brexit. No better platform for a successful election campaign."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4062546.1572003056!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu27 defers decision on length of extension until next week","story":"Britain\u0027s prime minister Boris Johnson says that he is asking parliament to approve a national election to take place on December 12th as part of his efforts to ensure Britain leaves the European Union.

There is a consensus, however, that the UK will be able to leave the EU in advance of that, if and when it ratifies the Withdrawal Agreement.Unanimity was not possible on Friday so the compromise was agreed to meet the French halfway. The discussion was described by several ambassadors as very useful.The British government expects the EU to delay Brexit by three months, says British chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid.General electionMr Javid said Britain was stuck in a “zombie parliament” and that the nation needed to put end to its dysfunction through a general election.He says the Conservatives will ask parliament “again and again” to back an early general election if the opposition fails to support a snap poll in a vote on Monday.“We’re going to bring a vote forward for a general election on Monday,” he told LBC radio.“If Labour does not support that vote, then we will continue to ask for a general election and bring a vote again and again.”It comes as the British government cancelled Mr Javid’s budget planned for November 6th.Opposition parties have signalled that they will deny him the two-thirds majority he needs for it. The British prime minister said he would give MPs until November 6th to scrutinise the withdrawal agreement Bill if they agree to an election.“The way to get Brexit done is, I think, to be reasonable with parliament and say if they genuinely want more time to study this excellent deal, they can have it, but they have to agree to a general election on December 12th,” Mr Johnson told the BBC.Jeremy Corbyn said he would wait for the European Council’s decision on the extension before saying how Labour would vote on the general election motion.“Take no-deal off the table and we will absolutely support an election. I’ve been calling an election ever since the last one because this country needs one in order to deal with all the social injustices, but no-deal must be taken off the table,” he said.Speaking on This Morning about Mr Johnson’s proposed election date, Mr Corbyn said: “The December 12th date is really odd for many reasons. “It’s so near Christmas, it’s after universities have ended their terms, etc.” Asked if he would prefer an election next year, Mr Corbyn said: “Maybe before that, before December 12th.”EU leaders could grant an extension until January 31st but agree, as they did last April, that the UK could leave earlier if the Brexit deal is ratified. Or they could offer a short extension of a few weeks to allow the deal to be ratified at Westminster but agree to extend it until the end of January if parliament rejects the withdrawal agreement. – Additional reporting from ReutersPADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson has written to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urging his support to ‘get Brexit done’. Photograph: Hollie AdamsPA Wire Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a general election on December 12th to break Britain’s Brexit impasse, conceding for the first time he will not meet his “do or die” deadline to leave the European Union next week.Moroever, the Government has also cancelled chancellor Sajid Javid’s budget planned for November 6th. “Parliament has voted for a delay. We’re calling for an election, so we won’t be delivering the Budget on November 6th,” said a Treasury source. Mr Johnson said in a letter to opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn he would give parliament more time to approve his Brexit deal but that politicians must back a December election. It will be his third attempt to try to force a snap election.Just a week before Britain was due to leave the European Union, the EU looks set to grant it an extension to the Brexit deadline, something Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he does not want but was forced to request by the country’s ided parliament.An election is seen by his team as the only way of breaking the deadlock over Brexit after parliament voted in favour of his deal, but then, just minutes later, rejected his preferred timetable which would have met his October 31st deadline.The Labour Party has repeatedly said it will only back an election when it is sure that Mr Johnson cannot lead Britain out of the EU without a deal.“This parliament has refused to take decisions. It cannot refuse to let the voters replace it with a new parliament that can make decisions,” Mr Johnson wrote to Corbyn.“Prolonging this paralysis into 2020 would have dangerous consequences for businesses, jobs and for basic confidence in democratic institutions, already badly damaged by the behaviour of parliament since the referendum. Parliament cannot continue to hold the country hostage.”In parliament after the government announced the new vote on an election for Monday, Labour’s parliamentary business manager Valerie Vaz did not say whether the party would back the move, saying only it would wait to see what the EU says about a delay on Friday.‘Dead in a ditch’More than three years after voting to be the first sovereign country to leave the EU, the future of Brexit is as unclear as ever with Britain still debating when, how or even whether it should go ahead.Last month, Mr Johnson said he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than ask for a delay.But several of his aides think he can weather any criticism for failing to meet the deadline at an election by arguing he was thwarted by politicians and pitting the “people versus the parliament”.At a meeting of his cabinet, some media reported there was disagreement over whether the government should try for an early election, fearing that going to the polls before Brexit was settled might damage the party.But Mr Johnson seems to still hold out hope of securing a deal with Brussels, offering parliament until November 6th to ratify an agreement he settled with the EU last week.“This means that we could get Brexit done before the election on 12 December, if MPs choose to do so,” he said.Labour has long said it cannot back an election until a no-deal Brexit is off the table. But if the EU grants an extension until the end of January, that would appear to remove the threat of Mr Johnson taking Britain out without an agreement.ExtensionEarlier, a senior Downing Street source said Britain would ultimately leave the EU with Mr Johnson’s deal despite the likely additional delay, with the EU considering offering London a three-month flexible Brexit extension.“This ends with us leaving with the PM’s deal,” said the Downing Street source. All eyes are now on not whether, but by how long, the EU decides to extend the Brexit process: Berlin supports a three-month delay, while Paris is pushing for a shorter one.While German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron appear to be fatigued by Brexit, they fear a no-deal exit that would almost certainly hurt global growth, roil financial markets and create a potentially deeper EU crisis.To offer Britain a long extension would take the pressure off British politicians to approve Mr Johnson’s deal and open up possibilities such as a referendum on it. A short extension might focus minds in the British parliament.Brexit was initially supposed to have taken place on March 29th but Mr Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, was forced to delay twice as parliament defeated her Brexit deal.Mr Johnson was forced by parliament on Saturday to send a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting a delay until January 31st. He did so reluctantly, sending an unsigned photocopied note, but the correspondence was accepted.“Our policy remains that we should not delay,” Mr Johnson told parliament on Tuesday after it defeated his extremely tight legislative timetable for ratifying the deal he clinched in Brussels a week ago. – ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A project by the Russian Raptor Research and Conservation Network is tracking 13 of the endangered eagles to better understand what threats they face during their migration south to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia.Outfitted with a mobile phone card, the tracker takes an eagle\u0027s location 12 times a day and texts the coordinates to the researchers\u0027 number in four messages. If the bird is outside mobile coverage area, as is often the case, it stores the data to text once it comes back in range.After spending most of this summer out of coverage in western Kazakhstan, Min flew to Iran so quickly earlier this month that his tracker still couldn\u0027t get a mobile connection. Once he landed near a rubbish dump in Iran, it began sending hundreds of text messages of GPS data, costing the programme\u0027s shoestring budget up to 7,000 roubles (£85) a day. Each text from Iran is priced at 49 roubles, about 25 times more than in Russia and three times more than in Kazakhstan.Min was born near the city of Minusinsk in RussiaMin\u0027s data quickly used up all the researchers\u0027 phone credit, which had already been depleted by three other eagles that flew to Iran, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, SibEco Centre ornithologist Yelena Shnaider told The . The researchers even had to take out a loan.“He wasn\u0027t in touch all summer … We were happy to get a text from him,” she said. “We had expected to get it from Kazakhstan but suddenly he\u0027s in Iran, and we started to get his summer locations at three times the price.”“But Min\u0027s a good boy, about a week ago he left Iran and went to Saudi Arabia where it\u0027s cheaper,” she added. Since she called on supporters to “put money on the eagle\u0027s phone,” more than 250,000 roubles (£3,000) have been raised, enough to track all 13 birds through the end of the year.Featured on the flags of Egypt and Kazakhstan, the steppe eagle can have a wing of more than seven feet and preys upon small mammals and birds in the plains and deserts of Eurasia. It was once found as far west as Ukraine, but its numbers have plummeted in recent years. The species was updated to critically endangered on the IUCN red list in 2015, thanks in part to Russian tracking programmes. The programme is tracking 13 steppe eagles to better understand threats to the critically endangered speciesDuring a long yearly migration south to countries in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, the bird often comes across dangerous power lines or poison traps that farmers put out for wolves and other predators. Not above scavenging from carcasses, it is also highly vulnerable to the veterinary drug diclofenac, which has already killed off 99 per cent of India\u0027s white-rumped vulture population.Tracking the steppe eagles will help environmentalists identify problem areas, Ms Shnaider said. Farmers can be fined for putting out illegal poisons, and companies can be pressured to put bird protecting insulation around power lines. “During wintering and migration the steppe eagle meets many dangers, and we can\u0027t neutralise these dangers across its whole range, but we can focus our efforts on concrete points,” she said. “The main threats are poison and electrocution and illegal hunting, too.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The company received a further 3,000 complaints in the first half of this year.Sean Moran, partner and insolvency specialist at the law firm\u0026nbspShakespeare Martineau, said payday lenders have been under huge pressure from stricter rules brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority that\u0026nbspcapped the total amount of charges and interest payable on loans.“A lot of these companies ruthlessly target young men and women,” Mr Moran said. “The significant rise in personal insolvency rates for the under-25s is of grave concern – they now make up 6.5 per cent of all personal insolvencies in the UK.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Responsible lending is much needed in these difficult times for the UK economy.”David Fisher, chief executive of Cash Euro Net’s parent company Enova International, blamed the FOS for QuickQuid’s collapse.“Over the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015,” he said.“The FOS has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines.”People who have outstanding loans with QuickQuid are advised to continue making repayments as normal.“If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating,” said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service.“Eleven and a half million adults have less than £100 in savings and investments so lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option.\u0026nbsp“If you know you need a specific amount of money for a short while there may be more affordable alternatives out there, so it’s a good idea to shop around before you borrow.”The Money Advice Service website has a guide on alternatives to payday loans, and you can also contact a free helpline on 0800 138 7777Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab341 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1641 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3241 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3441 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we’ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that’s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It’s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors.The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt’s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt’s performance and Gray’s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one.Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it’s one of the best films of the year.This is Renée Zellweger’s Judy. It doesn’t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It’s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film’s creation.4141 Ready or NotAs absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn’t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don’t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning. It’s a timeless metaphor.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab341 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1641 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3241 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3441 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we’ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that’s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It’s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors.The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt’s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt’s performance and Gray’s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one.Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it’s one of the best films of the year.This is Renée Zellweger’s Judy. It doesn’t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It’s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film’s creation.4141 Ready or NotAs absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn’t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don’t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning.

There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 341 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 541 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 641 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 941 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1441 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1741 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2041 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2241 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272541 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3641 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3741 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3841 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 241 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3641 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3741 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3841 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.Earlier this month, former contestant Peter Andre quizzed Garraway\u0026nbspon a potential appearance, saying: “Listen, let me really talk you through if you decide to do it, or if you are already doing this.”This year’s series will see the return of Ant McPartlin alongside\u0026nbspDeclan Donnelly after he took a hiatus from presenting.

However, the album never appeared and no explanation was given for the delay.Earlier this week, a new date of 25 October was announced. After the album again failed to appear, West posted on Twitter to say he was adding final touches to certain songs on the album.\u0026nbspThe album has now been released and is available on major streaming services including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon. You can read our review here.Follow\u0026nbspthe updates as they happenedControversial rapper recently claimed he told people in his studio not to have pre-marital sexHe also said that his support for US president Donald Trump was \u0027God\u0027s practical joke to all liberals\u0027Read our review of\u0026nbspJesus Is KingHe also claimed that his support for US president Donald Trump was \u0027God\u0027s practical joke to all liberals\u0027. Because of course.\u0026nbsphttps:www.arts-entertainmentmusicnewskanye-west-donald-trump-jesus-is-king-zane-lowe-a9170296.html\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA reminder, or explanation for those who have better things to be getting on with than refreshing West\u0027s Spotify page to see if he\u0027s released his new album: West was supposed to release Jesus is King, a Gospel-inspired album, on 27 September – at least according to his wife, Kim Kardashian-West. She then promised the album would definitely be released on 29 September. Obviously that didn\u0027t happen.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhich brings us to today, 25 October, the newly announced release date. Only, the record was supposed to drop at midnight Pacific time, which has now passed. West has since explained he\u0027s decided to change some of the mixes on three tracks, but will not sleep until the album is finished and released.Oh, and Kanye has also now revealed that he\u0027s releasing ANOTHER album – that\u0027s right, even while Jesus is King is yet to appear – on Christmas Day, titled Jesus is Born.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFortunately, I\u0027ve already drawn the short straw and will be working this Christmas. Otherwise I\u0027d start to think Kanye is personally trying to ruin my life.\u0026nbspHere are the details on those wild no sex before marriage comments.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsphttps:www.arts-entertainmentmusicnewskanye-west-jesus-is-king-sex-marriage-new-album-release-tracklist-stream-date-a9170426.html\u0026nbspIn case you missed it the last time Kanye West\u0027s album was delayed, this great piece by Ed Power still seems relevant\u0026nbspMore gems from Kanye\u0027s interview with Zane Lowe:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Give me some other examples where someone is saying what isn’t culturally what you’re supposed to say…Give me an example where someone is saying what you’re not supposed to say. You don’t want to say it, do you liberal?”“And now—I am unquestionably, undoubtedly, the greatest human artist of all time. It’s not even a question at this point. It’s just a fact. For the greatest artist in human existence to put a red hat on was God’s practical joke to all liberals. Like, ‘Nooo, not Kanye!\u0027”Kanye West on the lineage of hip hop, during his Zane Lowe interview:\u0026nbspI love all of these people but you gotta know there’s a lineage of Jay to Ye to Drake. This person is your idol, then you get to know em, then you be friends, then you turn to frenemies, then you turn to enemies, and then you gotta bring back the positive energy. But that’s the lineage of rap kings and inspirers, because Jay was my BIGGEST inspiration. By the time I got to New York and we had the throwbacks, Big Boi had throwbacks first, but there was a little stand at Lenox and I’d be going down there doing beats with Jermaine Dupri and I’d pull up with my throwback and Jay is be like ‘man that’s nice’ then I pull up the next day with another throwback, and then day four they say, ‘what, you stay in Atlanta?\u0027Another bold claim from the Zane Lowe interview:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe also claimed that he would one day become leader of the Free World, saying: “There will be a time when I will be the president of the US and I will remember - any founder that didn\u0027t have the capacity to understand culturally what we were doing.”\u0026nbspThe rapper, who identifies as a Christian,\u0026nbspalso revealed he tried to ban people working on his album from having pre-marital sex.“I thought if we could all focus and fast - families who pray together stay together, he said.\u0026nbspWest also touched upon his exposure to pornography from a young age, and admitted he became addicted to sex following the death of his mother in 2007, which he has previously said had a profound effect on him.This just in (non album-related)\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspKim Kardashian-West has claimed Kanye has banned their daughter North from wearing makeup and crop tops due to his newfound religious beliefs.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“North is trying to get in on the makeup but she\u0027s being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager,” Kim said at a makeup launch event, adding that the discussion had turned into “a big fight in the household right now”.\u0026nbspKanye previously said:\u0026nbsp“I don\u0027t think North should wear crop tops just because I had her wearing a slip dress when she was two-years-old.\u0026nbspI think and feel differently now, now that I\u0027m Christian, now that I\u0027m founder of a three billion dollar organisation and married for five years.”A reminder that this is by no means the first time Kanye has failed to produce the goods when it comes to new music. His album Yandhi, which was supposed to be released last year, never appeared and there has been no indication that he intends on dropping it anytime soon.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor Jesus is King, the original release date was 27 September, then 29 September, and most recently 25 October. We\u0027re about halfway into the day (at least in the UK) and there\u0027s still no sign of it.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog to loadWest recently gave a controversial interview with Zane Lowe on the presenter\u0027s Beats 1 show, where he announced another album,\u0026nbspJesus is Born,\u0026nbspfor Christmas Day.\u0026nbspHe also explained why he refused to be silent over his support for US Donald Trump, and declared himself to be the greatest human artist of all time.\u0026nbspIn another revelation, West – who has identified as a Christian –\u0026nbspsaid he told people working in his studio not to have sex before marriage.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By drilling those holes, the rover is able to analyse the material inside,\u0026nbspturning them into powder and dropping them into a portable lab it carries around inside its belly.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe picture also shows just how far the Curiosity rover has come.

The new experiment saw it use the nine of the cups that are intended for wet chemistry experiments, however, which can be used to look for the carbon-based molecules that form the building blocks of life.That data can then be sent back down to Earth to allow scientists to pick through them and learn about the ancient history of Mars – and whatever life might have called it home.Since there are so few of those cups, researchers only use them when they are sure the possible findings will be important enough. That meant that the rover undertook only the second ever of experiments last month, despite having been on the planet since 2012.We\u0027ve been eager to find an area that would be compelling enough to do wet chemistry, said SAM Principal Investigator Paul\u0026nbspMahaffy\u0026nbspof NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight\u0026nbspCenter\u0026nbspin Greenbelt, Maryland. Now that we\u0027re in the clay-bearing unit, we\u0027ve finally got it.Scientists won\u0027t release the full results of the tests until next year, since the data is extremely complex and takes time to interpret.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These animals should be roaming in the wild with their families but, instead, they have been ripped away from their mothers for more than a year and now sold off for lifelong captivity”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shares dropped to $34.44 following news to shareholders of the company\u0027s disappointing quarter.Its shareholder letter also cited bugs affecting its targeted ad capabilities that share data with measurement and ad partners, the company said. Ad engagements increased 23 per cent, but the cost per engagement dropped 12 per cent.Those bugs include the company\u0027s collection of device data from users that it wasn\u0027t supposed to be targeting, then using that data for targeted ads.

Although this is not unusual for such complaints, Trump and his supporters have seized on it to imply that his information is not reliable.The lawyer for the first intelligence whistleblower is also representing a second whistleblower regarding the President\u0027s actions. Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community\u0027s inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.Former mayor of New York, whose management of the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 won him worldwide praise. As Trump’s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president’s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a “shadow” foreign policy.The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House.The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later.Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn’t even want to.The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump’s opponent in the 2020 election.Joe Biden’s son has been accused of corruption by the president because of his business dealings in Ukraine and China. However, Trump has yet to produce any evidence of corruption and Biden’s lawyer insists he has done nothing wrong.The attorney-general, who proved his loyalty to Trump with his handling of the Mueller report, was mentioned in the Ukraine call as someone president Volodymyr Zelensky should talk to about following up Trump’s preoccupations with the Biden’s and the Clinton emails.The secretary of state initially implied he knew little about the Ukraine phone call - but it later emerged that he was listening in at the time. The Democratic Speaker of the House had long resisted calls from within her own party to back a formal impeachment process against the president, apparently fearing a backlash from voters. On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: “The president must be held accountable.

Despite occupying such an important place in science fiction, as well as being the subject of feverish research by scientists, they are yet to be confirmed.But if they do exist, astronomers have proposed a way that we might be able to see them.Researchers hope that they might be able to spot a wormhole around the supermassive black hole at the middle of our Milky Way galaxy, which is known as Sagittarius A*. There is no specific reason to think the black hole has one – but researchers think that the extreme and turbulent gravitational conditions of a supermassive black hole should be a good place to find one.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberIf there is one lurking at the heart of our galaxy, the stars in our galaxy should be influenced by the gravity of stars at the other end of the wormhole, the researchers suggest. That should make it possible to see one, if indirectly, by looking for the slight deviations in the orbits of the nearby stars.Supermassive black hole exploded in Milky Way, scientists findIf you have two stars, one on each side of the wormhole, the star on our side should feel the gravitational influence of the star that\u0027s on the other side. The gravitational flux will go through the wormhole, said\u0026nbspDejan Stojkovic, cosmologist and professor of physics in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences. So if you map the expected orbit of a star around Sagittarius A*, you should see deviations from that orbit if there is a wormhole there with a star on the other side.Sadly, even if there is a wormhole relatively nearby it will not be possible to travel through it and find yourself elsewhere in the universe, scientists say.Even if a wormhole is traversable, people and spaceships most likely aren\u0027t going to be passing through, said Dr Stojkovic. Realistically, you would need a source of negative energy to keep the wormhole open, and we don\u0027t know how to do that. To create a huge wormhole that\u0027s stable, you need some magic.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than  per cent of voters in my mining villages voted Leave in .”She concluded rightly that the public “feel MPs should work together to resolve Brexit” instead of “slugging it out.”Her attacks at the weekend on the anti-Brexit brigade are part of a consistent pattern since , driven by her belief that the will of the British people must be fulfilled.Her approach is all the more potent because she actually voted Remain in the referendum.But, unlike too many other Remainers in Parliament, she accepted the verdict and has battled to make Brexit work.In that quest, she has had no time for the Parliamentary shenanigans and legalistic manoeuvres that have dominated the withdrawal process, with MPs always “kicking the issue down the road.”Nor, in contrast to most of Labour, does she favour membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, which she said in  would represent “staying in the EU in all but name.”For her principled stand, she has been viciously condemned by others on the left, who have called her a Tory, a turncoat and a traitor.With typical fortitude she has shown no signs of buckling.“I was not elected to Parliament to bow to threats and intimidation. I won’t now,” she says.The charge of treachery is absurd, given that she is abiding by Labour’s  manesto.Moreover, she has devoted most of her adult le to the party.Caroline Flint in  - shes been a Labour MP for  yearsHer warm but steely confidence is a reflection of her tough working-class upbringing.Her deprived background is very dferent from the worlds of privilege inhabited by so many of the affluent liberal Remainers.She was born in  in a home for unmarried mothers in London, the daughter of a -year-old typist Wendy Beasley who later died of alcohol-related liver problems.Flint never knew her biological father.At the age of two, she was adopted by a couple who lived in a one bedroom flat.“My sister and I slept on one side and my parents on the other,” she later recalled of her childhood.Her adoptive parents split up when she was .Her dficulties continued into her young adulthood.Though she was the first member of her family to go to university, she embarked in  on a disastrous marriage to Saief Zammel, a Tunisian stockbroker, by whom she had two children.The marriage fell apart after a series of incidents, including Zammel’s arrest on charges of violent disorder.He was eventually deported from Britain, and Flint was left to bring up their children alone.These were hard times, during which she was turned down for a job at Woolworth’s.But she turned her le around, partly through her involvement with the Labour movement.An MP for  years, she has been a card-carrying Labour member for  years, since she first joined when she was just .Before she was elected to the Commons, she worked as an official for the GMB trade union.“She has more integrity in her little finger than many in that place,” says her fellow Labour MP Laura Smith, referring to the barrage of criticism Flint has endured in Parliament.Despite the fury from the pro-EU mob, she seems to have her Don Valley constituency behind her, precisely because she represents its views.“I think she’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it’s as simple as that,” said Bob Davis, an engineer.Flint was reelected by her constituency Labour party last week, after a petition to throw her out got just  signatures.Part of the admiration for her stems from her capacity – as she has shown over Brexit – to speak her own mind, instead of meekly following the trendy left-wing orthodoxy.So while others in her party wailed about Tory benefit cuts, she attacked the culture of welfare dependency, where claimants expected something for nothing.Given her experience, it is a travesty to pretend she is some kind of anti-Labour hack.With her roots in the working-class, she is far more in touch with ordinary people that most posturing, preening Remainers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Under Theresa May’s we could have been trapped in it forever, unable to do global trade deals.To put it back into the agreement kills it. Not least because the deal agreed with Brussels is merely the mechanism by which we leave — it is not meant to determine our future relationship.One Labour MP vows to support Boris’s Bill, then back this amendment destroying it. If the public considers MPs ocean-going idiots, this is why.But the EU should help get the deal over the line by rejecting the extension Remainers forced the PM to request.MPs would have to pass it or revoke Brexit. They lack the guts for the latter.HARRY and Meghan are not victims. Not of tabloid “bullying”. Not of racism.Their claim that they are “existing, not living” is a tin-eared insult to millions who find joy despite daily struggles dwarfing those of this cosseted pair.The Sun could not have been happier for them when they married. We called their magical wedding “a wonderful symbol of the country we have become. Open, warm-hearted, brilliantly erse”.We’re sorrythey didn’t understand that along with the adulation would come other stories in the public interest — and scrutinythey chose to lecture the public on how to live their lives.Instead of maturely accepting it, or ignoring it, they declared war on the Press and indulged in a giant whinge.No, Royals with publicly-funded mansions, fabulous holidays and staff are not disqualied from being unhappy. Harry and Meghan do seem to be ­vulnerable and need help. But they should count their many blessings too.And spare a thought for those who endure crippling rents, mortgages, bills and tough, low-paid jobs with far more fortitude and less self-pity.FUNNY how so many MPs trashing our democracy no longer have skin in the game.Take giggling birdbrain Oliver Letwin whose calamitous career, a bulging ­dossier of catastrophic failure, will end before the next election. Or Speaker Bercow — the grandiloquent, circumlocutory, periphrastic, tautological Remainer slug — who is off soon too.Meanwhile Labour is now openly betraying its  Leave voters while desperately trying to avoid an election.So many politicians — unaccountable and yet key to thwarting the .million majority.

Meghan is struggling with le as a new motherand the global attention that comes with joining the “The Firm”. And Harry wants to protect her.But their latest complaints seemed poorly timed and worryingly self-indulgent. How  can you describe the royal couple seeing impoverished young African girls learning to box so they can fight off sexual predators, then using air time to address their First World problems with the media The same media, I might add, that was praising Meghan’s obvious intelligence and charm and had hitherto featured glowing reports from their first official overseas tour together.Prince William is reportedly “worried” about his brother’s state of mind, and after watching the documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey, one could only agree and conclude that we’re seeing a man teetering on the edge.The rampant paranoia, the relentless victim narrative and a tendency towards the dramatic are all perhaps signs that Harry does indeed need to take a break from public le before he unravels even further.But during that respite, he must surely seek specialist help and ask himself this: Is his obvious angst really just down to the media occasionally writing inconvenient truths about his we’s fractured family and questioning the couple’s obvious hypocrisy at using private jets while preaching about climate change OR is it the result of unresolved issues surrounding his mother Diana’s untimely death  My money’s on the latter, not least because Harry’s escalating rhetoric around the “safety of my family” rang alarm bells with me.As a child, my husband witnessed the accidental death of his -month- old brother and was put in the ambulance with his screaming mother. When he was , his -year- old father died suddenly at home during an afternoon nap.Both were deeply traumatic events that, by the time we met in , he thought he’d dealt with. But, in late , the birth of our daughter triggered a delayed response and he became riven with anxiety that something might happen to her.He developed the now resolved habit of what psychiatrist’s might refer to as “catastrophising” where, in his mind, a cut finger would escalate to potential sepsis and, like  Harry, “the safety of my ­family”  was an oft repeated mantra to try to  quash rational debate.Put simply, he felt a loss of ­control over what happened to his brother and father, which then manested itself in a disproportionately dramatic reaction to even the simplest of le’s problems and an inability to see past them.So I can only wonder whether the birth of his son Archie has triggered the same powerful reaction in Harry, who admits he thought he was out of the woods with his mental health, “but suddenly it all came back.” It would certainly explain his tears at the recent WellChild Awards, where his speech centred on his and Meghan’s feelings since having achild rather than focusing on the stories of those being celebrated.And it was “the safety of my family” he used to explain the use of private jets when, just a few days later, William and Kate — the future King and Queen of Britain — quietly boarded a commercial flight to Scotland with their kids and the dference in attitudes was there for all to see.Both William and Harry suffered the untimely loss of their mother and — wrongly, to my mind — faced the intolerable pressure of having to walk behind her coffin while the world looked on.BUT as William has clearly learned toaround the trauma and get on with his le in a mature and rational way, Harry still seems troubled, angry and prone to irrational outbursts.“I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,” he declared to interviewer and friend Tom Bradby.The tragic sequence of events that led to the death of his mother were going to the Paris Ritz with an international playboy, deciding to leave the safety of their hotel suite at midnight when they knew there were motorbike paps outside, unwittingly getting into a car driven by someone well over the drink-drive limit and not wearing a seatbelt.So yes, the paparazzi followed the carand, in an ideal world, they wouldn’t have.But a French inquiry cleared the bikes of involvement in the crash and, in the real world, anyone famous knows thatyou don’t want to be “papped” you live your le accordingly by maintaining a low profile and avoiding celebrity hang-outs.The Cambridges know that ­living a quiet, unremarkable le is the greatest antidote to unwanted media attention but also accept that the trade-off for the privilege le of being royal is that, ­occasionally, there will be “off message” stories and opinions they don’t like.On the South Africa tour, tetchy Prince Harry behaved like an entitled elite when he chastised Sky’s invited royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills for asking him a perfectly anodyne question about his visit.Later, while reporting from William and Kate’s hugely successful tour of Pakistan, Rhiannon praised the Cambridges for their regular and friendly interactions with the media.She observes that they clearly understand that official duty for Queen and country come first.“Compare it with the tone of the end of Prince Harry and Meghan’s tour a few weeks ago and you couldn’t have a bigger contrast,” she adds. “Harry had made it all about them by releasing a statement announcing legal action against The Mail on Sunday and criticising the Press.”EQUALLY, it’s worth noting that, like Meghan, Kate also had to adapt to royal le and, despite being mum to three young children, has never publicly complained about her lot.Probably because she understands that there are millions of people in the country with far worse problems and without the support network or finances to cushion the blow.That’s a rational outlook but, right now, Harry is clearly locked in a victim narrative where the nasty Press hunted his mother to her death and even the mildest criticism of him or his we is taken as “bullying” behaviour that threatens their very existence.I feel sympathy for him, but only he can change that self-pitying narrative, with his we’s support. Unfortunately, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have a close-knit family around her and, judging by what she said in the same ­documentary, may be enabling rather than ­calming his paranoia.She said her British friends had warned her off marrying Harry because “the British tabloids will destroy your le.” Really  Or did they rightly just advise that the Press attention would be several notches higher than she’d been used to  Particularly as she has a rather off- message family Certainly not the poor man at Wimbledon who got ticked off by “Meghan’s ­people” for trying to take a photo of her when he was actually taking a selfie.No, it’s definitely time for a ­period of rest and, ­hopefully, reflection.  And , at the end of it, they decide to step away from royal le and live as private citizens, then we wish them nothing but the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris believes in better times.Like Buzz Lightyear he punches the air and cries: “To infinity and beyond!”What do you think when you see Big Ben or a photograph of the twirly-towered Houses of Parliament standing next to the gracious River Thames Most of us, I guess, used to feel a little bounce of patriotism when we heard Big Ben’s bongs.But the bonging has long since ceased to have that effect — indeed, the bongs don’t even sound any more, owing to the repairs being done to the clock tower.The sheer sight of Parliament now, I suspect, fills many voters with feelings of irritation and boredom, and maybe worse.As Bonfire Night approaches, it may never have been easier to sympathise with Guy Fawkes and his gunpowder plotters.This is, please, not an incitement to you all to burrow into the cellars under the Palace of Westminster with barrels of explosives and fizzing fuses.But would it not be tempting to tie a stick or two of dynamite to the tail of Commons Speaker John Bercow Is there not at least a small part of you that would welcome a big, cartoon-style ka-boom in the Commons lavatories and seeing the likes of Hilary Benn and Dominic Grieve QC and Yvette Cooper and Sir Oliver Ruddy Letwin emerging with their faces sooted, their hairdos standing up on end and their trousers round their knocking knees Back in the days of the Soviet Union there was a man called Andrei Gromyko, who was almost a self-parody of grumpiness.Gromyko was foreign minister for the Soviets from - and he undoubtedly had a brilliant mind.Yet there he would stand on the Kremlin’s viewing balcony at the May Day parades, wrapped tight into his smart coat and hat, and his grim, unyielding face said it all.Gromyko wanted no change. He wanted the status quo to last forever.He became known as Mr Nyet. That’s Nyet for No, never forever. Well, the brutal Soviet empire didn’t last for ever, as we now know.Gromyko stood on the wrong side of history. Soviet Marxism was shattered and the Berlin Wall fell.Parliamentary opponents of Brexit will one day be seen to have been similarly obstructive.Like Gromyko, the only answer they have is the negative.It is not because they are stupid. Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer, and that giggling nitwit Letwin, are well-read gents.Hilary Benn is probably brighter than his old man Tony was.Grieve and Anna Soubry are both lawyers, though you might not want them defending you in a big trial in case they got up the jury’s noses with their stone-faced insistence that no one  can possibly ever be right.And then there’s Bercow. The soon-to-depart speaker is a chippy, itchy, batey little piglet and one of the most gloriously public cuckolds of the kingdom but he has a perfectly good brain on him.It’s not lack of cleverness that afflicts them. It is their inability to realise that the public wants hope.Voters crave optimism in their politicians.They want leaders who offer solutions, not dismal shroud-wavers like Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.And after three years of this inertia, the desire for some brightness and happiness has never been keener.That is why Boris is flying in the opinion polls.It may not be that we all like every dotted I and crossed T of his Brexit deal.Plenty of us would have accepted No Deal. It is not that the voters have suddenly become Tories.But they warm to the Johnsonian can-do spirit.When everyone said he would never extract concessions from Brussels, he did.When everyone said he was a shallow joker, he found a statesmanlike tone which hailed European civilisation while embracing British independence.His opponents, lips curling, said he was just a racist, sexist nationalist who would sell out to Donald Trump.Boris crinkled his eyes, spoke up for the NHS and talked of healing and progress.Britain has had enough of the grumps and glumbuckets.Parliament needs to rediscover the miraculous qualities of the words “can” and “yes”. Buzz Lightyear Boris gets that. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is totally understandable. But there is a risk to attempting it before delivering Brexit as he promised.There is a danger too, of course, that Remainers will kill his deal in the next fortnight via fatal amendments. Most Labour “moderates” in Leave seats cannot be trusted to back it, however much they hope to pull the wool over their constituents’ eyes.But the PM can then go to the polls promising that a Tory majority will reverse their tricks and finalise his deal.As it stands, Labour must agree to any election. And it is truly jaw-dropping to watch them running away, having screamed for so long for the chance to replace the dastardly Tories.With their ratings in freefall and in mortal fear of Boris’s popularity, they concoct ever more ludicrous excuses to dodge a reckoning. It is shredding the last remnants of their credibility.The public wants an election, by  per cent to . Labour cannot hide from it.They are stricken, ided and handicapped by the most unpopular political leader in UK history — but they will be seen too as snivelling cowards who put their party before their country.For the moment, though, Boris’s best bet is as his slogan says: to get Brexit done.IT is a scandal that the fracking revolution was strangled at birth.The Whitehall report saying it is “years behind schedule” doesn’t nearly cover the failure.Shale gas could power Britain cheaply for a generation, lower bills and create thousands of jobs. It would be far more eco-friendly than burning coal.But the Tories lost the PR war against a green social media campaign which terried the public using debunked and out-of-date US scare stories. Most people know little of fracking except that they are meant to despise and fear it.The Cameron Government could have pushed back hard. Instead it buckled and hit fracking firms with regulations making exploration all but impossible.What a calamitous missed opportunity.IT is impossible to imagine the terrying ordeal of the  migrants who died in a refrigerated truck.And we recoil at the evil and greed of the traffickers who have profited from this appalling tragedy.The only comfort is that there is every chance, from the details already known, that they will be brought to justice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While it is unfortunate this may be taking place, it is encouraging that there has been a steady decrease in the already small numbers of our people previously balloted. In October , when activity was last planned, ultimately none of our people actually took action.“As a growing and successful organisation we, along with our franchisees, will continue to invest in our people and create quality jobs and opportunities for all.

Labouraposs shadow housing minister John Healey said: The Toriesapos pathetic housing proposals have nothing to offer the north of England.

Addressing an audience at Factory , the University of Sheffieldaposs advanced manufacturing research centre, she said: The benefits are clear - some modular homes can be built in a factory over a week and assembled on site in a day. Modular housing involves building the majority of a property in a factory beforehand, allowing for mass production and for the main structure to be transported in one go to the site and fitted into place. Backers of prefab construction point to the need for less construction traffic and the need to address the sectoraposs ageing core workforce, which is currently being topped up by migrant workers. Critics, however, say smaller suppliers are overlooked in the process and imported materials are favoured, whereas traditionally constructed homes contain % of UK-produced materials. Mike Leonard, from Building Alliance, said modular houses would last for only half the time of a masonry-built home - approximately  years - and were fire prone given their timber structures. They are not designed to last. To put it bluntly, they are caravans without wheels, said the chief executive.

The pioneering experiment is taking place on a -mile circuit in south London, but the exact route is being kept secret by the government-backed consortium behind the project. Trials began this week in Bromley and Croydon using converted Ford Mondeos to seethe technology can operate safely on Britain’s busy roads. Cars designed by British tech company FiveAI, which was given a £.m government grant to develop self-driving vehicles, will be carrying one of  volunteers everyday. But at least two people will be in the cars at all times for safety reasons - a back up driver and a technician as well as the volunteer passenger and the top speed will be mph. Before the latest trials tests of driverless cars on public roads in the UK have not involved ordinary members of the public.    The passengers in the south London tests are believed to be employees of the Direct Line insurance company, which is backing the project. StreetWise, the consortium behind the project is planning around  test trips over the next two months and the cars are fitted with a system of cameras, radar and sensors to detect traffic, pedestrians and other objects. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps described the trials as a “major step” towards driverless cars becoming a common sight in Britain. He said: ”The untapped potential of self-driving vehicle technology is huge — it could enhance road safety, tackle isolation, and create economic opportunities. “The Government’s Future of Mobility: Urban Strategy sets out how it is planning for the introduction of self-driving vehicles, and Street​Wise’s successful trial ​will be a major step to rolling out the next phase of the UK’s transport revolution.”    The Department for Transport is behind a £m initiative to get self-driving cars on Britain’s roads within two years. Stan Boland, co-founder of FiveAI, said the most driverless trials so far had been conducted in the West Coast of America where, roads tended to be wider and on a grid system. He added: “In Northern Europe, we have lower lighting, poorer satellite coverage, higher rainfall and greater density of road users. “We also have to deal with erratic, medieval street plans that are nothing like the grid systems of the US.” There have been safety concerns about driverless cars and last year in America, a -year-old mother-of-two died in Arizona when she was hit by a self-driving Uber Volvo at mph after it didn’t attempt to brake.

Described as a foolish and blatant attempt to import a weapon into the UK, the audacious plan has seen Carlo Sen, , and his half-brother Stephen Gibson, , jailed and their partners handed suspended sentences. After the pair persuaded a local person in the southernmost US state to buy the gun for them, Senaposs partner Rebekah Simons, , and Gibsonaposs girlfriend Louise Caswell, , posted assault rle parts disguised as fishing kit back to their home. They dismantled the weapon and disguised the parts as fishing equipment which they put into parcels.    In June  Homeland Security agents in the US intercepted a package about to be shipped to Caswell in Retford, Nottingham. It contained the lower receiver, barrel shroud, magazines and stock of the AR - the model of firearm used in several mass shootings in America, including the  Aurora cinema shooting and the Parkland school shooting. National Crime Agency officers, working with Border Force, intercepted a second package in the UK which contained the barrel of the rle and was also addressed to Caswell.    The group had attempted to disguise the packages as personal fishing equipment, and included a fishing rod reel along with the barrel. Jobless Gibson and Caswell were arrested at their home in London Road, Retford, Nottingham, and officers established Sen paid for them to go on the trip. Sen, who claimed to be a professional gambler, fled to Italy but was arrested with Simons, a nursery nurse, after they ed to the UK.  The foursome were found guilty of conspiring to import and possess a firearm after a trial at Nottingham Crown Court on Wednesday. Sen was jailed for three years while Gibson was sentenced to two years in prison while Simons and Caswell were handed suspended sentences. The court heard that before Sen was arrested he destroyed his sim card and deleted the contents of his phone and claimed he did so to remove evidence of a one night stand he had in Italy. In a bid to defend their actions, the group told the jury they had wanted to go shooting on their trip but heard it was expensive.

Fr Matthew Jolley, who was ordained a priest in the Archdiocese of Liverpool in , pleaded guilty to one offence of arranging the commission of a child sex offence. Jolley, , of Great Sankey, Warrington, appeared by videolink from HMP Altcourse to be sentenced this afternoon, reports the Liverpool Echo.At the time the offence was committed last month, Jolley, who served as Catholic priest in Widnes, had just ed to the UK from Belgium and was due to travel to Rome for a two-year period of study. The court heard Jolley came to the attention of authorities when he engaged in disgusting chat on ious online s - including Grindr - about having sex with a two-year-old boy.  Jolley thought he was communicating with the childaposs father, but in fact it was an undercover law enforcement officer trained to root out such perverts. Alaric Walmsley, prosecuting, said Jolley created a profile as a -year-old bisexual male on Grindr, using the name Breed Me. Over a series of exchanges with the undercover operator, Jolley spoke about his sexual interest in young children, both male and female, with no age limit so long as theyaposre cute. When the undercover operator mentioned a two-year-old son, Jolleyaposs response to the fictitious child was whether I could share him.  The interaction then moved to the Kik messenger service, and continued on the Wickr encrypted , with Jolley asking for indecent pictures and videos. Mr Walmsley said Jolley then arranged to go to the dadaposs address in Hale Village, in order to sexually abuse his son. During the meeting Jolley again discussed how he planned to abuse the child. When the undercover operative revealed his true identity to Jolley, the shamed priest struggled and tried to escape but was restrained and arrested on suspicion of child sex offences.  Mark Shanks, defending, said Jolley felt utterly ashamed and appalled by his behaviour.Mr Shanks said thata two-year-old boy had been produced, Jolley said he would have run a mile. Mr Shanks added: His job and his interests were separate and he did not join the church to engage in activity with children. His career is ruined and he intends to take another job on his release. Sentencing Jolley to  months in prison, Recorder Jeremy Lasker said: Your words and actions and intentions seem to me wholly inconsistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church. You have done nothing but a great disservice to the Church. On top of the custodial sentence Jolley was ordered to sign the sex offenders register for le. Following sentencing, Detective Constable Louise Murphy, of Cheshireaposs On-line Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: Jolley committed this terrible offence whilst holding a position of trust. Through his online communications it was clear to see that he was sexually attracted to young children and would do whatever he could in order to fulfil his own sexual gratication.

A poll of , adults found one in four still buys single-use carrier bags,  per cent drive short distances they could easily walk, and a third arenapost recycling enough. And  per cent confess to having an aposIaposll do it tomorrowapos approach to being more eco-friendly. Smart Energy GB has commissioned the research to highlight the positive impact that one person acting now can have on the future of the environment. It is also launching a new partnership with the National Trust in which augmented reality devices are being installed at six properties across the country to offer a glimpse of what the natural world could be like in  yearsapos time.  The experience takes visitors to the year  showing what could happen to the places we lovewe donapost take action to become more sustainable as a nation. Sacha Deshmukh, CEO of Smart Energy GB said: This study clearly indicates many Brits donapost realise that the small steps they can take will have a positive affect on the environment, but the good news is we all have the power to make a dference. Visitors to the National Trust will see first-hand what could happenwe donapost all take action now. The joint venture demonstrates the National Trustaposs ongoing commitment to tackle the climate emergency by using less energy and protecting the environment, whether thataposs capturing the energy of mountain streams, installing solar  and smart meters in historic houses across Great Britain, or looking after woodlands.  Andevery household took energy efficiency measures now, we could achieve  per cent of the UKaposs  carbon target. But when it comes to energy use,  per cent of adults forget to turn the lights off at their house, and  per cent drive short distances they could easily walk. Around one in four confessed to still buying carrier bags from the supermarket rather than using bags for le while more than a quarter throw food waste straight into the bin, rather than composting it or putting it into food waste. More than a quarter also put their washing on at  degrees or higher.  But more than six in  admitted to feelings of guilt when binning something that could have been recycled, with a bit more effort. And a third believe there is more they could do when it comes to recycling in their household. Encouragingly,  per cent have installed a smart meter to monitor their energy usage, with a view to reducing how much they use. Four in  of those polled via OnePoll also said they do more now than they did a year ago, in a bid to help the environment.  But while the same percentage say itaposs because they care about their own futures,  per cent do it to make the planet better for their kids in years to come. Shockingly, nearly a fth of the population arenapost even convinced that climate change is a real problem. And three in  believe the importance of it has been over-exaggerated. Sacha Deshmukh added: As a nation, upgrading from an old analogue meter to a smart meter will contribute to a  per cent C saving by . Smart meters are the foundation of a smart energy system which will enable us to meet our net zero carbon targets, reduce wastage at source, allowing for the mass uptake of electric vehicles and better use renewable energy.

What I’ve seen since coming back is the mentality of the club changing.”And Butcher is calling on the fans to turn out in their numbers tomorrow as the Tangerines look to maintain their perfect home record on the back of three away defeats.And that kind of form, performing at two ends of the spectrum is something he and the rest of the squad are keen to put right.Butcher added: “All I can say to the fans is they need to get behind us still and they’re going to be our driving force to get us to where we need to be.“We need to make sure we’re not performing at two extremes.“We’ve been really extreme this season, going back and forth with results. The - derby win and - against Morton and then going away and losing two on the spin, you never see that coming but, ultimately, it’s about theof the season.“There’s a long way to go yet. There’s some big games coming up and people are going to drop points but we just need to go on a four, five, six-game run and make sure we’re all together, pulling in the right direction. Turnarounds from defeats can make a season.”Of opponents the Pars, Butcher added: “The last time we played them we identied that they were a strong side.“We also know that every team who plays us wants to beat us more than any other team in this league. We are the scalp in the league as such.“We need to be at % to be dominating and beating teams.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47867780-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47867780-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47867780-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47867780-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee sign goalkeeper after jack hamilton ruled out","story":"Dundee have signed Celtic goalkeeper Conor Hazard on an emergency loan after No  Jack Hamilton was struck down with appendicitis.With only young goalie Calum Ferrie on the books, that has prompted manager James McPake to look for an emergency loan.And the Dark Blues boss has snapped up -year-old Celtic keeper Conor Hazard on such a deal ahead of the trip to Ayr United tomorrow.How long Hamilton will be out for is yet to be confirmed after having his appendix removed earlier this week but the Dens gaffer is taking no chances by moving to bring in Hazard.The Northern Ireland international goalie has had loan spells at Falkirk and Partick Thistle in the Championship over the past couple of years.Manager James McPake said: “It’s very frustrating for Jack and the team.

This means they are without a win in their last five league matches.Speaking after Saturday’s - defeat against Coventry, Stars coach Omar Pacha said: “The positives are we played better defensively but we didn’t have that spark offensively or the jump we usually have.”Following Sunday’s loss, the Canadian mentioned how defensive mistakes cost his team late in the game and how frustrating it is to be on the wrong side of controversial calls.Blaze held a - lead after the first period as Evan Bloodoff capitalised on a Dundee turnover in the eighth minute.However, when both teams went down to four skaters each in the second period, Kevin Dufour put Stars back on level terms as he went clean through on the Coventry goal and dispatched the puck through the legs of Jamie Phillips on the halfway mark.The West Midlands club nicked the two points in the final period as Alex Forbes scored a shorthanded goal in the th minute.Yesterday, Stars were in Yorkshire where they were beaten - by Sheffield Steelers.The scoring was opened when Dundee’s captain Matt Marquardt was in the penalty box for slashing. On the resulting powerplay, Marc-Olivier Vallerand fired a shot into the top-left corner after  minutes.Robert Dowd quickly doubled Steelers’ lead as he batted in the rebound of Ben O’Connor’s shot a minute later.However, the goal was reviewed for a high-stick foul but, after a lot of deliberation, the call on the ice stood, much to the Stars boss Pacha’s frustration.Aaron Fox’s men were in top gear and added a third goal in the th minute as Tanner Eberle pulled the puck around a charging Leclerc and tucked it into the Stars net as he was taken down by the Dundee goaltender.Sheffield held onto their three-goal cushion going into the first break but, early in the second period, the visitors hit back to cut the deficit to - as Brett Stovin was on hand to turn in the rebound of Jagger Dirk’s blocked shot.Pacha’s men were on top for most of the second session and, in the third, Stars closed in again.While on the powerplay, Dundee’s Elgin Pearce pulled one back to make it - on  minutes.The Canadian forward was in space and picked out by Anthony Beauregard before he released a quick shot that flew past Duba and deflected down off the crossbar.The Tayside team were only within one goal of the Steelmen for five minutes as Sheffield restored their two-goal lead after  minutes.Steelers’ Eric Meland released a fast and low shot that hit the leg of Eberle and that was enough to deflect the puck past Leclerc, making it -.Despite Dundee going all out in the final few minutes, the home side held on to claim a - home win.Dundee’s next matches see them face another tough test with a trip to Belfast Giants on Friday night before a home clash against Glasgow Clan on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

However, we will look at the plans more closely to make sure that it will not have a negative effect on parking in the local area.“We are going to have to know more about the plan before we say anything more.”The planning documents state the extension “will not result in parking capacity issues”.The proposals for the expansion at Cineworld come just days after a developer revealed proposals to open a five-screen cinema in Peterhead.The Arc Cinema will open its doors at the former Gala Bingo site on the town’s Marischal Street in December.The Irish cinema operator is investing £ million in converting the building and the scheme secured £, in funding from Aberdeenshire Council’s property investment fund."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/EE-KF-141019-01-02-450x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet lexi lola and harley are looking for a new home can you help1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home. vw, px\"  This sweet girl is nine years old.She’s a friendly pup, but being a little older she doesn’t want to live with young children or other dogs or cats.Lexi loves playing with her toys, especially footballs!

So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year. Since the beginning of , more than , visitors have been recorded as accessing the Tarbert Castle site.Tarbert Harbour Authority manages one of the largest marinas in the Clyde area. Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s.

We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the

They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members will decidefurther consultation and a reconsideration of this isive policy will take place.ldquoI am hoping that elected councillors will put aside their political dferences and respect the wishes of the Hawick and Borders public to make sure our children and young people have safe and secure play areas near their homes."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan-considered-good-royal-family-half-country-says-survey","story":"More than half the country believes the Duchess of Sussex has been good for the Royal Family, according to a survey for Tatler magazine.Meghan has altered the usual course of royal le since marrying the Duke of Sussex in May last year, campaigning for womenrsquos empowerment and environmental conservation.The survey suggests % of adults think she has been good for the monarchy while % disagree.--The Duchess of Sussex on the cover of Tatler --However, only % of respondents expressed an opinion on the question.Tatler and ComRes surveyed , British adults between September  and , with results weighted to be demographically representative of all adults in Great Britain.Some % said they thought Meghan was hypocritical on environmental issues.The duke and his we have faced criticism after taking a number of private jet journeys over the summer, apparently at odds with their views on supporting the environment.--vw,vw,px, px\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have come under fire for their use of private jets --The survey also suggests that % prefer the Duchess of Cambridge to Meghan while % believe Meghan and Harry would be better off moving to Los Angeles.And % of those polled believe the media treat Meghan unfairly while % think that is driven by racism.High society publication Tatlerrsquos th anniversary December issue features an archive photo of Meghan, taken by Janick Laurent, on the cover.It debates ldquoThe Meghan issue, with the cover headline asking ldquoDoes she conquer or ide  and writers such as Lionel Shriver and Lynn Barber ldquotaking sides.The special edition of Tatler is available on news stands and via digital download on Thursday October ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Meghan considered good for Royal Family by over half the country, says survey"},{"url":null,"title":"letter independence march","story":"I didn#t march because my aged legs don#t carry me far these days, but I#m not ashamed to be a supporter of independence.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing.

The wind had a strange mildness in its touch.His grandson was in the joy of the moment, finding shells, climbing rocks and throwing stones into the sea. His grandfather watched, wishing he too could join in the fun. But age had crept up on him. His joints tweaked with pain every time he tried to behave like his younger self, making him very cautious. So he found a rock on which to sit and watched over his grandson as he explored.His thoughts were taken away from the beach and he began to think of his we. She had dearly loved their grandson but sadly she was only an image in a photograph for her grandson now. He was too young when she died to have any real memories of her. It was at moments like this that he missed her most, for she loved the beach. And at night, of course, for he was still unused to sleeping alone after  years of sharing the night with the woman he loved. It didnrsquot seem right, men were supposed to be outlived by women, not left behind like this.Suddenly, his attention was caught by the sight of his grandson wading into the sea, still wearing his shoes and socks.ldquoNo lad, yoursquoll...Too late, he was jumping in the waves, splashing and laughing. His granddad rose from his rock and walked over to him.ldquoCome on granddad, jump the waves with me, he called out, his face beaming with joy. The boyrsquos shoes were now completely soaked, as were the lower part of his trousers. The old man knew he would be in trouble with his daughter for allowing this to happen.

Wave after wave came in and they faced them together.ldquoWe need to go now and get dry and warm up, said his granddad after a while.ldquoJust one more, please!And so they had one more wave jump together and headed for the car, both equally soaked.

I donrsquot believe it, what were you thinking  And now my car will be full of sand.ldquoI was thinking of your mum, he said. ldquoShe loved the beach and jumping the waves when we were young, and so did you when you were wee.ldquoYes, but not with our shoes on! said his daughter angrily, peeling off a sock from her son and pointing to his sodden shoes.ldquoLook at your shoes, dad, yoursquore not a child, you should know better.ldquoIt was so fun, mum, said her son, asto explain the state they were in.When they got back to the house, the granddad went to a cupboard and took out a box.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

Despite the objection of the Democratic Unionist Partyand anti-abortion crusaders, it was ruled that from midnight it would be legal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, as in the Republic of Ireland, as in the rest of the UK.With the passage of this legislation, women in the first  weeks of pregnancy who wish to have a termination will no longer have to skulk out of the country, or purchase online pills, rendering them open to prosecution should these make them so unwell they require medical attention.After next April, following an interim period during which access to services on the mainland will be freely available, the situation in Northern Ireland will change radically. Those who are pregnant as a result of incest or rape those who know their foetus has an incurable disease that will allow them little quality of le for as long as they survive those who have been told they must go full term, even though the baby has died, will finally be given a degree of dignity and comfort. At last, they will be able to end a pregnancy of their own volition, in their homeland, without stigma and with the full support of the medical professionals who tend to them.It is a not a subject for wild rejoicing, as was evident in the sombre response of campaigners on learning the law had been passed. The mood was more of relief than jubilation. Nobody can feel joy at the idea of a pregnancy that, for whatever reason, is better ended.But it is possible to feel gratitude that an old and crippling injustice, a hangover of a puritanical stranglehold on womenrsquos lives, has been overturned. As of now, Northern Irish women are entitled to decide on their own welfare and that of their unborn child. It is a right that is not only legal but ethical.That these new laws are among the most liberal in Europe is remarkable, given the strength and tenacity of opposition to this issue. It must exacerbate the fury of the anti-abortion camp to watch the political mothership in London impose its will with such vigour.That this has happened under a Conservative government with which the DUP was in partnership, is an added grievance. As is the fact that even the Republic of Ireland, once a by-word for religious conservatism, last year voted to allow terminations . This volte face was salt in the wound for pro-lers and pro-choice activists alike.The measure of how historic this landmark will prove can be gauged by the opening of the padlock on the Assemblyrsquos gates. Sinn Fein did not turn up, but Arlene Forster, leader of the DUP, announced that, despite this act, her party would explore ldquoevery possible legal option to prevent the provision of abortion services within their borders.A fuming zealot was less restrained: ldquoin todayrsquos world the most dangerous place to be is actually in the womb of a woman. There could hardly be a more calculated insult to womankind, but the depth of this manrsquos misogyny highlights the intensity of prejudice and oppression with which the pro-choice lobby has had to contend.This momentous step is good news for the United Kingdom, as is impending legislation to allow same-sex marriage from next January. All this is positive. Yet it is a sad day for the Union that both decisions, which will have far-reaching social implications, are not the work of Irish politicians but of Westminster.Since the Assembly collapsed in January , its day to day business has been handled by civil servants. You might argue they are doing such a good job they are enabling Sinn Fein and the DUP to maintain their stand-off. That not even the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee could encourage these parties to put aside their quarrel indicates the bitterness and ision at the heart of Irish politics.Yet while the Assembly has been lying all these months in an induced coma, London has not been idle. Those on the pro-choice side of the debate might have mixed feelings, since their argument has been vindicated thanks to action by the English. Time was when anything that came out of Westminster was regarded in certain quarters as toxic. How ironic, then, that the Assemblyrsquos denizens have allowed their internal wrangling, their myopia and obstinacy, to allow an often loathed overlord to step into their shoes and usher voters into a more compassionate age.That must be galling for everyone.

For many undecided Scottish voters this sort of alternative appears to appeal ndash it avoids the big leap while still rejecting arrangements as they are today.But federalisation or any form of a signicantly re-imagined UK is never going to happen. My experiences as an undergraduate at Oxford taught me at least that much. The English elite simply have no interest in a radical reform. While the discourse along this theme rages on north of the Border, the silence in the south-east of England roars a definitive ldquono. Sweeping reform simply isnrsquot on the radar. Andit werenrsquot after a heartfelt vow to change was made on the eve of the  poll and % still voted Yes, it is never going to be.:Lobby row Ruth Davidson set up her own consultancy firm  days agoBecause in a ldquoprecious union of nations, as the nauseatingly insincere phrase goes, we would have said that given two nations rejected Brexit and the overall result in that referendum was narrow, we should leave but in a very soft form. A Union that respects the views of all its nations would allow for flexible arrangements where Scotland could have a deal tailored to its needs and respecting its anti-Brexit vote. But no such recognition of national dferences within the UK came Scotlandrsquos way. On Wednesday we even heard from the Prime Minister that the devolved legislatures have no role whatsoever in consenting to the Brexit deal ndash a claim as outrageous as it is erroneous.For most of the southern English who go on to rule the UK roost, Scotland piques interest only for carefully selected performative acts. At Oxford the usual crowd of boys schooled in England with refined English accents and London homes would don their kilts for formal dinners and balls. Burns Night is one such favoured occasion of the Scottish-when-it-suits-me cohort. And then therersquos the annual English middle-class pilgrimage to Edinburgh for the Fringe.Scotland deserves better than the disregard the English demonstrate the rest of the year.As much as our Westminster leaders profess their deep love of the Union, it feels much more like a love of the cultural prestige Scotland affords England and a fear of the symbolic blow to the UK that would come with independence.Better to look at what the UK Government does in relation to Scotland than continue to listen to the endless stream of verbal assurances insisting they care.I do believe the English and Scots have broadly the same values. The talk of Scottish progressiveness has probably been somewhat overdone in a country which in my letime had a private postal ballot on whether to continue banning discussion of gay peoplersquos existence from schools. But that is irrelevant. Where the Scottish and English erge is in voting behaviour. If the UK had not ed a Conservative government driven by English votes in , there never would have been a Brexit referendum that no one outside a rabid fringe was calling for. If the English had voted like the Scottish in that referendum, we would not still potentially be just days away from a catastrophic No-Deal Brexit that no one said was on the cards. But here we are.:MPs could hold Boris Johnson hostage over Brexit dateVoting patterns matter more than the values professed in polling. Voting choices have put us in the dire straits the UK is in today. And a voting choice can extract Scotland from this vicious cycle of disappointment with a UK seemingly hell-bent on damaging not just Scots but everyone  in Britain too.In recent weeks the possibility of border controls between Scotland and England has been raised in the event of independence. Our borders are best when theyrsquore invisible. There is a group which shares that view and has demonstrated its commitment to it through action. Itrsquos the European Union. If controls appear at the Border with an independent Scotlandin the EU, it will only be because the English have chosen not to sign up to the European norm, not because Scotland, like the vast majority of Europe, will have chosen to do so.As an Englishman due tosouth of that Border in February, I can only hope the rest of the UK would re-assess the situation in light of the new realities of a post-independence world and join Scotland and Ireland back in the EU. The choice will be for the rest of the UK to make.I am by no means wedded to the idea of independence. Through serious reform Canada redefined itself after Quebec voted by less than . per cent against splitting off in . Itrsquos an outcome the Queacutebeacutecois seem happy with, as independence is no longer under serious discussion.

He took samples of soil from around east Africa which up until now have been stored in the Museums collections.Dr Darby went through these samples using high powered microscopes to see and then take photos of the tiny beetles that were caught up with the substrate.:Greta Thunbergcould come to Glasgow for UN climate summitHe has been able to describe not only the new species named after Ms Thunberg but also a new genus and eight other new species of Ptiliidae in the same sample.Ms Thunberg has risen to fame for fearless, straight-talking environmental campaign which has seen her in front of world governments and TV screens despite only being .She first came to be known for her skolstrejk foumlr klimatetdemonstration in . Instead of attending school, the then  year old protested outside the Swedish parliament about the lack of action politicians were taking to tackle the climate crisis.Since then the movement has resulted in some of the largest climate strikes in world history, gathering millions of protesters in over  countries worldwide to increase pressure on those in power to act.She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in , which was later awarded to Ethiopias Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.By naming the beetle after Ms Thunberg, Dr Darby said, he \"wanted to acknowledge her outstanding contribution in raising awareness of environmental issues.\"I suspect that this could very well be the first time a species has been named after Greta,\" said Dr Darby. \" I dont know of any other beetle named after her, thats for sure.\"Im really a great fan of Greta. She is a great advocate for saving the planet and she is amazing at doing it, so I thought that this was a good opportunity to recognise that.\"These beetles are so very small that my we has described them as being like animated full stops,\" said Dr Darby. \"But actually many are a whole lot smaller than a full stop.\"Id also like to stress that Ive not named this species after Greta because it is small, its just that this is the group that I work on.\"The beetle has now been featured in Entomologists Monthly Magazine.:Greta Thunberg makes impassioned plea for climate action at UNThey are usually found in the leaf litter and soil, feeding on fungal hyphae and spores. While there are a few dozen species known from the UK alone, in the tropics their ersity is poorly understood.\"The family that I work on are some of the smallest known free-living creatures,\" explained Dr Darby. \"They are not parasitic and are not living inside other creatures. Few of them measure more than a millimetre long.\"It is not the done thing for scientists to name newly discovered species after themselves, but they have the right to choose, and Dr Darby has named several species of Ptiliidae after prominent people, including one for Sir David Attenborough.Theres also a parasite named after Bob Marley , a genus of fish called after Richard Dawkinsand a golden-haired fly named after Beyonce .In December, a blind and burrowing amphibian was officially named Dermophis donaldtrumpi, in recognition of the US presidentrsquos climate change denial.The name was chosen by the boss of EnviroBuild, a sustainable building materials company, who paid ,at an auction for the right. The small legless creature was found in Panama and EnviroBuildrsquos Aidan Bell said its ability to bury its head in the ground matched Donald Trumprsquos approach to global warming.And there is the Prince Charles frog. The tree frog was named after his Royal Highness in  in recognition of his charity work to protect their rainforest habit. Hyloscirtus princecharlesi, or the Prince Charles stream tree frog, was first discovered in Ecuador in .Dr Max Barclay, the museums senior curator in charge of beetles, said the name for the Greta beetle was apt because \"it is likely that undiscovered species are being lost all the time, before scientists have even named them, because of bioersity loss\".\"So it is appropriate to name one of the newest discoveries after someone who has worked so hard to champion the natural world and protect vulnerable species,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"excellent response to call for new members","story":"Dozens of folk have signed up to become Bailies of Bennachie during the first half of October.The conservation group is having a push on membership this month with all new members being entered into a prize draw for a voucher for afternoon tea for two at Pittodrie House Hotel.The group’s outreach officer, Fiona Cormack, explained: “It is wonderful to have had such apositive response so far.“A social media campaign is featuring inidual Bailies saying why they are members.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmA special open day, aimed at showcasing the new Orkney Research and Innovation CampusRobert Rendall building in Stromness, is set to take place on Saturday.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This scheme will include looking at prehistoric seafaring and what the Isles were like thousands of years ago, what travel would have been like between the isles with very dferent sea levels. Shipwrecks will also be considered — uncovering more information about wrecks around the isles, looking at any that might still be unrecorded and sharing anecdotes and stories passed down through families and between friends. One aspect of the project will look at maritime cultural landscapes and how sea links and industries have shaped the character of each isle. Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week. This includes events at Sanday Community School on Monday, October  Westray Junior High on Tuesday, October  St Ann#s Community Room in Papa Westray on Wednesday, October  Eday Heritage Centre on Thursday, October  North Ronaldsay Community Centre on Friday, November  and at the Boathouse in Shapinsay on Saturday, November .Dates in Stronsay and Rousay, Eglisay and Wyre are to be confirmed.For further information, you can contact the North Isles Landscape Partnership Scheme via its Facebook Page.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This further three month delay is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland needed, given the ongoing uncertainty it creates.“It seems that every time Ministers make an announcement the deadline for the new contract gets pushed back.

But unfortunately the price tag was unrealistic for most families, with costs of bikes in the thousands.She said: #Shetland Sport for All wants to keep the momentum going in Shetland and help people to access sport and activity no matter what their ability is.#The group is also in the running for a grant through the #Loot for Lerwick# event this coming Saturday.Ms Murray said: #Please head along to Islesburgh between am and noon and vote for their project to help them get funding to have more adapted bikes in the islands.#The aim of Shetland Sport For All is to bridge the gap for people in Shetland living with a disabilityto be able to access sporting activities to encourage and promote the development of sport and physical recreation among disabled people in Shetland to seek to improve the quality of le and health and fitness of disabled people through participation in sport to strengthen and extend the network of contacts, clubs and development groups throughout Shetland andas a branch of Scottish Disability Sport in accordance with the constitution and aims of that body..."},{"url":null,"title":"ofgem rejects shetland subsea cable plan ","story":"Government regulator Ofgem have said they are #unable to approve# plans to build a subsea electricity transmission cable between Shetland and the mainland, in a further blow to the Viking Energy windfarm development.This comes only a month after Viking failed to win government backing in the latest round of Contract for Dference auctions.In a statement released on Wednesday morning, Ofgem announced that the #award of these subsidies would have provided confidence that the wind farm is likely to progress, and protection for consumers from the risk of paying for an underutilised transmission link to the Shetland Isles.#In March, Ofgem said that they were minded to approve the estimated £ million link between Shetland and the mainland.They have said they #would welcome revised proposals from SSEN including providing greater certainty on the future of the windfarms#.This latest setback is also a blow to the proposed Energy Isles  turbine windfarm development in Yell, which is also reliant on a transmission cable between Shetland and the Scottish mainland going ahead. raquoMy goodness, sanity is taking over at last.

They should have a steady stream of Gaelicspeakers coming through the primary school now, so we’d be delighted to seethem back and entering choral and other competitions.“The same goes for Lochaber, where there is also a Gaelic school, and for Inverness Royal Academy, the school which pupils of Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Inbhir Nis go on to attend.#Mr Morrison added: “It’s often said that youngsters need more opportunity for speaking Gaelic outside of a school setting – and the Mòd should be the ideal  for that.“If Nicolson and Sir E Scott canmanage to come every year, there’s no reason why Portree couldn’t.“We’d love to see them back on stage when the Mòd comes to Inverness next year.”MEANWHILE, singers from Back and Benbecula qualied in first place for Thursday night#s Traditional Gold Medal final.Isabelle Bain, a -year-old postgraduate law student at Glasgow University, won the Moray Trophy in the women#s qualying competition.She has ed to competitive singing after a three year break, and tonight will be her third appearance in the prestigious final.Alasdair Iain MacPhee, from Nunton in Benbecula, leads the men#s competition after winning the Lochaber Rotary Club trophy.The -year-old works as a Gaelic primary teacher at Winhill School in Greenock, and is competing at his first ever Mòd, having been persuaded by his pupils to take part.Both Alasdair and Isabelle scored  out of  and, as a result, they shared the Donald Murray memorial trophyGlasgow gaels also won both of the Gold Medal singing competitions held om Wednesday.The men#s Gold Medal was won by Ruairidh Alasdair MacLennan, a BBC reporter from Glasgow, but with family connections to South Uist.The women#s prize was won by teacher Clare MacAulay, originally from Ness in Lewis."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2889.jpg","title":"premier mod choral prize for back gaelic choir in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCòisir Sgire a# Bhac # Back Gaelic Choir # enjoyed a day of success during Thursday#s rural choral competitions at the Royal National Mòd in Glasgow The Lewis choristers won the Lorn Shield, with fellow islanders Carloway and Lochs completing the contest#s top three.Bùrach, a choir mainly from the Morvern area, won the Sherf MacMaster memorial quaich.It is the third year in succession that the choir, led by Riona Whyte, has won the coveted prize.competition.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

He said: “With the Hallowe’en break upon us, there still unfortunately remains the threat from large volumes of often illegal fireworks in the countryside.  “These illegal fireworks, and especially the loud banger types, still pose a considerable threat to farm livestock. “In my capacity as Constituency MLA, I have welcomed any past seizures in by the police of any amounts of illegal fireworks which could have caused injury not just to others but also to the users. “I appeal to the community thatthey have any knowledge of these types of attacks to give the information as soon as possible to the police so that these people can be brought before the courts and face the due process of the law. “I also appeal to parents to ensure they know that their children are doing. Attacks on live stock are an open attack on the farmer’s livelihood and assets.  “And it’s not just farm animals which have suffered under the threat of the so-called Banger Menace.  “As a community, we have a moral duty to assist the police and the courts in eradicating the threats to le and physical attacks from these Hallowe’en Hoods.  “These socially sick iniduals often get their kicks by intimidating the more vulnerable in our society. As a community, we cannot afford to wait until a flock or herd is burned alive before taking action to help the forces of law and order stamp out the Banger Menace. “As a community, we must not be flippant about the threat of fire dangers to barns and bales, especially with the high costs of replacement fodder for the upcoming winter,” said Assemblyman Swann.

Is it a bird  Is it a plane  No, it’s a hawk-shaped kite designed to scare away seagulls and other sky-borne nuisances. Graciously circling overhead like birds of prey on the hunt, two faux hawks are simply attached to a line and pole, which is mounted to the roof of the fast food restaurant, rising and falling with every change in the wind. Passers-by could be forgiven for being startled when the kite is whipped into action by a gentle breeze that helps keep the seagulls at bay . Historically, seagulls have lived near the sea or sometimes beside rivers and reservoirs, but they have increasingly been found in inland towns and cities where they are often viewed as pests by the urban population.The problem is made worse by the fact that the main culprit is the herring gull – one of the largest and most aggressive members of the gull family on the island of Ireland.One reason for the growth in the number of gulls is the relative safety for the birds of perches atop man-made structures, where gulls commonly build their nests out of the reach of predators.Another reasons that gulls have moved inland is the abundant supply of food waste, which helps sustain them. No surprise, then, that they might flock to supermarkets, shops and food outlets like McDonald’s.While retailers, local government authorities, and restaurants have been keen to limit the birds’ access to food waste by using lidded bins and encouraging proper disposal, the urban gull perseveres. The daring and intelligent birds have been known to swoop down on humans to snatch food from their hands – an obvious danger when you’re trying to eat a Big Mac. While the law makes it illegal to recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents, it does, in the interest of health and safety, make allowances for certain control measures, and there are few more clever – or more humane – than the kite hawk. The urban gulls have been the subject of human concern leading, in some cases, to lethal methods of control. However, given that they are a red-list threatened species, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds questions the use of lethal control as a means of dealing with the issue.A less aggressive method of control – like that employed by McDonald’s at Westwoods – is just one solution that may help our co-habitation. At the very least, your McNuggets are somewhat safer."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"welsh fm%e2%80%88calls for bridge building at belfast","story":"THE First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford AM was in Belfast on Friday when he appealed for bridge-building across the Irish Sea despite the headwinds of Brexit.The Welsh premier made the appeal at the gala banquet of the Belfast International Homecoming in City Hall.He also said he was envious of the strong global Irish American networks – which were represented at the three day Homecoming event which showcased the best of Belfast to the Irish diaspora.Mr Drakeford praised the “well organised diaspora” of Ireland and Scotland for promoting their country’s “practical interests around the globe”, but called for better self-organisation to protect Welsh interests in the context of Brexit.“There are Welsh people, too, around the world,” he said.“They are just as passionate about their identity and the home from which they have sprung – but they don’t yet operate in that organised way we see in this room.“For us, that means we have to work harder – and harder still in the headwinds of Brexit – to sustain our profile and our unique identity on the international stage. Since I became First Minister, in December last year, we have an International Relations Minister in our Cabinet – an idea completely unthinkeable at the start of devolution. We have a highly regarded International Strategy, which is being discussed and debated across Wales.”Mr Drakeford stressed the importance of forging links between people on “dferent sides of the Irish Sea”, particularly those from “Celtic nations”.“Amongst us all are links of language, of history, of culture, of economic identity and, in many instances of progressive political outlook,” he said.“We all share the presence of a powerful neighbour, with a global and dominant language and a well-developed sense of its own signicance. In the Brexit context – and beyond it too – we have had the best results, I believe, when we have been able to work together, in an informal Celtic alliance, to provide a more powerful counterweight to hard line leave propositions than we could have mobilised working on our own.“And in the dficult days ahead, I think the effort to identy common interests, to act with a sense of solidarity in their pursuit, and to create outcomes which work for us all – that effort will be needed as never before.”"},{"url":null,"title":"european union free to promote irish unity sinn fein mep claims","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I said so at the time.“Because you can’t use the threat of violence to achieve something.“And that unfortunately now has set a precedent where people from loyalism are looking at that, and they’re saying ‘hold on a second, he used that in that particular way, so now we’re going to use that’.“That’s wrong. That is not the way forward.”Ms Foster said loyalist concerns about the Brexit deal were understandable.“I am not dismissing, and I want to be very clear on this, fears and concerns of the loyalist community, or indeed unionist middle class people, or anybody in unionism at the moment, because actually unionism and loyalism are all at one relation to this deal – they are rejecting it,” she said.“So instead of talking about loyalist violence in relation to that, let’s deal with those fears.“And let’s deal with those concerns in a way that addresses them.“And the way to do that, of course, is to try and deal with those issues aroundconsent and the concerns that we have around customs.”In response to Ms Foster’s remarks, a spokesman for the Taoiseach said: “The Irish Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.“Protecting peace on the island of Ireland has and always will be our overriding objective.“It should be clear to everyone that Brexit itself has disturbed the political equilibrium in Northern Ireland.“It’s the main reason why the Irish Government was against it.“We have never wanted any new borders neither North-South nor in the Irish Sea.“Unfortunately, leaving the EU customs union and single market requires that checks must now happen somewhere.”"},{"url":null,"title":"man barricades himself in room as masked men ransacked belfast home","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was rejected by Dublin.The proposal is outlined in a new book, Inside Accounts, by University of Portsmouth academic Dr Graham Spencer.In an interview with the author, Mr Lillis describes the border plan as \"a sort of crazy British proposal, although not a random one\" as it was Cabinet-approved.The proposal was rejected by Dublin because while the Garda and Irish Army were universally popular with their public, the same was not true of the security forces in Northern Ireland.\"For virtually one half of the population, the army is regarded as an occupying force, while for the other half its regarded as our army and, while the RUC was seen as our police force for unionists, for nationalists it was an oppressive, foreign police force,\" Mr Lillis said.\"Because of that, the idea of having those people on our side of the border, when they were regarded as oppressors of nationalists in the north, was unthinkable.\"Even so, Armstrong and Goodall came over to the taoiseachs department and they made this proposal in writing.\"It wasnt just Mrs Thatcher and it wasnt just the foreign secretary it was a Cabinet-approved proposal, as well.\"Mr Lillis said he thought the proposal was \"remarkable\" because the Republic would \"have our folks on the other side of the border, working in nationalist areas inside the north ... although we had no interest in having the RUC in Co Monaghan, we had nevertheless broken a mould\".He added: \"If you consider the Cabinet saying to these foreigners, Come in to our territory and help us to solve this chaotic situation, well that was a big deal.

Hes a little bit eccentric, a little bit alternative,\" he said.The two leaders have been in regular contact as they try and thrash out a Brexit deal.The Irish Unity debate has come to the fore as politicians on both sides of the Irish sea struggle to reconcile Brexit and honouring commitments made in the Belfast Agreement which brought peace to Northern Ireland.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle ONeill said earlier this week that a border poll will happen sooner than anticipated due to the Brexit upheaval.Sinn Fein have previously said they wanted a border poll on a United Ireland within five years, but Ms O’Neill said Brexit could see it happening sooner.A recent poll, published by Lord Ashcroft in September, found that % of those surveyed would want to stay in the UK, while % said they would vote to leave and join the Republic of Ireland.The figures break down to % to % for unication when those who dont know and others who say they would not vote are excluded.However, unionists and loyalist have begun mobilising to oppose the Prime Ministers Brexit deal agreed with the EU earlier this month.Proponents of the union have said the deal would cut Northern Ireland off from Britain and eventually lead to a united Ireland.Loyalists in Belfast held a meeting on Monday night to warn Boris Johnson that they \"will not tolerate an economic united Ireland\".Spokesman Jamie Bryson said there is “immense anger” within loyalism around the current proposed Brexit deal.\"If this deal passes, there will be mass resistance from the unionist community,\" Mr Bryson said. \"There are many dferent views on what form it will take.\"The PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said any Brexit deal - that threatens the union between GB and NI could lead to civil disorder from loyalists quarters."},{"url":null,"title":"tobacco ban for belfast shop which sold cigarettes to child","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The index ended within .% of its record set on July . It also notched its third straight weekly gain.Strong earnings reports from Intel, Charter Communications and other companies helped reverse a mixed start.The buying accelerated around midday after the US Trade Representative’s office said the discussions with China’s negotiating team “made headway and the two sides are close to finalising some sections of the agreement.”“You’ve had indexes around the world make new highs since the last time the SP did,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. “If we want to see a new high that’s going to be durable we need to see more US broad market improvement.

That is slightly better than the % drop that analysts were initially expecting.As of Friday, some  companies in the SP  had issued earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter.

The delay is due to issues relating to routine testing of the Fluenz Tetra nasal flu vaccine by the manufacturer and is not related to the safety or the efficacy of the vaccine. Work is under way to minimise potential disruption to the childhood flu immunisation programme in the Northcaused by this. In line with the rest of the UK the Chief Medical Officer has requested GP’s prioritise children with underlying health conditions and pre-schoolers over the age of two. googletag.cmd.push Dr Gerry Waldron, Assistant Director of Public Healthat the PHA, said: “We have been exploring how to best use the available stock based on evidence and clinical advice, and taking into account projections on the revised delivery schedule to maximise protection in the community. “Practices will continue to offer the vaccine to pre-schoolers and children in at risk groups as normal. The school vaccination programme is currently continuing as normal. Pupils at special schools have already received their vaccine. “However, the disruption to supply may lead to vaccinations in some primary schools being rescheduled, but all eligible children will have an opportunity to receive their vaccine. “Whilst this situation is unfortunate, it is completely outside our control and we would continue to urge eligible people to get vaccinated, as we know this is the best way to protect against the flu. Parents of at-risk children and pre-schoolers should make themselves aware of their own GP surgery’s flu vaccination arrangements.” This issue does not impact on the adult flu vaccination programme, and we encourage all adults who are eligible to receive the flu vaccine to get it. This will not only help to protect them, but will also help to reduce the impact of flu in the wider community.

Both teams are no strangers to the Paul McGirr tournament either with Burren’s latest visit being last year where they were defeated narrowly in the semi final by Lavey, they have fonder memories of the tournament however from  when they won it with a team from which many of the players have already progressed onto their senior team which won last year’s Down title. googletag.cmd.push This season Burren’s success has continued having blitzed their way through the Down league and championship culminating in a - to - victory over Bredagh in the championship final. With  of their starting team from last year’s Paul McGirr campaign there is no doubt that Burren are the team to beat this year. James Kelly, Patrick McCarthy and Ryan Magill backbone a talented defence, Odhran Murdock and Conlin Bradley will be looking to dominate proceedings in midfield while up front James Duggan, Zach Murdock and Eoin Loughran are all noted score getters. However their talisman Niall Toner is the man the Derry champions will really have to look out for, his displays in the tournament last year were breathtaking to say the least and there is no doubt he will have a major bearing on the contest. Lead coach Neil Coulter feels his preparations have been hindered somewhat but is looking forward to the occasion ‘Burren are delighted to be once again representing Down in this year’s Paul McGirr Ulster Tournament, preparations have been tough going as  of our players were involved with the minor’s in last Sunday’s championship final replay so getting them together this past few weeks hasn’t been easy, however we are really looking forward to Saturday’s game against Magherafelt, it is a repeat of the Feacuteile finals and will be a really tough battle.’ Magherafelt are a club that’s riding on a crest of a wave at the minute with this week being one of the most memorable in the south Derry club’s history, adding the Derry U title to their historic senior victory last weekend. Wednesday evenings - to - victory over a fancied Lavey in wet and windy conditions was met with great euphoria and Enda Qunn’s men will be looking to take that momentum into Saturday’s fixture. They won’t have had much time to recover but they are a side laced with quality, Luke McCann and Eoin McEvoy the fulcrum of a solid defence with McCann likely being given the unenviable task of keeping tabs on Toner. Cormac Bateson and Dan Higgins form a very solid midfield partnership and up front they have their own talisman in Daragh Wade who was part of last season’s Derry minor . This game has the potential to be one of the best in the long history of the Paul McGirr tournament and no doubt both clubs will bring a huge support with them for the fixture. It is an intriguing match up with both sides being used to success and being very familiar with each other. Magherafelt will definitely not be ring rusty but may feel the effects of their draining battle with Lavey on Wednesday night. The hurt of having lost out to Lavey in last years semi final should give Burren that bit of an extra incentive and this could well tip the scales in their favour, either way whoever emerges from the tie will be favourites to annex the  Paul McGirr title.

We must’ve had a least a  minute phone-call with him saying ‘you’re doing nets’ and me saying ‘no’ but sure look where I am at now and I’m happy about it,” the imposing Magherafelt custodian utters with a smile. “I’ll take it.”For the last two weeks, Barry Gillis worked intently with Lynch ahead of the biggest day in the clubs history for  years.He kicked ball through the eye of a needle almost and made himself impassable when an Ethan Doherty goal would’ve opened a four point lead in the first-half.As well as that, his handling was impeccable as stray, wind-assisted balls dropped in on top of him in the second-half.How does a young player deal with pressure “You expect the pressure, that’s what comes from being in nets. If somebody outfield drops the ball, somebody  picks it up. If I drop the ball, it’s a goal. You saw it yourself a few games ago . I have played in a few big games but nothing like this. In the big games, you know what to expect.”At one point in the second-half he took off on a foray into the midfield zone. It’s impossible to clip his wings all the time.“You play with a bit of freedom as well. I get to go on wee runs but they don’t want too many of them. You’re the th man and whenever everyone  is wrecked out the pitch, you are fresh and get to go.”Lynch comes into the senior setup with a contingent of their U winning team and they have fitted like a glove.There is a buzz in the camp and their celebrations, with their tops off, in a local hostelry after their win over Coleraine only galvanised them.“They have been off ever since,” Lynch joked.The togetherness has been fostered by the management team.“It is a great squad to be part of,” he adds. “Cush, Baggio , QBand Tomare very involved. They are close together.”There is another attraction in the senior camp for Lynch. The chance to play alongside those he looked up to.“Danny , Chief – I grew up beside Jared and grew up watching him and that’s what you want to be, now I have the chance to play beside him.“Joe Keenan retired four years ago, took two years out and now he is back flying fit and came on there today. It’s great to get a chance to play with the boys you looked up to.”The Rossa ‘keeper jersey is in safe hands. googletag.cmd.push   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sean O’Connor moved on to Armstrong to shut down his threat, while Marty Donaghy’s influence waned after he sustained an arm injury.In contrast, Foreglen only grew in confidence as time ticked on, with Mark McCormick and Kevin O’Connor clinical from the dead ball, while Ciaran McFeely made a huge impact off the bench. googletag.cmd.push BREATHLESSClaudy made two changes to their listed team, with Callum McElhinney in at full-back for Cory Armstrong – tasked with picking up Kevin O’Connor – while Conall White was in for the injured Shane McGahon, acting as the sweeper alongside Stephen Farren and pushing Paddy Hargan into midfield on Mark McCormick alongside Eoin McGahon.Caolaacuten and Cahir O’Connor were the men inside for Foreglen, watched by Fionain Smyth and Jamie Brown respectively, and it allowed Kevin to pull out and create the space with his movement.Conor Johnston squared up to Kevy Dunne, but also acted as the plug in the centre of defence alongside McGahon to stop Oisin Duffy’s runs from deep – with Marty Donaghy pulling out onto the ’ to add his experience.Shea Kerrigan started as the lone man inside, with Cathal O’Hara doing the marking, but Claudy rotated the play – with Aaron Kerrigan and ‘Nugget’ both moving in there at dferent times.With the wind in their favour, the men in blue opened the scoring with two minutes gone, with Marty Donaghy spraying a crossfield pass to younger brother Aaron, and he had time and space inside the ’ to turn inside and chip a right-footed effort over the bar. Aaron Kerrigan doubled the advantage on four minutes with a well-struck free off the ground from the right sideline after Paddy Hargan was fouled.It was the tried and trusted who got Foreglen on the board seconds later when a quick burst of pace through the middle saw Oisin Duffy feed Kevin O’Connor, and he turned away from Callum McElhinney before pointing.A patient O’Brien’s move was ended with a Conal White interception, and it sent the Mitchel’s away. Marty Donaghy took possession on his own ’ and ran all the way into the Foreglen half before palming off the attentions of Eoghan Duffy and sending over a fantastic score – - to -.Pauric Morahan was next to show his pace as he evaded Stephen Farren and Aaron Donaghy down the right before finding Caolan O’Connor, but his attempt from  metres was controversially waved wide.Foreglen were enjoying a period of pressure after a slow start, and they reduced the gap to one on  minutes when a Morahan free was worked into the corner, and Cahir O’Connor turned away from Jamie Brown before fisting over from the angle, with the goal on.Aaron Kerrigan took his tally to two in the th minute when Paddy Hargan recovered after an initial fumble to get the ball through to the forward ahead of McCormick – who wanted the foul in midfield – but Kerrigan advanced on goal and chipped it beautully over the bar while off balance.Oisin Duffy’s runs from deep were being thwarted well early on, but he was stopped illegally by a heavy hit from Stephen Farren on the quarter hour mark. Barry Cassidy played the advantage and Liam O’Hara picked out Kevin O’Connor for the score – - to -.The game was levelled for the first time on  minutes when O’Connor won a soft free off Hargan on the  metre line, and the experienced forward dusted himself down to split the sticks.Claudy regained the lead three minutes later however, when Armstrong took a pass from Marty Donaghy and, despite having his arm pulled, managed to spin around and send one over from  metres off the left – - to -.He followed it up with a free after Eoin McGahon claimed the kick-out and Aaron Donaghy’s initial effort was well blocked down by James O’Kane before Armstrong was fouled, and converted.Another soft free in the Claudy defence after Fionain Smyth had initially won the turnover allowed O’Connor to take his tally to - and make it - to - on the board.Kevin then had the ball in the net after an initial Caolan O’Connor shot came back off the post, but it was ruled out as Cassidy had blown for a free. Mark McCormick slotted it over the top and, once again, it was a level playing field.Foreglen then took the lead for the first time in the final minute of normal time when patient play ended with McCormick fisting over the top for John Duffy in space, and he popped it over from  metres – issuing a cry into the ear of McGahon in celebration.The lead lasted just  seconds though as Hargan was fouled at the other end and the impressive Armstrong was on target with the free from the right.He was the man in form for Claudy, and he grabbed his fourth in added time when he latched on to a brilliant Aaron Kerrigan pass and sent it over off his weaker right foot to give the Mitchel’s the slimmest of leads at the break. Half-time:Claudy -Foreglen -  Pauric Morahan was moved into the half forward line at the start of the second-half on Blaine Carlin, with Sean O’Connor on Oran Armstrong.A pull from Jamie Brown on the shirt of Cahir O’Connor after he beat him for pace down the right allowed Mark McCormick to level things again within two minutes of the restart.The first manic moment came on  minutes when Marty Donaghy rode a heavy hit to feed Aaron, and his shot was batted down by Tiarnan Burke on the line and gathered in by John Duffy to prevent Conall White having an easy finish to the net.The Mitchel’s edged ahead again on  minutes and no surprise it was off the boot of Armstrong who curled a free off the ground and just over the bar, despite the efforts of McCormick on the line – - to -, but Claudy’s last.An Eoghan Duffy score after James O’Kane won the break from a Reilly kick-out came before Hargan struck the outside of the post after a fine Claudy move that started with some excellent skill from substitute Jamie Donaghy.Ciaran McFeely was also enjoying an influence off the bench, and he picked a pass in midfield to Kevin O’Connor who took a high tackle from McElhinney and opened his second-half account from the free after  minutes – - to - to Foreglen.The O’Brien’s stretched their lead to two for the first time in the game with  minutes left, when Caolan O’Connor was hacked down by Hargan but managed to get it away to Kevin for the point.The gap was three on  minutes when Aaron Kerrigan hesitated at one end and sent the ball wide, and from the kick-out Ciaran McFeely won the break and immediately looked for Kevin O’Connor. He found Liam O’Hara off the shoulder who chipped over the bar from ten metres – - to -.Foreglen’s dominance continued heading into added time as Eoghan Duffy found acres of space on the  metre line to stick it over the bar, followed by a super McCormick free from the right sideline.It was the midfielder who got the last score of the final with another free to signal wild celebrations from the green and gold.

Ref: Barry Cassidy .  MAN OF THE MATCHEoghan Duffy – Foreglen were resilient as a team in the first-half, but in the second they came to le – and a lot of it was down to Eoghan Duffy. He was everywhere, first to the ball, powerful on the run, and scored two super points. TURNING POINTChanges – When both teams needed to switch it up and break the cycle, it was Foreglen’s bench that proved the dference. Ciaran McFeely entered the fray after  minutes and took control in midfield to assert the Foreglen dominance. SCORE OF THE GAMEDonaghy point – It was only the one score for Marty Donaghy on the day, but it was typically brilliant. He took the ball inside his own half, ran the guts of  metres and then fired over on the spin, despite being under a lot of pressure.

Or perhaps he just couldn’t quite believe what he was seeing.“We were talking about doing it for the parish during a meeting on Saturday and there was a video of near enough everybody in the community wishing us well and wishing everybody good luck – whether it was brothers, sisters, friends, mums, dads, children, everyone was on it,” Duffy told the County Derry Post. “It’s not about us, it’s not about the players, it’s everybody in the community and in the club house we celebrate it together. “Winning championships is great, I love it, but I only love it because it brings everybody together, the whole community, and that’s what it’s all about.” googletag.cmd.push RUB OF THE GREENIn a game that was so nip and tuck in the first half, with Foreglen leading for less than a minute and down a point at the break, Duffy said they believed in their plan all the way, with the underdogs tag only adding incentive.“To be honest I found it a bit bizarre how strong of favourites Claudy were against us. Nobody really gave us a chance,” stated the defender. “Somebody told me that the bookies had us at   and they were odds on favourites, but nobody in our changing room would have had them as that. “We knew the depth of our squad, the players that we had to come in there, and the competition for places. We knew it was going to be a tight game, we knew it was going to be  , but maybe that added a wee bit of incentive – the fact that nobody gave us a chance.”He continued: “We got in there at half-time and we knew there was a big wind and thatwe held our shape as best we could in the second half then we would be hard to live with, and it worked out that way. “We just set up really well at the back and then had the  to break forward. I saw halfway through the second half as well that Marty Donaghy was holding his arm, so it was probably a big loss to Claudy offensively when he wasn’t firing on all cylinders with the injury. “Again, you get the rub of the green some days. Big Mark McCormick hit two wonder scores from the sideline and whenever those go over you know it’s going to be your day, so we’re delighted.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Co-written withRTEacutebroadcasterJoe DuffyChildrenof the Troubles tells the story of  children aged  and under who died in the conflict between  and .Based on original interviews with almost  families, as well as extensive archival research it has an account about each victim and how they died.Mr Duffy had the idea for Children of the Troubles when he was working on his  book Children of the Rising and on hearing aboutFreya, who is Northern corespondent for the , asked her to get on board.It was a much bigger project than I think either of us realised, she admittedThere was so much research and so many interviews in the last year in particular.The pair painstakingly scoured newspapers and contacted victim supportgroups to help compile the book.You do wonder of there are any children we havent heard of, said MsMcClements.There may well be others whose deaths werent made public.That is why we did a lot of public appeals too through newspapers like the Derry News, asking families to come forward.Tragically, some of the children in the book have no surviving relatives.We have children in the book and there are some families that we werent bale to get in contact with.Some didnt have any survivingfamily and it was really sad as no one was able to speak on their behalf.There were also some families who didnt wish to speak, but they all wished us well with the book.For some of the families it was the first time they had spoken publicly about their loved one.We were very mindful that we were asking people about probably the worst thing that could ever happen to someone, continuedFreya.It was still very painful for them to revisit it.People said that we would be bringing things up for the families, but they said that was completely untrue because this is something they think about every single day.As a journalist I would always say its not about me, its about the families but you wouldnt be humanyou werent affected.There was one mother in particular, who I wont name, and we were just hugging each other.Joe andFreyaset out to show people who these children were.We very deliberately always started with something about the child, she explained.Sometimes there is a tendency in journalism to talk about the incident rather than the inidual.So we talked about the boy who wanted to be a priest or who loved playing outside.We made it something about them.You feel you get to know the children as people.What they liked to do, what they wanted to be when they grew up.The resulting book pays tribute to these young lives andFreyasays she is proud of what they have achieved.As a journalist I write a lot of things and then they are in tomorrows paper and then they are gone.But this feels a lot more permanent.All those children should still have been alive today and I would like to think people will come away with a sense of that.Even bringing the families togetherfor the launch felt signicant.The publication of the book has also led to talk of a permanent memorial for child victims of the Troubles.I would be led by the families in that, saidFreya.If it was something they thought they would like to see then I would be delighted for them.One of the things that Joe and I felt was remarkable was that there wasnt even a complete list of all the children that had died, and now they are talking about remembering them and I think that is very signicant.Its fantastic that conversation has got going. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When I was doing my GCSE’s and AS’s, nothing was too much bother for them. “The whole school community in St Brigid’s is very friendly and welcoming,” said Caacuteit with a smile.According to Gerry the whole family was “really proud” of Caacuteit’s achievement.He said: “Caacuteit’s mammy and I and her brothers, Miacuteċeaacutel Piaras and Ultaacuten Rua, were really proud when we heard Caacuteit had been made Head Girl of St Brigid’s. googletag.cmd.push “It is a fantastic school, with brilliant staff and pupils, where she is thriving. Also, because St Brigid’s offers Irish medium education and has promoted Gaeilge under the current principal, Mr Oacute Mianaacutein, and his predecessor, Dr OacuteCuinneagaacutein, Caacuteit, who is bilingual, was encouraged to use her Irish from day one.“The whole family was pleased. We had a long association with the school, so it meant a lot. Caacuteits uncles, Miacuteċeaacutel, John and Michael and her aunt, Clare, are all St Brigid’s past pupils.”Reflecting on his time at St Brigids College, Gerry said: “The recent sad passing of Mr Brian Rainey, who was vice-principal throughout my seven years at the school, gave me great pause for thought.“In September , I left St Brigids for Queens University, Belfast, thanks to many fine people in that school community and their incredible teaching, encouragement and belief in me. I was not alone, however, further and higher education was a path lots more St Brigid’s students were to take in the years that followed and continue to do so to this day, which is good to see.“I will always be thankful to the wonderful people in St Brigid’s who enabled me to get to where I am today, especially Marianna Doherty, George Chambers and Charlie Doherty, who taught me A’ Level Physics and Maths. Not forgetting the famous ‘Bun Brigade’, Jim Zammit and John Christie.“That is not to mention, Catherine Boyle, Mairead McShane, Ms Coyle and Ms BradleyOwen McColganDan O’Reilly, Liam Gallagher and Tony Carlin, for the shows, especially ‘Dracula Spectacular’ Adrian Brothers and Kevin RaffertyBrendan Burns, Mr McNally, Dave Simpson and Ms HayeWillie BradleyDeirdre DohertyMs FryEd Henryand Piaras Mellon . Last but not least, Harry Sharkey and Mickey McGrath,” said Gerry.“Apologies to anyone I might not have remembered, you were all a great bunch, whose invaluable encouragement and advice, given to me from my first year to my last, allowed me the space to develop into the person I am today,” said a thoughtful Gerry.

Last season Academy vied with Limavady and Clogher Valley for top spot in the league all year so Limavady expected a dficult encounter.Limavady got off to a bright start which resulted in Ben Riley scoring from a fine inidual effort when he broke clear from the half way line to touch down under the posts Luke Faulkner converted. For most of the first half the game was tightly fought until the th minute when Stewart Roddy ran in a score following good work from Luke Montgomery. Luke Faulkner again converted. Just before half time Limavady scored two further tries which effectively killed the game off. Following a good break from Peter Wilson at scrum half Ben Riley was on his shoulder to take the try scoring pass. The bonus point try came when captain Jody McMurray spotted that the home defence had gone to sleep when he coolly strolled in under the posts. Luke again converted to take the half time score to . in Limavady’s favour.The second half continued in much the same vein. Limavady scored first when Peter Wilson broke from the ten metre line to outpace the home defence and score in the corner. Luke Faulkner, in excellent form with the boot this year, once again stepped up with the conversion.Academy managed to hit back with a try of their own, however it was only a matter of time until Limavady would score again. Gavin Martin, now playing in the out half position, managed to make a break and fed Stewart Roddy for his second try of the game. Try number seven came as a result of a long clearance kick from Luke Faulkner which was brilliantly chased down by Stewart Roddy. Putting pressure on Academy’s last line of defence Roddy managed to secure ball and fed inside to Stuart Morrow following up in support. Jody McMurray converted.The only other score was a late consolation effort by Academy when they again crossed in the corner.To top off an excellent day Limavady nds also won convincingly . with tries from Jason Kerr , JamieMillar , Aaron Reilly , John Purcell, Jack Elliott, and Harry McAleese. Harry converted nine of these ten tries.No fixtures for either side next week. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last season Academy vied with Limavady and Clogher Valley for top spot in the league all year so Limavady expected a dficult encounter.Limavady got off to a bright start which resulted in Ben Riley scoring from a fine inidual effort when he broke clear from the half way line to touch down under the posts Luke Faulkner converted. For most of the first half the game was tightly fought until the th minute when Stewart Roddy ran in a score following good work from Luke Montgomery. Luke Faulkner again converted. Just before half time Limavady scored two further tries which effectively killed the game off. Following a good break from Peter Wilson at scrum half Ben Riley was on his shoulder to take the try scoring pass. The bonus point try came when captain Jody McMurray spotted that the home defence had gone to sleep when he coolly strolled in under the posts. Luke again converted to take the half time score to . in Limavady’s favour.The second half continued in much the same vein. Limavady scored first when Peter Wilson broke from the ten metre line to outpace the home defence and score in the corner. Luke Faulkner, in excellent form with the boot this year, once again stepped up with the conversion.Academy managed to hit back with a try of their own, however it was only a matter of time until Limavady would score again. Gavin Martin, now playing in the out half position, managed to make a break and fed Stewart Roddy for his second try of the game. Try number seven came as a result of a long clearance kick from Luke Faulkner which was brilliantly chased down by Stewart Roddy. Putting pressure on Academy’s last line of defence Roddy managed to secure ball and fed inside to Stuart Morrow following up in support. Jody McMurray converted.The only other score was a late consolation effort by Academy when they again crossed in the corner.To top off an excellent day Limavady nds also won convincingly . with tries from Jason Kerr , JamieMillar , Aaron Reilly , John Purcell, Jack Elliott, and Harry McAleese. Harry converted nine of these ten tries.No fixtures for either side next week. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area. The le of a Murlough AC member is indeed a good one and already planning has begun for the next Major.Meanwhile, the week before, Kieran McShane made the long trek to Australia to complete in the Melbourne Marathon.The race began with an early am start along Batman Avenue in the glorious sunshine. This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade.

Letter to the editorAs Ben Lowry asserted in his column ‘Middle England chose Brexit over NI fully in UK,’ October , Boris Johnson’s loyalty is first and foremost to the Conservative party and its English electorate. It was always going to be the case and therein lies the harsh lesson for unionism to learn . It is imperative that unionists consolidate and ensure that maintaining the Union remains in our own hands. That is the battle line drawn for the next election when unionists bite the bullet andthe maximum number of MPs possible to hold firm for the unionist cause .We have been here before with shyster prime ministers and survived. This time we now know in advance where we all stand in terms of having our unionism undermined. What unionism requires are cool heads, sharp minds and positive leadership as never before . Solidarity tied into a unity of defence and purpose in upholding the integrity of the Union and reasserting our right to self determination is the number one unionist priority.David McNarry, Comber©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Carrickrsquos Gin Palace inSessions finalA cracking young band with a strong Carrickfergus influence are aiming to be Northern Ireland#s newest music sensation.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections. We must resist Tory attempts to close down our democracy. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations.

This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year.
