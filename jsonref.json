Here, Beth Hale reveals the stories behind some of the iconic frocks on show.The creation fit for a princess   She called it her ‘favourite dress of all’.And in the flesh, the fabulous fairytale gown Princess Margaret wore to mark her 21st birthday — both her birthday party in August 1951 and portraits — is indeed a dress of dreams.While the diaphanous skirt is not quite as voluminous as photographs suggest and the colour an off-white rather than the lighter, brighter colour of the famous Cecil Beaton photographs, the dress is the kind of flouncing, bare-shouldered perfection that little girls imagine when they dream of princesses (although Margaret’s father George VI was rumoured to have disapproved of it).          Royal Portrait of Princess Margaret on her 21st birthday by Cecil Beaton in a dress designed by Christian Dior, part of the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the London attraction which runs from February 2 to 14 JulyThe differences are not due to any deterioration in fabric, but rather that the colour version of the portrait was actually painted.Even in the Fifties photographers were not averse to a little creative license.With a waist of miniature proportions (no measurement is provided, but it has to be less than 20 inches), the gown shows quite how petite the princess was.Dr Luke says Lady Gaga accused him of rape to win an Oscar...JANET STREET-PORTER: Sorry, Piers but I\u0027m with Will Young -...Could the queen of clean turn me into a domestic god?: MARK...Share this articleMargaret’s son, Lord Snowdon, was at the V\u0026ampA gala dinner to celebrate the exhibition and gave a toast, recalling how surprised he was to find his mother’s dress in the show. He said: ‘I had never seen it before and couldn’t believe that it has survived all these years and been conserved.‘Interestingly, the Cecil Beaton photograph of her shows the dress looking white when in reality it is between cream and beige. It was moving to see the dress that she wore all those years ago with its tiny waist and extraordinary lines, typical of Dior who made such a genius contribution to fashion.’          Princess Diana arrives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Diana was attending the Museum\u0027s 1996 Costume Insitute gala, a tribute to the achievements of designer Christian DiorLord Snowdon, whose wife Serena was dressed in Dior, added: ‘This is an important exhibition for Britain, with an Anglophile designer who showed such elegance and eloquence in fashion design.’Dior admired Princess Margaret’s style, describing her as ‘so very charming’.‘She was a real fairy princess, delicate, graceful, exquisite,’ he would later write. In 1957, Dior presented the princess with a signed silk scarf in appreciation of her support, while she was a loyal customer for years.Gown almost too daring for Diana It was 1996 and Princess Diana walked into the biggest event on the fashion industry calendar in a dress that was at once ravishing and racy.So racy, in fact, Diana very nearly didn’t wear the dress to New York’s Met Gala for fear Prince William, then 14, wouldn’t like it being so revealing.Brit John Galliano had just been appointed creative director at the fashion house, and designed the dress for Diana before turning his mind to his first collection.A navy silk slip dress, with lace straps and edging, it had more than a hint of the boudoir about it and was a bold choice from Diana, who was then 35.She stopped the fashion crowd dead in their tracks, Liz Tilberis, editor of Harper’s Bazaar, would later write.A statement look for every star  From Margot Fonteyn to Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson, the house of Dior has dressed stars in abundance.At the start they were drawn to the designer’s famed Bar suit — part of his 1947 ‘Corolle’ collection. Crafted from shantung silk, crepe wool and taffeta, it has become one of the brand’s most iconic pieces.  Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year (left) and Nicole Kidman in a beaded gown at Cannes (right)Ballet dancer Dame Margot Fonteyn was one of Christian Dior’s early muses and the exhibition features two dresses she wore, including a 1950 evening gown named ‘Debussy’, made of silk satin with hundreds of dragonfly sequins.Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year.           Naomi Campbell pictured in Dior in 1997There’s also the silk confection Jennifer Lawrence wore to a film premiere in September 2017, a beaded gown worn by Nicole Kidman in Cannes  — and many more.Fashion firebrands who kept his name alive   A string of illustrious names followed in Dior’s footsteps.First came a 21-year-old Yves Saint Laurent, whose early designs were so strikingly similar to his illustrious predecessor that when he sent them to French Elle magazine, the then editor thought it was Dior playing tricks.Next came Marc Bohan — he assumed the helm until 1989.Italian Gianfranco Ferré became the first non-French artistic director, until 1996 when controversial Brit John Galliano took over — supermodel Naomi Campbell is pictured in one of his typically flamboyant designs in 1997.His reign came to a rather ignominious end when he was sacked in 2011, paving the way for Raf Simons and finally Maria Grazia Chiuri, the second Italian and first woman, appointed in July 2016.Anglophile and his blue-blooded fans   Christian Dior first visited the UK in 1926 and was something of an Anglophile. He admired the grandeur of Britain’s great stately homes and gardens, as well as British-designed ocean liners, roast beef and Savile Row suits.Dior’s chic little black suits of the 1940s and 1950s were beloved by the British aristocracy, and muses Nancy Mitford and Margot Fonteyn both ordered his 1947 ‘Daisy’ suit.Mitford wrote to her sister Diana Mosley later that year, of Dior’s second collection: ‘Now I’m nearly 50 I’ve decided to choose a style and stick to it and I choose Dior’s present collection. Simply, to my mind, perfect.’          Christian Dior (left) became an Anglophile after visiting Britain in 1926 and his suits were beloved by the British aristocracy           Charlize Theron has been the face of J\u0027Adore by Dior since 2004‘I adore the English,’ Dior wrote in his memoir.‘I love English traditions, English politeness, English architecture, I even love English cooking!\u0027I dote on Yorkshire pudding, mince pies, stuffed chicken, and above all I worship the English breakfast of tea, porridge, eggs and bacon.’Sweet smell of success    A clever marketer, Christian Dior was a fashion pioneer in more than one respect: he launched a perfume line in 1947, the very same year of his first collection.He very quickly created lipsticks, introduced hats, shoes and even stockings — wanting to provide a ‘one-stop’ service for his well-heeled clients.Latterly, Dior’s perfumes have had a gold theme.In 1999, the fashion house launched J’Adore, a perfume celebrating Christian Dior’s love of glimmering gold.Since 2004, the face of J’Adore has been actress Charlize Theron.The Hollywood beauty has appeared on screen and in print in a series of ever-more dazzling gold gowns, several of which are on display at the V\u0026ampA.They include fashion designer John Galliano’s J’Adore dress from 2008, which was adorned with sequins and Swarovski crystals.Duchess of Sussex waves to fans during visit to City Uni LondonMeghan Markle arrives at The ACU with her hair up in a bunChildren perform for The Duchess of Sussex at the National TheatreJess Phillips: \u0027I thought I\u0027d met posh people before I came here\u0027Camilla Thurlow blows up landmine in gripping new TV showMeghan stuns in an all black outfit as she arrives at City UniversityDuke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive in Dundee to open V\u0026ampA MuseumMeghan Markle arrives at the National Theatre for royal patron debutAlexandra Ocasio-Cortez insists on having lounge uniforms for workDuchess of Cornwall arrives at Royal Academy for life drawing classLittle ladies and gents who attend etiquette lessons graduateMeghan is pretty in peach as she visits the National Theatre"},{"url":null,"title":"How weeks dithering bricks use helped push cost new EastEnders set","story":"    The Carter family outside the Queen Vic pub.

There is no other choice.‘If you want to be a shining star at the BBC, you are going to have to follow this course of action.’Asked whether he accepted this, Lord Hall said: ‘Yes I acknowledge that. People were pushed into these things. We’re saying that we’ve accepted responsibility. That’s full responsibility.’The BBC previously stood by a 2012 report published by Deloitte, which found ‘no evidence of any pressure to move staff to the PSC arrangements’.But yesterday Lord Hall and his deputy director-general, Anne Bulford, accepted that there was pressure regardless.Lord Hall said: ‘Going back and trying to find records of how these PSCs were set up and people’s correspondence with the BBC about them - we can’t find any record which point to one way or the other.‘But the evidence from people I’ve talked to is... that they were asked to take up PSCs’."},{"url":null,"title":"Dirty Duchess Argyll subject TV drama","story":"    Margaret Campbell, the Duchess of Argyll, is pictured outside the law courts in London in 1960 during what became a famous orce caseA British aristocrat known as the \u0027Dirty Duchess\u0027 of Argyll - whose husband accused her of sleeping with up to 88 men including government ministers and royals - will be the subject of a TV drama. The mini-series about Margaret Campbell, whose sex scandal made headlines in 1963, will be a spin-off of the BBC\u0027s award-winning A Very English Scandal. The Duchess\u0027s orce ignited public speculation when a list emerged of more than 80 men she had reportedly slept with, said to include two ministers and three members of the royal family. Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said the scandal made her the first woman to be publicly \u0027slut shamed\u0027.  Granting the orce, presiding judge Lord Wheatley said she \u0027was a completely promiscuous woman whose sexual appetite could only be satisfied with a number of men\u0027.The Duchess was the third wife of Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, whose family owned Inveraray Castle in western Scotland. Born Margaret Whigham, she married wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933, having three children with him. Sorry ladies, the nation has voted for its greatest icons of...Great British Bake Off star Nadiya opens up about her...Share this articleAfter orcing him in 1947 she married the Duke in 1951 but the marriage fell apart after her suspicious husband hired a locksmith to break open a cupboard at her house in Mayfair. The search allegedly uncovered love letters and polaroid photos of her engaging in sexual acts with her various partners.           First marriage: The Duchess of Argyll on her wedding day after marrying wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933           Second marriage: Margaret on the day she became Duchess of Argyll, after marrying Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, at Caxton Hall in London in March 1951  Margaret Campbell is pictured left at Inveraray Castle in Scotland in 1953 and right at a party in 1961.

Seen in an undated photo An Ofsted report in 2016 revealed a series of disturbing practices at the school, including library books that  \u0027included derogatory comments about, and the incitement of violence towards, women\u0027. The school applied for judicial review of the report in the High Court. Mr Justice Jay ruled Ofsted was right to criticise the school over the offensive books, but segregating pupils did not breach the law if both genders were treated identically.However, this decision was overturned in the Court of Appeal in July 2017. According to a report in The Sun, Mr Tryl told the women and equalities select committee this week:  \u0027The Court of Appeal rightly said that schools needed a transition period where they were segregating and yet still we have not just Al-Hijrah but we have countless other schools, mixed schools which are segregating on the basis of sex.School staff member in his 50s is found dead in the grounds...Man in his 60s is arrested over footage posted online of...Head teacher of a state school dubbed the \u0027socialist Eton\u0027...Share this article\u0027Similarly other schools who have refused to teach about sexual orientation issues.

The Daily Mail has worked on behalf of the pupils, the parents and the people of Birmingham, to inform them what is happening.

If they are not, they will be none the wiser and they cannot hold people to account. It is disgraceful that they are trying to hide these issues.\u0027Al-Hijrah was previously investigated over its finances and has a connection with the Trojan Horse schools.The disclosure case centered on an inspection in June last year, in which inspectors accused the school of breaching the Equality Act 2010. The state-funded school, for pupils aged four to 16, separates girls and boys from Year 5 onwards for religious reasons.Ofsted carried out the inspection after receiving an anonymous email claiming to be from a pupil, saying any interaction between genders was forbidden.It said: \u0027I am worried about going to college and not having the social skills to be able to speak normally to the opposite gender.\u0027 During the inspection, a girl told Ofsted that segregation was \u0027dumb\u0027 and she did not know \u0027how to have any relationshipfriendship with boys\u0027.One of the books in the school\u0027s library said a wife was \u0027not allowed to refuse sex to her husband\u0027 and another said \u0027women are commanded to obey their husbands and fulfil their domestic duties\u0027.In addition, two books said a husband could beat his wife as long as it was not done \u0027harshly\u0027.

For years I’ve been searching for the clues that would explain this weird and wonderful genius. I’ve visited the Tuscan hill town Vinci, where an illegitimate boy called Leonardo was born in 1452, and Amboise in the Loire Valley, where he died on 2 May 1519, looking for traces of his secret self. Yet it was on an icy afternoon in the Welsh capital that I finally found the killer clue to a real Leonardo da Vinci mystery: his sex life.Leonardo’s inky fingerprint has been found – it’s just barely visible with the naked eye – on his drawing The Cardiovascular System and Principal Organs of a Woman, done c.1509-10, yet this is not the revelation. This big, bold graphic dissection of a female body is a window on Leonardo’s emotions. He has drawn a female nude then transposed against her rounded breasts a complex machinery of tubes and pumps, bags and balloons. Her uterus looks like an alien creature. As an image of the female form it isn’t exactly intimate, let alone lustful. At the National Museum Wales, you can look straight from this to a far more sensual portrayal of the human body that he drew in about 1504: a scintillating study of a naked man from behind. Leonardo’s muscular model stands at attention, showing us his curly locks and rippling back. His hands seem to visibly shake with contained energy. His stance is potent. Leonardo uses red chalk to give this nude a carnal warmth: its softness lets him delicately model every bulge and recess of taut skin. The man’s buttocks are ripe ovals of perfection.These drawings shown together truly seem to decode something about the Renaissance artist, scientist, engineer and inventor who died 500 years ago this year. To celebrate Leonardo’s half-millennium, the Royal Collection, which owns the world’s most eye-popping hoard of his graphic works, has scattered traces of his true self across the UK: 12 museums in 12 cities have each got a piece of him. Perhaps, if you could somehow see all the shows, you would know everything there is to know about Leonardo. He would come to life and talk.And there is so much to explain. Looking from Leonardo’s loving, lingering male nude to his vision of what is clearly, for him, the alien entity of womanhood, it’s hard not to share Sigmund Freud’s analysis in his book on him that this Renaissance man loved other men. So is that it? Was Leonardo gay – and is that the key to his inner life?And yet, before you can humanise Leonardo you have to acknowledge the superhuman in him. It hits like a thunderbolt in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery’s gorgeous show of drawings sharply lit against dark blue walls. Every drawing in this exhibition is more than five centuries old. And these medieval masterpieces are incredibly well preserved. Each nuance of chalk, ink and colour wash seems to have been frozen forever. This is one reason why, I believe, you can get much closer to Leonardo in his drawings than in his paintings. His paintings have been restored and repainted over the centuries, or fallen to bits, like The Last Supper. But these sketches are pristine. They are not by his assistants. They are pure clear windows on his mind, many with his notes in his reversed handwriting interspersed among the images.In his drawing of A Storm Over a Valley he uses red chalk again, this time to create what feels more like a modelling of the atmosphere than a mere landscape sketch. Rolling banks of cloud billow above a mountain valley, releasing heavy cascades of rain on the settlements below. But what’s spooky is the point of view. Leonardo seems to be looking down on the little human world of churches and farms from far, far above.Perhaps he’s standing on a mountaintop – he did explore the Alps. Yet there are other landscapes by him that also seem to be seen from the sky. Famously, he tried to make a flying machine. This drawing shows flight is central to his way of thinking about the world: he literally wanted to rise above it all.For Leonardo was not at ease in human society. Why would he be? In one drawing in the Cardiff exhibition he portrays a thuggish face, a huge, fleshy head on a thick neck. In another work, in Bristol, he delineates a savage battle. They are both instances of his bleak feelings about the brutality and violence of our species. Other masterpieces show how, near the end of his life, he became obsessed with deluges tearing the world apart, smashing a mountain, destroying an army like ants under the swirling power of the elements.His curiosity is so insistent, like that of a staring child. Or maybe a serial killer, meticulously drawing the bones of the dead. No one had ever before looked at human anatomy as Leonardo does in drawings based on his own dissections. He finds within us a mysterious architecture. The interior of the heart is laced with fan vaulting like a gothic cathedral. Our bodies are labyrinths of tunnels and cavities, spheres and tree branches.That magic weave of fragile organic stuff links all nature. In his portrait of a woman looking downward, a design for his late painting The Virgin and St Anne, she sports a richly textured lacy headdress. The ruffled silk looks like a jellyfish sac he’s seen washed up on shore: the Virgin is wearing a marine organism in her hair. In a map of the river Arno in Tuscany the blue tendrils of the river look like tentacles, roots, or veins in a human body.The more of these drawings you see the more startling and real Leonardo becomes. But so does his jaundiced view of our species. We’re just part of a bigger picture. Human organs and the Earth, microcosm and macrocosm, all mirror each other. Perhaps that’s why the art of Leonardo leaves you so enraptured. I felt as if I could see my own skeleton and those of Cardiff passersby as I popped into Greggs for a vegan sausage roll. Come to think of it, Leonardo would have approved. He was a vegetarian. If everything is one interwoven fabric, he thought, who are we to act like lords of creation?• Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing runs 1 February-6 May in in Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Southampton and Sunderland.

Six years after the death of Hugo Chávez died, when power passed to his protege Nicolás Maduro, the economy has imploded, democratic trappings have been stripped away, millions have fled the country and Donald Trump is threatening to aid in ousting Maduro and establish the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as president.Raul Gallegos’s Crude Nation shows how what was once South America’s most stable, wealthy country swerved towards the abyss. A former economic journalist who lived in Caracas, Gallegos dissects the nationalisations, expropriations, subsidies and controls on prices and currencies that warped the economy during Chávez’s 12-year rule. Petrol became virtually free while milk, sugar, coffee and toilet paper routinely vanished from stores. Gallegos blends analysis with reportage, including a picaresque roadtrip with a Che Guevara lookalike – to show how Maduro inherited a mess and made it worse.Dragon in the Tropics, by the Venezuelan academics Javier Corrales and Michael Penfold, is a scholarly focus on the politics, explaining how Chávez bequeathed a system based on populism, personality cult, electoral success and authoritarianism to a hapless successor. Lacking the comandante’s charisma and his luck with high oil prices, Maduro dialled up the thuggery and militarisation.Fernando Coronil’s The Magical State, published in 1997, is a prophetic, anthropological and at times lyrical meditation on how successive presidents used oil revenues to pose as transcendent figures who could conjure modernity, but in the end delivered dysfunction. “Between the cracks one could fleetingly see that the magic of oil money could no longer sustain the magical state.” After taking power in 1999, Chávez intensified the cycle. He masked the continuity by wearing a red beret and, after surviving a US-backed coup in 2002, raining insults on George Bush, who he said was “more dangerous than a monkey with a razor blade”.Chávez renamed his country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and called his revolution the “Bolivarian process” in honour of Simón Bolívar, the 19th-century liberator who ended Spanish rule. Marie Arana’s Bolívar gallops through an extraordinary life and a complex political legacy, both progressive and authoritarian, which laid the foundations of Venezuela. A bracing antidote to the Bolívar cult. When Chávez dug up his bones he gushed: “This glorious skeleton must be Bolívar because you can feel his ardour.”Few contemporary novels have been translated, alas – Jonathan Jakubowicz’s rollicking skewering of the “boligarchs” in Las Aventuras de Juan Planchard deserves a wider readership. But for a portrait of an earlier elite there is a translation of Iphigenia, Teresa de la Parra’s sexually charged story of a young woman who seeks to escape stifling patriarchal decorum, which caused a sensation when published in 1924.Rómulo Gallegos’s Doña Bárbara (1929) is Venezuela’s classic novel, the one schoolkids have to read. It depicts a battle of wills between the mercurial, eponymous heroine and a rancher, with lush, prolix descriptions of the great plains – the llanos – cowboys and spirits. Gallegos, Venezuela’s first democratically elected president, gives insight into the man who succeeded him decades later. Chávez was a llanero, a boy from the plains steeped in its lore, and in office commandeered the airwaves to regale the nation with its songs and stories and myths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc5116c6c7043a72fb7848d4103e9d8e6a04e1e4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afaf74612dde839a6b8402a1ebfe6ef8","title":"stress interviews olivia bland recruitment","story":"It sounds like the job interview from hell. Olivia Bland ended up crying at the bus stop, after what the 22-year-old describes as being deliberately torn to shreds over everything from her writing skills to her posture (apparently even “my arms were wrong, and the way I sat was wrong”). Tech company boss Craig Dean, the man on the other side of the desk, ended up posting what he called a “sleep-deprived and anxiety-driven” apology on Twitter after her account of it all went viral.Tell me your gender, age and political leanings and I can probably guess with reasonable certainty whether your sympathies lie with her or with him. But if nothing else, the rejection email she sent, explaining where Web Applications UK could stick the job it eventually offered her, certainly demonstrates the “timely, concise and effective” communications skills stipulated in the job description.It should be said that Dean’s board of directors later put out a statement, insisting it was confident that there had been “no bullying or intimidation”, while promising to reflect on what had happened. But whatever went on inside that interview room, it patently hasn’t ended well for anybody. Bland compares the whole thing to a conversation with an abusive ex, picking apart everything that was supposedly wrong with her social media naming and shaming being what it is, Dean must now be experiencing something very similar. Since she must have wanted the job originally, and he evidently wanted her to have it, it should not have been impossible to put two and two together without making something that sounds like a particularly squirm-inducing episode of The Office.

So much for trendy management theories about “testing the resilience” of prospective employees.For Dean presumably didn’t pluck his unorthodox conversational gambits out of thin air. The so-called “stress interview”, designed to provoke, embarrass and intimidate interviewees to see how they cope in a crisis, has evidently come a long way since apocryphal stories of Oxbridge dons greeting nervous sixth-formers by putting their feet up on the desk and ordering them to “impress me”. A quick Google of US recruitment sites uncovers endless suggested comments for the would-be boss from hell, ranging from, “It doesn’t look like you accomplished much in your last position,” to, “If you were really good, you would have been promoted. Why haven’t you been?” Other techniques include asking the interviewee questions that seem inappropriately personal to put them off their stride (bizarrely, Bland says she was asked about her childhood and whether her parents were still together), or simply being deliberately rude. Sighing and rolling your eyes during answers, interrupting to take phone calls in the middle of the conversation, even turning your back on the interviewee, all come recommended.It’s the employment equivalent of “negging”, or attempting to pick up women by insulting and undermining them so that in theory they’ll be even more desperate for your approval which made for some truly grim dates during its briefly fashionable heyday. In stress interview theory, the candidate is supposed to remain emotionless throughout, thereby demonstrating that they won’t lose their cool with a difficult client and can take criticism. It says a great deal about what’s wrong with management in too many British companies that anyone would think this is how you uncover talent.Yet sadly, not many candidates would have the nerve to fight back in the current job market. Bland is trying to enter a competitive industry at a time when a lot of people aren’t hiring, at least until they know what’s happening with Brexit. She’s far from the only English graduate with an apparently glittering CV being made to jump through ridiculous hoops for jobs that almost certainly weren’t what they dreamed of in college. For those further down the pile it is, if anything, worse.A few years ago, Currys had to apologise after a man applying for a job in one of its stores was asked to do a “robot dance” in the interview. In the pub and restaurant trade, it has become all too common to be asked to work an unpaid shift by way of interview, a tactic seemingly used by some more unscrupulous managers to fill awkward gaps in the rota. The tougher the economic climate gets, the stiffer the competition, and the more brutal the efforts made to weed out a desperately overcrowded field.It’s true that some industries aren’t for shrinking violets, my own included. Newsrooms can be brutal, and so can the places in which young reporters may find themselves in pursuit of a story. But good reporters need empathy and sensitivity to deal with the people whose lives they’re invading, as well as grit. An industry staffed with human battering-rams serves nobody.And while plenty of employers doubtless have their own horror stories of snowflake graduates with ridiculously high expectations and badly spelled CVs, all too often they’re forgetting how much they still had to learn in their 20s and, more importantly, how they learned it.Nobody looks back with gratitude and affection on the bosses who had evidently watched way too many series of The Apprentice. It’s the ones with the patience to explain, and the skill to build up other people’s confidence rather than knocking it down, for whom you end up going the extra mile. Ironically, Craig Dean must have been exposed to something of a stress test himself over the past 24 hours, with half the internet now scoffing at his management techniques. Somehow, I doubt he has emerged from it convinced of the usefulness of ritual humiliation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331e79ccca96b8a89c2b444f0d1cfcd6cbd7b085/194_206_3087_1852/master/3087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35628cefbdff04d4eb9e1866e76a1da6","title":"the guardian view on the may corbyn talks make them matter","story":"The first thing to say about this week’s talks between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit is that they are a sign of realism on both sides. The second is that they should have taken place months ago. Both leaders must bear a share of responsibility for the long avoidance of cross-party dialogue about a decision that is so fundamental to the British people’s future. But it is Mrs May, as the head of government and the person in charge of Brexit policy, who must bear the larger share by far.The prime minister has come to these talks at the eleventh hour, whereas she should have begun them before she triggered the article 50 withdrawal process 22 months ago. The danger now is that, although welcome in principle, the talks will have little practical effect. This is in part because there is little established basis for trust between the two sides, in part because time is now so limited before 29 March to achieve anything major, and in part because Mrs May – and perhaps Mr Corbyn too – prefers to see them as a tactical expedient, rather than as a serious national opportunity, even at this late stage.The fact remains that, ever since the 2017 election resulted in a hung parliament, it has always been clear to those who can count that Mrs May would struggle to get a Commons majority for anything approaching a pragmatic Brexit agreement with Conservative and DUP votes alone. Her party contains too many deregulatory and anti-European ideologues for that. She already knew this when she became leader in 2016. Two and a half years on, she still knows it. She is more aware than anyone that the 16-vote majority to reopen talks with the EU on the Northern Ireland backstop may not withstand contact with the real world. If that happens, the pressure for serious dialogue will therefore return with full force.Some people may hope that Mrs May could then pivot decisively towards the kind of soft Brexit that would get Labour backing. This would be a spectacular about-face. It would certainly be less bad than no deal or Mrs May’s November 2018 deal. But all this is the triumph of hope over experience. Mrs May shows no sign of contemplating any such thing. It is not in her character. She has done no groundwork. She seems to be using the talks with Labour for narrow and tactical reasons. In other words she is talking to Mr Corbyn in order to frighten her own party into line behind a reworked version of her existing deal. She is not rolling the pitch for a new and softer Brexit approach that she intends to adopt after her new approach to Brussels goes wrong.Reports on Thursday confirm that there is nothing visionary or heroic about Mrs May’s approach. They suggest she is hoping to pick off inidual Labour MPs with offers of constituency funding and investment rather than look for a larger leader-to-leader agreement on Brexit. There are undoubtedly places in Britain where Labour MPs sit for leave-voting constituencies which are crying out for investment amid industrial and community decline. But the same problems exist in remain-voting constituencies too, and in other places across the UK whose MPs choose, for honourable reasons, not to back Mrs May’s Brexit approach. Politics always has a local dimension and MPs have every reason to press for local investment. But local wounds like hospital or college closures are ultimately national issues. They should be addressed strategically, not through a grubby ide-and-rule auction of the minimum number of votes that Mrs May requires to win a majority for her inadequate and dangerous deal.Yet that does not justify not talking, and Labour should not hide behind it. The task of healing isions and bringing people back together is noble and difficult. Party politics is very imperfectly wired for it. This week has reminded us how politicians tend to put their own tribe above the needs of the nation. But Brexit is too big for this. It cuts across everything. In all the hours of debate very few MPs have risen to the full seriousness of what is at stake economically, socially, politically and constitutionally in the harm this process risks inflicting on our people. Everyone is tired and stressed by Brexit. But if it requires more time and more talking to mitigate that harm in an effective and strategic manner, then so be it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ec0d5521e90a96fa7f261f378dd316592d5fd2e/0_93_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=689ac80f66f13f0fa01a0286718f6e5b","title":"uk not ready brexit no deal tsunami institute government","story":"Shellshocked MPs of the sensible tendency are now seriously alarmed. You find them in a daze around Westminster and its news studio green-rooms stunned by Tuesday night’s failure of the modest Cooper amendment to prevent a no-deal crash-out.The Welsh assembly declared yesterday that if Westminster can’t agree, “the only option which remains is to give the decision back to the people” and “work should begin immediately on preparing for a public vote”. No sign of that sentiment in the Commons – but referendum campaigners always knew it would only be the last option when all else finally fails.Parliament begins to look like it’s on a self-destruct mission which will take the whole country down with it. But outside there are plenty of supporters egging them on waving cheery “No Deal – No Problem” placards. No bad news shifts them or the Brexit fanatics within. Certainly not the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, warning EU leaders yesterday to “prepare for the worst”. Today it looks crystal clear that delaying withdrawal beyond 29 March is utterly unavoidable, as the foreign secretary confirmed on Radio 4’s Today programme.The Institute for Government (IFG) lists six crucial bills that cannot pass in time, let alone more than 500 statutory instruments. Most haven’t begun in the Lords, where the government doesn’t control the timetable and each needs serious scrutiny. Flashing red on the IFG implementation charts is unreadiness at the borders, with 10 out of 12 border computer systems unready. There are red flashes for how farmers and fishers can sell their produce to the EU in eight weeks’ time. Red too for medicines and medical supplies. Red again for security: no swapping fingerprints, data or DNA, so will criminals escape across the channel? A legal vacuum is actual – not metaphorical – anarchy.The housing minister Kit Malthouse brokered talks between Brexiters and former remainers on a possible way out of the Brexit impasse.The resulting \u0027Malthouse compromise\u0027 involves redrafting the backstop arrangement for the Irish border which is so unpopular with Conservative Eurosceptic MPs and the Democratic Unionist party, which props up the government.It would also extend the transition period, set out under the previously negotiated withdrawal agreement, until the end of 2021. The extension is designed to give extra time to agree a new trading relationship.Under the plan, the backstop would be replaced with a free trade agreement with as yet unknown technology to avoid customs checks on the Irish border.If the attempt to renegotiate the backstop fails, the Malthouse compromise proposes what amounts to a managed no deal.The PM would ask the EU to honour the extended transition period, in return for agreeing the £39bn orce bill and its commitments on EU citizens’ rights. This would give both sides time to prepare for departure on WTO terms at the end of 2021 – or to negotiate a different deal.The compromise is backed by the DUP, the European Research Group of hard Brexiters, and former remainers including Nicky Morgan. It is this unlikely coalition that helped secure Commons backing for the Brady amendment, which pledged to replace the backstop with unspecified \u0027alternative arrangements\u0027.Before MPs voted for that amendment and against others, Theresa May praised the Malthouse compromise. She said these were \u0027serious proposals\u0027 and she would engage with them \u0027seriously and positively\u0027.Although Brexit is a Tory’s disease, spread over decades by their newspapers with anti-EU myths, lies and conspiracy nonsense, at this 11th hour Labour MPs have responsibilities too. Tory leaders pandered to Eurosceptic fever – worst of all David Cameron ceding this lethal referendum – and they will be blamed if the sky falls in. They will be blamed for years of continuing Brexit bitterness. Labour need own none of it – it need back no Brexit plan of May’s. But Labour MPs will need clean hands.Some remain-voting MPs in leave-voting seats writhe under their dilemma. Lisa Nandy – who did vote for the Cooper bill – makes a good case for “respecting Brexit” for fear blocking it will lead to democratic disillusion and the rise of the non-democratic far-right. But her case is not good enough. With the country at the crossroads, this is where the mettle of every MP is tested to do what’s right even if unpopular – to lead not follow in rescuing the country from present danger.The likes of Anna Turley in leave-voting Redcar and Bridget Phillipson in Sunderland are among many taking that admirable stand. I hear Labour MPs say that if they lose their seats over this, so be it: they will have done their best to stop a Brexit cataclysm. These are the Edmund Burke-ites – though he was ejected by the voters of Bristol he famously ignored.Those Labour MPs who broke the whip did great damage. Across the floor are unknown numbers of vacillating Tories who voted to let May have one last forlorn chance at renegotiating her plan, but next time might vote to prevent a no-deal result. Richard Harrington, business minister, says he gives her two weeks, but then will vote to stop no deal. Amber Rudd, Greg Clark, Philip Hammond and other ministers might resign to vote against no deal – and others stand on that brink. But they will only break their own whip and take that plunge if they are certain the numbers are there: looking across at those Labour 25 who wrecked the Cooper amendment, they may calculate it’s not worth making a gallant gesture unless certain to succeed. They need another 12 on top of the 16 Tories who rebelled on Tuesday.Despite warnings on all sides that no deal creeps closer, I stay determined to believe it impossible the Commons will let it happen. Enough MPs will summon enough courage. The Dromey-Spelman indicative amendment – though only squeaking in – shows a majority ready to stop the worst. Besides, between gritted teeth, despite May calling Brexit her “sacred duty”, I cannot believe she wants a no-deal disaster. She will return effectively empty-handed from Brussels, needing to tell her party only a softer Norwegian-style deal stands a chance.Delay, rethink, renegotiate – or a final say for the voters – these are all more plausible than the Commons opting for no deal. Though she has badly misjudged every stage of Brexit, even she will surely pull back at the last moment. Why would she want to captain the ship when a no-deal tsunami swamps the decks? Surely not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b34815f2ecf779d28276a26c708772271b6f1af9/0_0_941_577/master/941.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f46ea22975dbf80c0f04380d16c00e8","title":"joel edgerton on boy erased i crave the acceptance of the lgbtq community","story":"The actor-director talks about being under scrutiny as a straight man telling and appearing in a story about gay-conversion therapyAre straight directors qualified to tell gay stories on screen? The Australian actor-director Joel Edgerton didn’t think he was. At least, not when first reading Boy Erased: A Memoir, Garrard Conley’s account of his childhood experiences in gay conversion therapy. He knew it would make a compelling film, but he didn’t believe he was best placed to do it.“I was like: fuck, this would be a great movie and I would love to be the one to do it. But I don’t think I can, simply because I’m not of the LGBTQ community,” he says. “I’d really started to think in the last couple of years a lot about representation – mainly in front of the screen.”He optioned the book anyway, unable to shake it from his mind. He sought out Conley, spoke to survivors of conversion therapy, researched the infrastructure surrounding it, met with Conley’s abuser and then began a screenplay. Directing it became a less distant possibility. “It was like, I feel so passionate about it and I can’t get this out of my head.”The resulting film follows Conley – Jared, played by Lucas Hedges – as he comes out to his mother (Nicole Kidman) and father (Russell Crowe), a Baptist preacher who convinces his son to enroll on a 12-day conversion therapy course. The film is largely set in Memphis at the real-life Love in Action, an “ex-gay” Christian ministry, run on screen by Edgerton as chief therapist Victor Sykes (a portrayal of the ministry’s former director, John Smid).To that end, he showed Conley every draft of the script and cut of the movie, and one of the first versions was sent to Glaad, the US organisation that monitors media coverage of LGBTQ issues. According to Edgerton, the organisation had only “one or two” concerns. One character removed from an early draft was a girl enrolled in the Love in Action programme after her parents caught her having an “indiscretion” with the family pet. “Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction,” says Edgerton. “I don’t want any chance for people to watch this movie and think we’re painting anyone of the LGBTQ community as deviant.”Instead, he swung the other way, writing in Troye Sivan’s character, Gary: a composed, seemingly well-adjusted young gay man, savvy enough to tell the conversion therapists what they want to hear. “Love in Action was trying to make people into deviants,” adds Edgerton, “it was not our job as film-makers to do that.”Another omission was that of a teacher who had assaulted his students. The character was originally included to highlight the institution’s practice of putting sexual abusers in the same group as young people (“I found that a fascinating indictment of the lack of care in the place”), but, on reflection, Edgerton felt time constraints inhibited an adequate exploration of the character.Although you wonder how a gay director would have tackled the same issues, the fact that Edgerton is in some ways sanitising Conley’s memoir – rather than sensationalising it – perhaps demonstrates the increasing sensitivities straight directors have about how they tell queer stories. But by Edgerton’s own admission, his eagerness to avoid feeding into gay tropes or causing offence limited his writing.“I also wish I could have been a smart enough writer to amplify a quality in Garrard that he described in the book: that, even at Love in Action, his way of coping, like many of us, was through humour, and he was a bit of a class clown,” he says. “My fear was that if I had Lucas cracking jokes and doing other stuff, it would give the wrong steer and diminish the tension. But I wonder if a better writer than me would have been able to include that as a builder of tension, rather than a diminisher.”Edgerton’s preparation for the film took him to Texas, where he met Smid, the man he would be portraying. Smid joined the Love in Action leadership in 1986 and eventually became its director. He left in 2008 and publicly apologised three years later for the wounds the programme inflicted on vulnerable young people. At the end of the film – spoiler alert – it is revealed that Smid married another man in 2014.Edgerton says Smid was “brave enough” to come to the film’s premiere in New York, and had originally offered himself up as a consultant during its production. Smid is not entirely sold on the telling of events according to Edgerton (although he has written in the Advocate that the film was “largely an accurate depiction of such programmes”).“Looking back, Smid thinks things weren’t as bad and there wasn’t any shouting and all that,” says Edgerton. “But then it’s a case of ‘he said, she said’, I think. Garrard will tell you one thing. John might tell you another. My point of access is Garrard: he’s the guy I side with. But I appreciate John’s open-heartedness to reflect on something and to put his hand up and acknowledge that he made big mistakes.“It was important from me to hear everybody’s point of view,” he continues, “because we were setting out to have an empathetic approach to everybody.”Born in New South Wales, Edgerton was raised a devout Catholic – a “Ned Flanders kid” – in a town he describes as homophobic. Now agnostic (aside, he says, from some Catholic guilt), he internalised the town’s attitudes and had to learn to accept homosexuality later in life.“I experienced bullying, but I also remember being in a group chastising somebody else and being a bully,” he says. “I’ve played both sides of that coin. And I don’t think anybody, or certainly I, never really knew what homosexuality was and yet we would all use these words, these slurs and these derogatory ways of teasing people. And so I’ve definitely been a part of that. Almost like that culture of behaviour that’s learned.“You just treat anybody who’s different in a way that you single them out,” he continues. “You push them around. You do all that stuff. I was never aware of what any of that meant until I met my first gay man when I was 16.”It wasn’t until he began drama school in Sydney that he developed meaningful relationships with gay men and acquired a “real deeper understanding of seuxality and its spectrum.“I had been living in such a cloistered environment where everything is same-same and everybody’s pretending and nobody is doing anything out of the ordinary because it’s all about safety and not being singled out,” he says. “And I was like, OK, there’s a whole other world out here that I’ve never experienced and I’m getting my crash course in right now.”One sequence in the film has met with disapproval: a graphic depiction of a sexual assault on Garrard by another student at his college. Some were frustrated that the only sexual act between two men in the film involved violence others felt that the trauma of sexual abuse was ignored and the film lacked an adequate trigger warning (Edgerton says there is one in Australia).“Most criticism of the film, I find fair,” he says. “I can appreciate that some people are like, ‘Well, where’s the love and tenderness?’ … but the first sexual experience you see in the film is one of violence. It happened to Garrard, it’s very much part of his story. It was a catalyst for him coming out. I wanted to be unflinching about it.“It sounds trite, but it’s tough to please all of the people all of the time, especially when you’re going out on a limb on something that is extreme, like assault,” he adds.Boy Erased scores points among many, however, for casting in its lead role an actor open about his own sexual fluidity. This at a time when the debate over whether straight actors should portray gay characters rages anew, following Darren Criss’s announcement that he would no longer take on gay roles, and awards acclaim for Rami Malek and Olivia Colman playing LGBTQ characters.Edgerton is clearly aware of the sensitivities around the debate. And he recognises that, as a straight man, he will be under particular scrutiny. But he dances around the topic, referencing the backlash against Scarlett Johansson after it was announced she’d been cast as Dante “Tex” Gill, a trans man, and he refuses to commit to either side of the debate. “Maybe that movie will never get that made,” he says. “Is it better that the movie is made? And I’m not putting my opinion into this.”Regardless, he’s happy with the Boy Erased casting in this regard, and fairly so: Hedges (who has previously stated he’s “not totally straight”) in the main role, while Xavier Dolan and Sivan (both out gay men) are cast in secondary roles as gay men. But does he think there is a still a broader issue with hiring LGBTQ people in Hollywood?“Definitely not behind the scenes,,” says Edgerton. “A massive percentage of my behind-the-camera crew, heads of department, are from the LGBTQ community. And they don’t have any trouble getting employment, as far as I can tell.”He hopes that Sivan’s performance in Boy Erased, as well as his various successes elsewhere, could help to inspire other actors to come out. “Troye has shown by example that, by being out and proud, there’s actually maybe an even bigger audience for you than the assumption that you would diminish your audience,” says Edgerton, who claims to “absolutely” know actors who aren’t out. “Clearly, I wouldn’t out anybody. But just the idea that that is your world – it’s almost like you’d rather take away your fame and just lead a normal life. I just can’t imagine what that would feel like. It shouldn’t exist in the acting community.”Edgerton’s hopes for his own finished film are similarly virtuous: being used as an “icebreaker” between young LGBTQ people and their parents, or as a guide for those considering enrolling their children in conversion therapy. He is certainly keen for it to be wider educational piece: before the end credits, viewers are told that 700,000 LGBTQ Americans have undergone conversion therapy programmes, while only 14 US states have deemed it illegal. Ultimately, his ambition seems to be for the film’s cultural relevance to diminish.“It would be nice if, as soon as possible, the film was really a museum piece so that people can watch it and go: ‘Oh shit, they used to do that kind of thing.’ Of course, it’s very naive to say that the persecution of LGBTQ people could ever just go away because conversion therapy is one thing,” he says, before invoking – ambitiously, but perhaps not unfairly – One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest. “The hope is that there was no point even making the film.”• Boy Erased is released on 8 February in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d227ad6319e5d898469c45c8a0dbb8f68e37b9/0_128_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=457bdc5a15672502ad505ba0593a3eaa","title":"the lowdown on british columbia this canadian province is not to be missed","story":"With cosmopolitan cities nudging wide-open wilderness, spectacular wildlife and a superb culinary scene, British Columbia offers a host of amazing adventuresChefs around the world adore BC for its incredible produce, from sweet spot prawns, celebrated in a festival each year at Vancouver’s Fisherman’s Wharf, to the juicy Okanagan cherries and peaches, which locals devour by the crate.Start planning your trip by poring over online menus at stellar Vancouver restaurants such as chef Andrea Carlson’s Burdock \u0026amp Co Gastown go-to, French-influenced L’Abattoir or the upmarket west coast take at Botanist.

But it has emerged that, after an appeal, the two will be able to return to the campus from September.Two of the other men were suspended for just one year, meaning that four of the five who were disciplined could return as students at the start of the next academic year. The fifth student was banned from the campus for life.In an open letter to Warwick, one of the women involved said: “I feel terrified at the prospect of having these boys in my seminars and lectures, as they sit there feeling guilt-free. Knowing that I may have to come face to face with them again just to continue my education is unacceptable.”Saying that she had suffered from depression, anxiety and eating disorders since the group chats were published, the woman said she felt humiliated. “You have failed to protect countless students like myself, and don’t even have an adequate system in place to look after students who are suffering and hurting,” she told the university.The news of the return of the men also provoked a strong reaction among the university’s staff.“Staff and students in my department are united in our shock and disgust at this decision,” Prof Emma Mason, head of Warwick’s English department, said in a letter to the vice-chancellor, Stuart Croft.“We wish to express strong and renewed support for those students harmed by these posts, abhorrence at the contents of the posts, and a deep concern about the decision to reduce the terms of suspension.”The university said in a statement that the behaviour of the men involved in the group chat was “abhorrent and unacceptable”.Prof Christine Ennew, provost of the University of Warwick, said that the appeals panel focussed on the scale of the penalties, with the students accepting culpability.“Privacy considerations mean that we are not able to disclose the specific details on which the decisions were made. However, the panel reached the view that there were clear reasons to require that the punishments imposed should be comparable across all of those iniduals sanctioned,” Ennew said.“The penalties imposed combine direct punishment for the deeply offensive and threatening comments made during the chats, future behavioural restrictions and a requirement to engage in processes to enable them to learn from their past unacceptable behaviour.”The penalties were intended to allow the women affected to complete their studies before the men returned but one woman told The Boar, the Warwick student newspaper: “I wanted to do a master’s here but that’s not an option any more. Other girls who were named and talked about in the chat are still going to be here next year in the same department.”The returning students will have further conditions imposed on them, the university said.Liam Jackson, the president of Warwick students’ union, said there was “considerable unease” around the outcome of the appeals process and he said he wanted to see the university’s disciplinary procedures changed.“We remain shocked by the content of the group chat, and our stance continues to be that sexism, racism and oppression of any kind have no place within our community,” Jackson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af30f2749cb71e0379e64c8cf401eef2b81234d0/0_264_3682_2209/master/3682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f73a6196d9aa6099391b322d8c2bd3d","title":"european colonization of americas helped cause climate change","story":"Research finds killing of native people indirectly contributed to a colder period by causing deaths of around 56 million by 1600European colonization of the Americas resulted in the killing of so many native people that it transformed the environment and caused the Earth’s climate to cool down, new research has found.This “large-scale depopulation” resulted in vast tracts of agricultural land being left untended, researchers say, allowing the land to become overgrown with trees and other new vegetation.The regrowth soaked up enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to actually cool the planet, with the average temperature dropping by 0.15C in the late 1500s and early 1600s, the study by scientists at University College London found.“The great dying of the indigenous peoples of the Americas resulted in a human-driven global impact on the Earth system in the two centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution,” wrote the UCL team of Alexander Koch, Chris Brierley, Mark Maslin and Simon Lewis.The drop in temperature during this period is known as the “Little Ice Age”, a time when the River Thames in London would regularly freeze over, snowstorms were common in Portugal and disrupted agriculture caused famines in several European countries.The UCL researchers found that the European colonization of the Americas indirectly contributed to this colder period by causing the deaths of about 56 million people by 1600. The study attributes the deaths to factors including introduced disease, such as smallpox and measles, as well as warfare and societal collapse.Researchers then calculated how much land indigenous people required and then subsequently fell into disuse, finding that around 55m hectares, an area roughly equivalent to France, became vacant and was reclaimed by carbon dioxide-absorbing vegetation.The study sketches out a past where humans were influencing the climate long before the industrial revolution, where the use of fossil fuels for the manufacturing of goods, generation of electricity and transportation has allowed tens of billions of tons of carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere.Widespread deforestation for agriculture and urban development has also spurred the release of greenhouse gases, causing the planet to warm by around 1C over the past century. Scientists have warned that the world has little over a decade to drastically reduce emissions or face increasingly severe storms, drought, heatwaves, coastal flooding and food insecurity.The revegetation of the Americas after European arrival aided declines of global carbon content in the air, dropping by around seven to 10 parts of carbon dioxide for every million molecules of air in the atmosphere. This compares to the 3ppm of carbon dioxide that humanity is currently adding to the atmosphere every year through the burning of fossil fuels.“There is a lot of talk around ‘negative emissions’ approaching and using tree-planting to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change,” study co-author Chris Brierley told the BBC.“And what we see from this study is the scale of what’s required, because the great dying resulted in an area the size of France being reforested and that gave us only a few parts per million.“This is useful it shows us what reforestation can do. But at the same, that kind of reduction is worth perhaps just two years of fossil fuel emissions at the present rate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d80f54de1e2859b8b1f86597a44dfe0c39b4bf1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdb67273f149cabf55a541c0a901a57c","title":"us academics feel the invisible hand of politicians and big agriculture","story":"As universities rely more on industry for funds, researchers taking a stand on health or environment say they’re sidelinedby Kate Cox and Claire BrownIn a windowless conference room epidemiologist Steve Wing was frantically blacking out chunks of his own research.Wing had been working on a study looking into the impacts of industrial-scale hog operations on health for the University of North Carolina. But the state’s Pork Council had caught wind of the research, and filed a Freedom of Information Act Request (FOIA) to gain access to his findings. “They went after Steve, asking him to turn over any documentation. They went directly to the university and got the lawyers to try and make him hand it over,” says Naeema Muhammad, one of Wing’s community partners.Wing had promised the community members who had spoken to him that he’d protect their privacy. Revealing even a few basic details could have compromised their identities. “Because … if their occupation was a nurse, they lived in a household with three other people, they were aged 35-39 … there’s only one person like that in a rural area,” Wing said in a 2015 interview.The university warned Wing that if he failed to hand over the documents, he could be arrested for theft of state property and even sent to jail. The data didn’t belong to him, it belonged to the state. But handing over the identities put his subjects in jeopardy. It wasn’t unheard of for people to lose their jobs for taking a public stand against the politically powerful pork industry.Wing’s lawyer negotiated heavy redactions in response to the FOIA request. “We did give over the records, and I actually to this day remain regretful that I didn’t resist more,” Wing said in the 2015 interview. In November 2016 Wing died. “He went to his deathbed with them still harassing him to turn over his information,” says Muhammad.Work like Wing’s is exactly the kind research institutions are meant to carry out. And academia writ large is supposed to be independent. Scientists at public universities work for the taxpayers. Their research is supposed to advance the public interest.But over the past 30 years, as public funding for university research has dried up, private industry money has poured in. And with industry money comes industry priorities. Agribusiness has funded research that has advanced its interests and suppressed research that undermines its ability to chase unfettered growth. The levers of power at play can seem anecdotal – a late-night phone call here, a missed professional opportunity there. But interviews with researchers across the US revealed stories of industry pressure on iniduals, university deans and state legislatures to follow an agenda that prioritises business over human health and the environment.Take Iowa, a state that is, in both identity and capacity, American farm country. According to data released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in October 2018, the state produces more commodity corn and hogs – and in many years, soybeans – than any other US state. In Iowa, pigs outnumber people by nearly eight to one.For decades, deep relationships have existed between the agriculture industry and the state’s politicians – and increasingly those alliances are catching the state’s universities in their crosshairs. In 1980, when the federal government passed the Bayh-Dole Act, encouraging universities to partner with the private sector on agricultural research, leaders at academic institutions were incentivised to seek money from agribusiness. Two of the state’s universities in particular seem to have felt the reach of this policy: Iowa State, which is a land-grant institution, and the University of Iowa, which doesn’t have an agriculture school but feels the pressure of agribusiness influence. Researchers at both institutions told us they had felt the direct impact of agribusiness dollars on their work. So who’s pulling the strings? Take, for example, the looming presence of the Iowa Farm Bureau – 100 years old, with more than 150,000 members, and sitting on $1.4bn (£1bn) in total assets, having taken in nearly $88 million in revenue in 2015 alone. While the public can’t see the specifics of private-sector funding for universities, we do know that the Iowa Farm Bureau has contributed more than $3m to Iowa State University over the past 30 years.Other industry-specific lobbies – the Iowa Pork Council and other commodity groups – also contribute directly to universities. The Pork Council, for instance, provides scholarship opportunities to Iowa State University students majoring in agriculture-related fields. Additionally, it contributed $200,000 directly to the university, according to tax filings from 2016.And then there are the politically influential businessmen Charles and David Koch, intensely pro-free market billionaires who line the coffers of far-right politicians, and who owe their immense fortunes in part to manufacturing fertiliser. In 2017, the Koch Foundation announced a donation of nearly $1.7m to Iowa State University for an economics programme.That makes the agribusiness industry a powerful special interest in Iowa’s universities.Of course, this money has helped to create world-class courses and opportunities for many students and academics. Nevertheless, some would argue that it has also created an atmosphere in which research that is not directly helpful to the industry can appear to bite the hand that fed it.In 2017, for example, after 30 years of research into alternative methods of agriculture, the Aldo Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State was deprived of funds in the state budget in a bill signed off by former governor Terry Branstad (whose own campaign received $88,000 from the Iowa Farm Bureau, coincidentally). It left the institution alive in name only.Or back a little further, when Jim Merchant, the founding dean of the University of Iowa College of Public Health, retired, he planned to continue analysing an existing data set, the Keokuk County Rural Health Study. (Professors are often allowed to conduct research after they retire.) He’d already published work using the same data set to link industrial-scale hog farms with asthma rates in local children. Still, he thought there were more insights to be gleaned from the information that had been collected.Money wasn’t a problem. Merchant had secured funding to carry out his work. Yet, he says, the administration of the School of Public Health stalled the project in 2014. He was told he couldn’t do research as an emeritus professor, even though it had been permitted in the past.He suspected that the school’s concerns about potential blowback from Iowa’s $7bn livestock agriculture industry had something to do with it. His work was a threat: establishing a link between hog farming and childhood asthma rates could prompt the state legislature to regulate emissions – an expensive proposition for the industry. If Merchant was right, it wouldn’t have been his first encounter with the industry’s invisible reach. In 2002, an entire school of agriculture distanced itself from a seemingly rock-solid, collaborative study – of which he was a part – on air emissions from animal operations. Some two dozen scientists and researchers from the state’s two major universities were involved.Then-governor of Iowa Tom Vilsack had asked them to collaborate on a study of CAFO (concentrated animal feeding operations) impact on air quality. The researchers submitted a 221-page response. At the time, Merchant says the collaborators had reached a consensus on the executive summary. “We agreed on every word,” he says.David Osterberg, professor emeritus in the Department of Occupational and Environmental Health at the University of Iowa, and a fellow member of the study group, remembers it the same way. “After the report came out – immediately afterwards – the Farm Bureau demanded that Iowa State professors come to their headquarters to get beat up,” he says. “It was like, the next morning: ‘You be here tomorrow.’ They were livid.”Shortly after, the public distancing started. A story in National Hog Farmer, an industry-backed publication, quoted several anonymous sources who undermined Merchant’s claim of academic consensus. Then, at a meeting with state legislators, Wendy Wintersteen, the current university president who was then associate dean of the College of Agriculture at Iowa State, said her university was backing away from the report. She declined to comment for this story. “This is inidual work of 12 Iowa State faculty members – not a report of Iowa State University – the work of 12 faculty members, of their inidual research,” Merchant says, still indignant years later.The danger that Merchant was highlighting – compromised academic integrity by way of industry-related golden handcuffs – isn’t limited to Iowa. In the mid-2000s, the Pew Charitable Trusts commissioned a large study on animal agriculture and antibiotics. Bob Martin, director of food system policy at the Johns Hopkins University’s Center for a Livable Future in Baltimore, Maryland, led the project. By most measures, it was unique in its scope and scale. It was one of the first to critically examine the role of antibiotics in meat production, and friends told Martin the findings had a major impact on the Obama administration’s agricultural agenda.But as he got deeper into the work, Martin says he noticed that researchers were afraid to be associated with it. “We were approached every time we went near a land-grant school – Iowa State, NC State, University of Arkansas. Professors would pull us aside and say they’re under enormous pressure when they get industry funding to kind of cater their research to that.”Martin estimates that about half a dozen contributing researchers asked for their names to be withheld from the list of authors in the final draft for fear of retribution.A number of researchers we spoke to across the country echoed similar concerns. Their experiences range from seeing their published work undermined in industry magazines to being discouraged from conducting certain research or feeling undermined by their own deans, and one person was even driven out of the field entirely. Another researcher, who agreed to testify in a lawsuit that threatened to hold industry accountable for pollution, saw his position eliminated just before the court battle began. As soon as the plaintiffs lost, he was re-hired.Of course, it’s not all fear and loathing in academia. Marty Strange, who teaches agriculture history and policy at Green Mountain College in Vermont, says the private sector offers tantalising incentives, too. Industry-backed groups host conferences, pay high speaker fees, and hire academics for lucrative consulting jobs. “Any time you have people who work in the public trust who can freelance and get private-sector money for doing private-sector things, you’re going to get intellectual corruption,” says Strange.And for a university administrator, balancing industry priorities and academic freedom may be more complex than it appears. Incentive structures for school leaders in agriculture states are entirely different from those for independent researchers. Administrators’ success is measured in part by the money they bring in, and the Pew Commission found that they’ve been forced to rely more on industry money to keep their institutions afloat.But the change has not gone unnoticed. In 2013, former Iowa senator Tom Harkin revoked plans to donate his papers from 40 years in the House and Senate to a namesake public policy institute at Iowa State, his alma mater. As Politico reported at the time, Harkin’s reason was startling: “He said he was backing out after it became clear he could not trust university leaders to allow unrestricted academic freedom at the institute.”Academic freedom appears increasingly conditional. But that’s not the premise on which public research universities were founded. They are supposed to prioritise the public interest. Arguably, ag-friendly universities have left that behind in favour of research that benefits their agribusiness benefactors. And for researchers in certain fields, life can be made easier by just sticking to the script.“If you wish to get ahead in academia – particularly in a land-grant university, and we saw this again and again through our Pew Report – Big Ag has a stranglehold over land grant universities,” says Jim Merchant, the former dean of Iowa University’s School of Public Health, who was barred from completing his funded research as an emeritus professor.Ultimately, he says, “agribusiness has tremendous influence on their research … as a result of that, the administrators and the faculty at these land-grant universities are heavily influenced, if not beholden, to agricultural interests.”This article was published with The New Food Economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c1bcb522e06b12dbf3032d5aaecea972b80fda/317_806_6124_3674/master/6124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52e5b17123d76d58d383ecd14f744124","title":"whistleblower christopher wylie joins fashion retailer h m","story":"Canadian who exposed data misuse at Cambridge Analytica hired as research directorChristopher Wylie, the Canadian whistleblower who last year exposed the misuse of data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, has been hired by the Swedish fashion retailer H\u0026ampM.The business confirmed that it had signed a consultancy contract with Wylie, who will take the role of research director.

Besides that, he also supports our work on sustainable and ethical AI,” said a spokesperson for the retailer.It comes after H\u0026ampM reported its sixth consecutive quarter of falling profits, as well as an announcement in March that it had an increased level of unsold garments, worth more than $4bn (£3.05bn) in total. As a result, the company is stepping up its use of data and artificial intelligence to predict future sales and minimise such costs.Wylie was working towards a PhD in fashion trend forecasting when he joined SCL Elections, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. He devised a method that used personal information harvested from Facebook accounts to create political and psychological profiles of users. Targeted advertisements could then be used to influence the political opinions and voting habits of those signed up to the social network. The method was found to have been used during the 2016 US presidential election.Wylie also revealed how his research had found that fans of American denim brands such as Wrangler, Hollister and Lee Jeans were found to be more likely to engage with pro-Trump messaging.

In this sense, chayote is a typical gourd, uncertainly positioned between fruit and vegetable, and confusingly sweet for something most often used in a savoury context. To look at, it’s a fruit if a granny smith and a quince went on a naughty weekend, the chayote might plausibly be the upshot. It has the apple’s lurid green skin, which, unless grated or chopped very finely, is best peeled off its quince-like, quite dry flesh before being added to all manner of dishes.Having peeled, cored and sliced one into large dice, I try some raw, and am reminded of an under-ripe green melon or a flavoursome cucumber – it is crunchy and sweet, but not cloyingly so. I like it … but then I’m about to sauté it with butter, garlic, spring onions and parsley, which seems a bit wrong. But it turns out I am the one that’s wrong, because it works well with our meal of chicken, rice and roasted cauliflower, the garlic offsetting the sweetness and the butter bringing richness.Like the bitter gourd used in Sri Lankan curries, chayote loses its hard edges when cooked, softening and melting into the other ingredients without losing its crispiness. As Miss Fay, from the YouTube channel Cook Like a Jamaican, says: “It’s very bland in itself, but whatever you add it to, it absorbs the flavour.” For this reason, chayote often isn’t the star of the show, instead fleshing out soups, stews and curries. It’s robust enough to be baked with cheese or stuffed with meat, and absorbs pickle liquor or salad dressing like a pro.Chayote won’t be replacing courgette – or other summer squashes, to which it is often compared – in my kitchen any time soon. Although it is clearly versatile, I don’t think it slots into my repertoire seamlessly enough to be worth a special trip to Asda. But I do think that if I were fed (and fell in love with) a dish in which it featured prominently, I would make a point of buying it for that purpose, weaving it into my culinary inventory more as an ingredient for a specific recipe than as a veg drawer novelty.

While it is never wise to pre-suppose Roman Abramovich’s mood, the hierarchy are less inclined these days to fire a manager who has barely had time to reinstate ketchup on the menu at the training ground canteen.Yet the sense is inescapable that Maurizio Sarri cannot simply plough on like this. There has to be an acknowledgment that something has to be done differently, primarily in terms of the side’s tactical approach. Chelsea and Abramovich knew they were hiring a manager whose faith in his philosophy was unswerving, born of a rise through Italian amateur football into Serie A with Empoli and Napoli, but a manager of any clout has to be able to adapt to a certain extent.There is an art to improvisation. It cannot simply be a case of blindly repeating the same approach, and then, when the same problems duly flare up, issuing the same exclamations of astonishment in public.The 4-0 thrashing at Bournemouth on Wednesday was, on the one hand, a shock to the system given Chelsea have not endured a dismissal so emphatic in the top flight since 1996. But, on the other hand, it was all so eminently predictable. Eddie Howe heaped praise post‑match on the efforts of David Brooks and Josh King in shutting down Jorginho, through whom Sarri’s team set their rhythm, but any opponents worth their salt have been doing that against Chelsea since Tottenham stifled the Italy midfielder at source in late autumn. Perceived lesser sides, those on whom the onus is not to pass their elite opponents off the pitch, have settled better into implementing the feverish industry which tends to close Chelsea down. They can be opened up too, at pace.“We haven’t even learned the most basic moves yet,” he offered to an Italian broadcaster on Wednesday when the question of Sarri‑ball cropped up. “We need to work on the basics, the primary foundations of my football. Only then will we try to change a few things. We had assumed we had learned a certain style of football but the truth is we never did learn it and are paying the consequences.”Sarri is desperate to have time on the training pitches, where he can monotonously drum home his principles in the hope they become second nature. He had endured relatively slow starts with Empoli and Napoli but the players eventually cottoned on. Yet the relentless nature of the schedule in the Premier League is denying him that same opportunity now. He must already be pining for a proper pre-season though, first, he has to reach the summer with his position intact.The board knew what they were appointing and it is not in the regime’s nature to seek to force the manager to play a different way. But they will surely expect to see signs of an ability to adapt from the stubborn outlook, even if that threatens to push Sarri away from his underlying principles en route. They will seek evidence that the team’s approach does not always have to revolve entirely around Jorginho, Sarri’s crutch but a player who was always likely to need time to adapt to life in a far more frenetic ision.Chelsea need to inject pace, or natural width, or even raw aggression (Diego Costa’s snarl has never been more missed). Something, anything, to give opponents an unanticipated problem because, at present, everyone knows what they are going to confront when they play Chelsea. It is all too predictable. How Sarri must wish Gonzalo Higuaín was fully fit and firing. “But, at this moment, he is not in good shape, probably because he has played very little recently between transfer market distractions and back pain,” said Sarri of the striker. In truth, pinning hopes on a 31-year-old loanee enduring the toughest season of his career feels risky.Even the reaction to failure is starting to feel tired. Sarri has questioned his players’ motivation and even reverted to Italian to add more punch to his message after the defeat at the Emirates Stadium. At Bournemouth he cast his coaching staff from the dressing room post‑match and spent an hour with his players attempting to pinpoint why this team’s performance can unravel so rapidly from a position of relative comfort.César Azpilicueta claimed they had “spoken as men” through an honest post-mortem, though the suggestion is most of the talking came from Sarri with the squad in hushed silence for long periods. There were further talks as a group before practice back at the training ground on Thursday.Sarri had travelled home from Bournemouth in a car driven by a member of his coaching staff so he could prepare the squad’s first session before the meeting with Huddersfield on Saturday.Defeat is inconceivable, while victory against the ision’s whipping boys will hardly prove Chelsea have turned a corner. But this boom and bust, from week to week, cannot continue. Something has to change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6a966c75e8939750fb3fd41334168874006ca14/0_83_5297_3179/master/5297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b82cea61ed80370684b29386e3aa0efc","title":"damning report calls on uk to come clean over arms exports yemen","story":"Study questions lack of detail surrounding scale and quantity of weapons salesA highly critical report has found extensive flaws in the British government’s arms sales strategy.Based on analysis of the Yemen conflict, the study urges a reduction in weapons exports to conflict zones and states involved in human rights abuses.“Our conclusion is based on copious, authoritative information, and is compelling,” said Roy Isbister of Saferworld, joint authors of the report. “All of the warring parties in Yemen are repeatedly in breach of international law.

The report reinforces concerns raised by CAEC last year following a review of UK arms sales in 2016, when the body called for greater regulation, transparency and compliance in the government’s decision-making process. The government response then acknowledged improvements were needed but failed to agree that the system fell short.Taking Yemen as a case study, the report uses statistical analysis to support the case for a suspension of arms to the Saudi coalition, as well as other warzones and countries on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) watchlist for human rights breaches. The authors advocate a joined-up approach to conflict resolution, with improvements to development and peace-building initiatives currently supported by the Department for International Development (DfID).Quoting statistics on arms supplies to Saudi Arabia for use in the Yemen conflict, the report shows that the British government authorised 18,107 open license deliveries of arms and dual-purpose equipment between 2015 and 2017, with no disclosure required of the quantities or value involved. A delivery could range from a single part for an aircraft valued at £1 to 20 Eurofighter Typhoon jets valued at £2.5bn. The figures exclude authorisations under single inidual export and broker licenses.“The reporting on the use of open licences is wholly inadequate, as the type and quantities of equipment are a mystery,” said Isbister. “Are we talking a few nuts and bolts, or containers full of critical fighter aircraft components? We don’t know, and the government won’t tell. It’s not good enough, not by a long shot.”Official UN statistics suggest the death toll in Yemen as of March 2018 was in the region of 6,592, with a further 10,470 people injured. Control Arms said the figures failed to take into account deaths from malnutrition and disease, which would bring the number of people killed to somewhere between 56,000 and 80,000, according to analysis by the Armed Conflict Location \u0026amp Event Data Project (Acled).Detailing the devastating impact of conflict on Yemen’s infrastructure, Acled statistics revealed that of the 3,362 air strikes carried out in 2018, 420 hit residential areas, 231 struck farms, 95 hit civilian buses or vehicles, and 57 hit educational facilities or marketplaces. Ten attacks took place on medical facilities and two on NGO camps.Noting that only 75 of 1,015 incidents affecting infrastructure were analysed by the joint incident investigation team, the report called for more comprehensive investigation of such attacks.More than 24 million people in Yemen are in need of humanitarian assistance, almost half of them children, and food shortages continue to affect up to 16 million people, the report’s authors noted.The report’s authors also recommended that the government should comply with its own FCO annual human rights report by ending arms supplies to countries guilty of human rights abuses. According to statistics supplied by NGO Action on Armed Violence, between 2008 and 2017, the UK government authorised arms export licenses worth £12bn to such countries, with a further £10bn in dual-use (military and non-military uses) licenses to countries on the FCO watchlist.The report’s authors challenged the government on its claim that the UK’s export controls system is “among the best and most robust in the world, with each application assessed on a case-by-case basis”, a stock response to criticism of existing measures. The report called for comparison with states such as Germany, where there is a “more restrictive and accountable approach” to weapon supplies in Yemen, and questioned why CAEC have consistently failed to hold the government to account.“The largest failing of the UK export control system in the last decade or more, by a mile, is the government’s willingness to supply the Saudi- and UAE-led war effort in Yemen,” said Isbister. “CAEC had almost nothing to say on the matter in last year’s report Yemen is completely absent from the terms of reference for the current enquiry, and we are at a loss to understand why.”Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said: “I share the concern of NGOs that CAEC is ineffective at holding the government to account over its routine contravention of its own arms export controls. It is extremely deferential to the government, which rejects even the most piecemeal of its recommendations. I hope that this year members will work together to push the government for a radical overhaul of licensing, enforcement and auditing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca226f08a38a985a2a688787faa33bb520c14101/97_147_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3420bf7f731e217f11bf85db674d37e","title":"judge to review fiona onasanya ruling after leniency objection","story":"Former Labour MP’s three-month jail term to be re-examined after complaintFiona Onasanya, the MP jailed for repeatedly lying about a speeding ticket, is to have her three-month prison sentence reviewed after a complaint that it is unduly lenient.

There cannot be one law for those in positions of power, privilege and responsibility and another for those who are not,” he said.If the attorney general’s office finds the sentence to be unduly lenient, the case will be referred to the court of appeal which will decide whether or not to increase it.Onasanya, 35, who now sits as an independent, is appealing against her conviction.

Laverne still has an outstanding £40,000 loan to the company which could now be at risk, while other investors also face losing out.Staff at the website, which raised at least £4m from shareholders, were not paid January’s wages and will now have to see what can be recovered by administrators to pay their salaries.Many freelance journalists are owed thousands by the site, which lost £1.8m in the last financial year and was known for its relatively generous freelance rates in a struggling industry.Dominic Hill, the company’s only remaining director, told staff that he had no choice but to put The Pool into administration: “As a director and shareholder, I have a duty to do this as the business is now insolvent and we have exhausted all rescue ideasplans.”He told staff that the administrator would “explain the process which will include how you can claim for January’s salary and any redundancy payment you may be due”.He added: “Like you, I loved The Pool and what it stood for, and I’m sorry that I let you and it down.

But in an age of predatory capitalism and rampant inequality, can one man’s modest suggestions really make much difference? By  Daniel CohenEvery Tuesday night, an email newsletter goes out to 13 million subscribers. It’s far more popular than Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop newsletter, which has 8 million, and the New York Times Morning Briefing, with 1.7 million. Its name, Money Saving Expert’s Money Tips, barely hints at the astounding range of tricks and deals contained within. Recent emails have featured “hacks” for cheaper meals at Nando’s and McDonald’s, deals on broadband and savings accounts, codes giving discounted access to airport lounges and an offer for free radiator heat-reflector pads.The newsletter looks like a relic from an earlier age of the internet: thousands of words, with no ads and few images. It began as an email that Martin Lewis – the personal finance journalist now better known as the Money Saving Expert – wrote for his friends. Today, it is the work of dozens of people at MoneySavingExpert, the website Lewis founded in 2003, which has become one of the 100 most popular sites in the UK, with 16 million visitors a month.The business of saving money has made Lewis extremely wealthy. After he sold the site in 2012 to the price-comparison firm MoneySupermarket for £87m, the Financial Times called him “the most successful journalist in the world, ever”. A year later, he was the seventh most Googled celebrity in the UK, nestled between Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.Lewis still worries over every line in the email each week. When I went to meet him on a Tuesday afternoon last July, he was studying the draft of that night’s newsletter, pondering aloud the merits of competing broadband deals. There was a gold piggy bank on his desk. It was the height of the heatwave, and Lewis, who is lean and often tanned, was dressed in the uniform of a sensible dad doing his best to enjoy a long-awaited summer holiday: a short-sleeved, stripy white shirt with a denim collar, denim shorts and the navy Skechers that he wore almost every time I met him.In our age of insecurity, Lewis stands out as a reassuring source of authority. Addressing a country that has never been comfortable talking about money, Lewis takes us by the hand and guides us through the bewildering world of finance. He comes across as a kind of double agent, who goes undercover among the powerful then reports back to the rest of society. It may feel as though banks, corporations and energy companies are lined up against the inidual, with few politicians willing to intervene, but Lewis’s work offers the alluring promise that in the battle between business and consumer, you can, with the right information, emerge the victor.Today, at 46, Lewis is a TV personality as much as anything. He appears weekly on Good Morning Britain and This Morning, while his primetime ITV programme, The Martin Lewis Money Show, regularly attracts around 4 million viewers.Lewis’s success depends on the trust he has built with the public, and he tends to this like an anxious parent. Everything featured on Money Saving Expert has been chosen by its editorial team, but once those recommendations have been decided on, the commercial team then tries to arrange deals with the companies offering the products. The site makes a commission when readers click on affiliated links for such products, which are marked with an asterisk. Still, when I joined Lewis for his meeting about the email, he was cautious. He worried that one description was too “selly”. “We don’t want people to think we’re advertising,” he said. A fidgety presence, he took great care with the recommendations, mindful of the impact they can have: Tesco Bank’s website once crashed when one of its savings accounts appeared in the email.With his fiery rhetoric, his efforts to defend the little guy against vested interests, Lewis may look like a populist. But, at heart, he has a technocratic temperament: he identifies specific problems, and tries to solve them with tweaks. On the rare occasions when he does speak out, it’s because he has decided the system has stopped working properly.Lewis is, in short, a centrist – perhaps the only truly popular centrist in Britain. Instead of seeking structural change, his formula combines educating the public with campaigning for small adjustments to the system. But at a time of growing inequality, with politicians unwilling or unable to hold corporations to account, is this enough? What is needed, the economist John Kay told me, “is not more information from the financial services industry, but actually an industry that is trustworthy and reliable”. The question remains whether Lewis’s approach is the best we can hope for, or a distraction from real change.There’s nothing new about wanting to save money. But now, a decade after the financial crisis, it feels particularly urgent. It’s clear that things will never go back to normal: the days of a secure job for life, with a steadily rising salary and a generous pension pot, are over. You won’t be able to support yourself through old age on your pension alone you might never make enough to afford your own home.You need to be prudent, but how? Since the deregulation and privatisations of the 1980s, we have had to make more and more financial decisions, and they have become dizzyingly complex. There are so many options: Britain has more than 300 banks, dozens of energy companies. Then there are all the credit cards, broadband providers, mobile networks. You know that if make the wrong choice you will get ripped off. It’s easy to panic or to bury your head in the sand.What has made Lewis so popular is that he offers a concrete response to this uncertainty. His work holds out the hope that you can take control of your finances and your life. This isn’t a question of stopping spending. “I don’t think being tight is a particularly sensible thing with money,” he told me. He wants to help people get more from the money they have, and reduce the stress that money can cause. The trick is to “play the system, understand how it works, get the best products” – to turn modern finance’s ersity to your own advantage, rather than being overwhelmed and exploited by it.In this respect, Lewis is less like a doctor, doling out pills for the patient to swallow, than a personal trainer: he promises to make you stronger through your own hard work. And no matter how little you understand at first, you can still judge his advice for yourself by its effect on your bank balance. This is what has saved Lewis from the fate of so many experts, who incur resentment by appearing to lord their expertise over everyone else. Instead of just telling you what to do, Lewis makes you feel as if you, too, can become a money-saving expert.When Lewis was in charge of Money Saving Expert, he worked up to 90 hours a week. Since selling the company, he has continued to play an important role, as executive chairman, and pictures of him wearing a confident expression appear all over the website like a talisman against profligacy. But even though he has cut down, to 50 or 60 hours, his schedule still appears exhausting in its variety and intensity. Rather than prioritising a particular audience, he addresses whoever he can, modulating his message each time like a shrewd ambassador for financial prudence. What matters to him is getting the word out. On a Monday morning last summer, I accompanied Lewis to ITV’s studios in west London for his appearance on This Morning. As he waited to go on set, he asked a member of the crew if she watched Love Island. She didn’t. “I’m thinking of doing Love Island this year,” he said. When his turn on This Morning came, he took questions about student finance from callers, staring intensely at the camera as he listened. As usual, he spoke in rapidfire bursts, slowing down theatrically for emphasis.After that, he got a motorbike taxi to Broadcasting House, the BBC headquarters, for his weekly Radio 5 Live phone-in. The segment was introduced with the song Bills, by the American singer LunchMoney Lewis, and as it played Lewis air drummed, bobbing his head. It was a longer slot than This Morning, with a more leisurely pace the callers seemed canny, and Lewis responded with a level of detail he tends to avoid on TV. That afternoon, he attended a meeting at the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, a charity that he founded in 2016, to carry out research and campaigns on the connection between mental illness and financial problems.The next day, Lewis met with Matt Hancock, who was then the culture secretary. It was a few weeks after Lewis had announced that he was suing Facebook for defamation, over fake adverts that featured his name and image, and the pair discussed online ads and scams. That evening, Lewis started tweeting about Love Island. “I’ve never watched before – I’m trying it this time – and yes I am intrigued,” he told his 566,000 followers. On Good Morning Britain that week, he referred to a Love Island contestant’s “semi-permanent Russian lashes”. When a presenter asked what made the lashes Russian, Lewis responded, “maybe they need to get them on quickly”. (He was once a finalist in a competition for young Jewish stand-up comedians.) He made a “ba-dum-tish” sound, with a drumming gesture, and walked off the set. Two days later, he wrote a comment piece for the Financial Times, proposing reforms to student finance.Lewis, who has a knack for remembering numbers, is happy to play the role of a financial savant in his TV appearances. “Is there something you don’t know? Anything you don’t know?” Angellica Bell, his co-host on The Martin Lewis Money Show, asked in a recent live special. But his displays of knowledge are mostly for show: their purpose is not so much to convey information as to demonstrate his mastery of the material, his fitness to instruct. His actual advice, on the other hand, is often surprisingly simple.Consider the “Money Mantras”, the cornerstone of the Money Saving Expert philosophy. Before buying anything, you ask yourself two questions. If you’re broke: “Do I need it? Can I afford it?” If you can afford the item: “Will I use it? Is it worth it?” If the answer to any of the questions is “No”, then it’s clear: don’t buy it.If that seems obvious, then Lewis’s prescription for budgeting is a little more technical. You do an audit of your outgoings, to establish how much you can actually afford to spend. Then you single out a few main categories: these might be bills, holidays, Christmas, savings and big purchases. You open a dedicated bank account for each of them, and use standing orders from your main account to ensure you’re setting aside what you need for every category. It’s fairly straightforward, but takes a lot of effort to set up – a day’s work, in Lewis’s estimation. He calls this technique “piggybanking”, with each account a different piggybank.Money Saving Expert has proved to be very effective at making money, yet Lewis considers it a public service above all. “This is a mission,” he says. “It’s a consumer website, but it’s not there to be all wonderful and give people what they want. All they would want is £10-off shopping vouchers, because they’re fun and most people don’t want to deal with their finances. And we have a job to twist their nipples in any way we can.”Lewis was born in Manchester in 1973 and spent most of his childhood in Delamere Forest in Cheshire, where his father ran a Jewish boarding school for pupils with special needs. Three days before Lewis’s 12th birthday, his mother was killed in a road accident. Losing a parent at a young age “gives you a drive,” he said in a talk in 2014. “Nothing is going to be quite as bad as it’s already been, so you can go for it.”After studying at the London School of Economics, Lewis spent two years working in financial PR, then moved into journalism. He got his first job on air when a cable channel devoted to finance, Simply Money, launched in 2000. Angela Rippon, the TV presenter who fronted the channel, told me that it was Lewis’s sketches that made him distinctive. Alongside his regular reporting, he dressed up as different characters – Dracula, a card dealer – in order to illustrate his points. One of Lewis’s strengths as a broadcaster is that he is not afraid to be naff – in fact, he revels in the naff. “It engaged the viewers in a way that financial reporting had never done before,” Rippon said. He has never been bothered by accusations that he is dumbing down. “I know I’m good at what I do,” he said. “For me, the passion is about reaching real people and getting them to be better on their finances.”In his first year at Simply Money, Lewis asked to be known on-screen as “the Money Saving Expert”. After the channel shut down, he kept the name, paid £100 to a web designer in Uzbekistan – his sole capital outlay in the decade that he owned Money Saving Expert – and launched the site in 2003.Back then, Lewis told me, media coverage of personal finance was limited to “investment, protection, and maybe mortgages if you want to be radical”. What he had in mind was something different: a one-stop shop that covered money as it works in everyday life. That meant advice on supermarkets (“eye-level products are where the profit is”) and where to get the cheapest DVD rentals and perfume. “He has taken it into getting a good deal in every single aspect of your life,” says Anne Ashworth, who edits the Times’s Money section. By moving beyond the constraints of traditional personal finance journalism, he became, more and more, a life coach.What was particularly striking about Lewis’s approach was how confrontational it was. Money Saving Expert’s home page used to have a promise for readers: “Companies try to screw us for profits. Money-saving shows you how to screw them back.” Journalists had long singled out firms that shortchanged their customers, but this was undiscriminating – it suggested that consumers couldn’t trust anyone. In The Money Diet, his 2004 guide to saving money, which doubles as a kind of early manifesto, Lewis argued that it was the job of businesses to make money – “nowt wrong with that”. But for that very reason, he wrote, “all companies are the enemy”.The tools offered by the site don’t always match up to this rhetoric. The Money Mantras alone won’t help you screw companies back. It takes real effort you have to exploit the loopholes identified by Money Saving Expert, and mop up one introductory offer after another. In the argot of the website, people who keep doing this by switching banks are approvingly referred to as “tarts”.Money Saving Expert quickly took off: by 2006, it was getting 1m visitors a month. As it expanded, Lewis’s profile grew. He got an ITV series another series, It Pays to Watch!, aired on Five in 2008, the year the global financial crisis inaugurated an era of perpetual insecurity. In 2012, when ITV launched The Martin Lewis Money Show, he finally got what he had spent years working towards: a programme at primetime. It airs on Mondays at 8pm, between episodes of Coronation Street. The show is centred on questions that Lewis takes from members of the public, at roadshows around the country. It’s slicker than his earlier programmes, but features the kind of sketches that he first tried out on Simply Money, giving it something of a variety-show feel.In June, Lewis recorded a live special of the show at Warwick Castle. A Martin Lewis Money Show flag, featuring coins, notes, credit cards and a piggy bank, flew from the tower. Lewis wandered around beforehand, looking a little nervous. He was more smartly dressed than usual, and boasted to the audience that he had bought his blazer in a sale. “We’re going to save millions of people lots of money,” he told them, “which is why I get out of bed in the morning.” During the show, Lewis reminded everyone going away that summer to pack their European Health Insurance Card by the end of the episode, the EHIC website had crashed.Lewis is fond of saying that he has never been interested in money he’s more interested in what having money allows you to do, and the problems that stem from not having it. He considers himself “a politician with a small p”, whose goal is to achieve “financial justice”. He has tried his best to do this while keeping out of the political fray. But over the past few years, that balancing act has become impossible. Reluctantly, Lewis has found himself dragged into politics.Lewis’s first campaign, in 2005, was against bank charges: the fees levied on customers who go beyond their overdraft limit. At the time, even if someone was just a penny over the limit, they usually had to pay their bank about £35. Since Lewis started campaigning against the charges, 7m template letters – which people fill in and send to their bank, in order to request that the charges be repaid – have been downloaded from Money Saving Expert and £1bn reclaimed. The campaign inspired a song, I Fought the Lloyds by Oystar, a comedy-rock band whose singer had used Money Saving Expert to challenge the charges. It charted at #No 25 and Lewis made a cameo in the video.Not long after that campaign, Lewis deployed similar tactics against banks that had missold payment protection insurance (PPI) to customers. This time, Money Saving Expert’s template letters resulted in as much as £5bn in compensation. More recently, Lewis has taken a different approach, by challenging the government itself. In 2011, soon after it was announced that university tuition fees would rise from £3,290 a year to a maximum of £9,000, Lewis was appointed head of the Independent Taskforce on Student Finance Information, which sought to explain what the new fees would involve. At the time, Lewis said he was “no fan of the changes”, but his priority was ensuring that everyone was properly informed about them. “There were people he could communicate with who wouldn’t have trusted politicians,” says David Willetts, the universities minister at the time.Lewis turned on the government when it froze the repayment threshold – the amount graduates need to earn before they start paying off their loans. Having been set at £21,000, this was meant to eventually increase every year, but in 2015 George Osborne backtracked. Lewis was appalled. In articles and TV appearances, he kept making his case he met with Jo Johnson, who was then the universities minister. In 2017, Theresa May finally relented: she announced the threshold would go up after all, to £25,000, and increase thereafter.Lewis’s journalism offers lessons in self-reliance, ways for iniduals to protect themselves. But he acknowledges that this isn’t always enough. “There are people out there who have less income than the basic minimum they need to subsist,” he says. As part of his efforts towards “financial justice”, he has pledged around £20m to charity.Perhaps Lewis’s most high-profile public intervention came last year, when he learned that his image was being used on targeted Facebook adverts without his consent. Many of them claimed he was endorsing bitcoin schemes that were actually fronts for ultra-high-risk investments one woman lost £100,000 as a result. Lewis approached Facebook about the ads but it failed to take any serious action, so he decided to sue.When he announced the lawsuit in April, it struck a nerve. The story made the front pages. Lewis was all over television, but he looked rattled. Unlike his previous campaigns, this one was personal and he didn’t enjoy the attention. “I do not handle stress particularly well. I am a very shy person,” he told me. Lewis is very protective of his privacy. He is married to Lara Lewington, a BBC presenter, with whom he has a six-year-old daughter. When I joined him on his walk to work, we didn’t meet at his home instead, I waited at a hotel nearby. When he eventually called me to arrange a meeting point, his number showed up as “No caller ID”.It’s tempting to see the Facebook lawsuit as a dramatic battle: Lewis, the people’s champion, taking on an unaccountable Silicon Valley behemoth. Even politicians unwilling to challenge the firm wanted him to play that role. “I have had, let’s say, very senior members of government who have pressured me and said: ‘Please don’t settle. Take it to court, set a precedent’,” Lewis said. Yet his aim was, as ever, more modest. “This is not an anti-Facebook campaign,” he told me, when we discussed the lawsuit last year. “This is an anti-scam ads campaign.” Last week, he announced that he was dropping the case because Facebook had agreed to introduce new measures tackling scam ads.There was a time when Lewis wanted to go into politics. At the LSE, he was elected head of the student union. He ran as an independent the union had previously been dominated by the far left, and Lewis promised to deliver “a student union for all”. Outside the LSE, Lewis was affiliated with the Lib Dems, and led the party in the National Union of Students. “I had no doubt he would go on to be a Lib Dem MP,” said Raj Jethwa, who ran against Lewis in the student union elections.It’s easy to imagine Lewis as an MP: he has the verbal tics of a modern politician, often starting his sentences with a “look” or “listen”. Even after setting up Money Saving Expert, Lewis still imagined he would eventually run for parliament. But when he hit his mid-30s, he decided he wasn’t suited to a career in politics. “I know I couldn’t cope with it,” he told me. “I’m nowhere near as a robust as I was when I was younger.”A few years ago, Lewis applied to be a cross-bench member of the House of Lords – a process open to anyone – and was rejected. He is keen to stress that he doesn’t identify as party political, though he has been approached by numerous parties, including United for Change, the new centrist party. He sees himself “somewhere from a wet Tory, a right Labour or a Lib Dem”. That outlook doesn’t always square with his more incendiary rhetoric. Throughout his career, Lewis has railed against the excesses of business, and seen first-hand how they can affect people he has attacked banks and energy companies. But while he seeks to empower inidual consumers, he stops short of calling for radical solutions that might level the playing field altogether: drastic regulation, or even nationalisation. His work seems to add up to a damning critique of the status quo, without seeking to fundamentally change it.Money Saving Expert operates according to the optimistic principle that if someone knows enough, they should be able to make the right decisions. When I went to events where Lewis was filming and spoke to the people in attendance, I was struck by how clued up they were. They had saved thousands through cashback services, or switching between credit cards – tricks they had learned from Lewis. But in their commitment to saving money, they were willing to put in the kind of time that most people just don’t have.Yet there is more to Lewis’s ambitions than simply educating people about money. He wants to change the way they think and talk about it. “If we take the American look at money, which is where money is just something open that you communicate about, I actually think that is healthier than our more British poe-facedness,” he told me.That reticence can have dire consequences. “I think some of the gender pay gap is because we don’t talk about salaries in this country,” Lewis says. Not discussing money also affects how much we spend on things. “If I don’t know how much you paid for your plumber, how do I know what I’m supposed to pay for my plumber?” Through his work, Lewis meets people with crippling debts, and sees the psychological toll that money can take. He can be emotional on screen, and open about his own vulnerabilities. When people are unable to talk about their finances, he says, it means they are unable to talk about the problems that stem from them. “That’s not good for our society.”That may be slowly changing. McFall notes that many younger people are open about the financial difficulties they face: their high student loan debt, the obstacles to buying a first property. “All of those things mean that financial details about how people live are in the public sphere in a way that they weren’t, historically,” she says. But Lewis thinks there is a long way to go. “We have got rid of the taboo of talking about sex and religion. And thankfully, we’re starting to get rid of the taboo of talking about your mental health. But money’s still there.”Lewis is constantly reminded that his work is incomplete. When I joined him on his walk to work, he told me about something he had recently overheard in a restaurant. A group of young professionals had been sitting near him, discussing which cards they use when they go overseas. “They were all getting it so wrong,” he said, as we walked down Oxford Street. “I found them painful.” He sounded personally affronted. I wondered why he cared so much about what other people did with their money. What was it about the conversation that he had found so painful? “Because it’s fact!” he said, his voice rising in exasperation. “It’s not opinion. It’s just a simple fact.” Like many experts, he seemed to feel that if people just listened to him, it would make everyone’s lives so much easier.This is the territory in which Lewis is still most comfortable: the realm of the indisputable, where one figure is higher than another, where there is no politics or emotion to complicate and corrupt. With money, countless things will always remain uncertain: which stocks will go up, say, or when to buy euros for your holiday. That’s not what Lewis is about. “People want to know what to invest in I don’t know,” he said. “But I do know what the best card to spend abroad is. Manifestly, directly, on a spreadsheet, no question. I know the answer.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6683b7c54a2dd7eb1ef6792c6b397513c9acfc20/339_0_2491_1495/master/2491.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b609ef7e9c6b92f160aa2f9373ec05de","title":"the r kelly conundrum does spotifys new mute button go far enough","story":"As many call for Kelly’s music to be removed altogether, the platform introduced a tool that puts the onus on to its usersSpotify’s recent introduction of a mute button might come across as just another innocuous tech feature rollout. But while it was added without fanfare, the timing – as many commentators have pointed out – is striking.The “don’t play this artist” button, which drives the application to skip songs by an artist of your choice wherever they appear, has been introduced in the wake of dream hampton’s explosive documentary, which delves into allegations that Kelly has been abusing women of colour – some whom were underage – for decades.While Kelly continues to deny allegations, and he has never been criminally charged, the attention drawn to them this decade – by way of a 2013 interview with Jim DeRogatis, who had been covering the story doggedly since the early 2000s a 2017 Buzzfeed investigation various activist movements led by women of colour and finally the documentary – has led to widespread outrage against not just Kelly, but the companies that continue to profit from his music.Then 27, Kelly allegedly marries protegée Aaliyah, then 15, in an illegal ceremony in Cook County, Chicago.Tiffany Hawkins files lawsuit alleging injuries and emotional damage from a three-year relationship with Kelly, beginning when she was 15 - it is settled out of court.A videotape passed to Chicago Sun Times journalist Jim DeRogatis appears to show Kelly urinating on and having sex with an underage girl, which Kelly denies.Patrice Jones alleges that Kelly had a sexual relationship with her than began when she was 16, and pressured her into terminating a pregnancy.

Prosecutors appeal for any further victims to come forward – three women come forward in the days that follow.Lady Gaga and Chance the Rapper apologise for working with R Kelly, and remove their collaborations from streaming services.The #MuteRKelly campaign began trending on Twitter in 2017, leading to a series of cancelled concerts, and now a petition calling for Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube to drop his music has gathered more than 160,000 signatures.It’s into this arena that the mute button arrives.The timing may or may not be a coincidence any company managing a piece of software as complex and widely used as Spotify will at any moment be juggling a slew of feature requests and bug reports. But while Spotify has not commented on its motivation, it wouldn’t be the first time that it has altered its offering in response to complaints about Kelly. In May last year, after Time’s Up’s women of colour subcommittee lent their support to the #MuteRKelly campaign, the company removed his songs from its playlist algorithms – part of the abortive implementation of a policy on “hate content and hateful conduct”.“We don’t censor content because of an artist’s or creator’s behavior, but we want our editorial decisions ... to reflect our values,” Spotify said at the time. “When an artist or creator does something that is especially harmful or hateful ... it may affect the ways we work with or support that artist or creator.” The decision was reversed a month later.As Vulture’s Dee Lockett explains, Spotify’s implementation of the mute button this month seems to have again been driven by activist groups – this time Color of Change, a US nonprofit that describes itself as a racial justice organisation, which has been pushing for Kelly’s complete removal from the streaming platform.While the mute button is being called “the R Kelly button” on Twitter, it’s not Spotify who will be pressing it: Kelly’s music remains on the streaming platform, where it is listened to by more than 5.3 million people every month – and there’s no suggestion that it will ever be removed.Instead, Spotify is employing a tactic tech companies and platforms have proved adept at: shifting responsibility on to users. As the term “platform” itself suggests, the business model is to provide a virtual space for users to generate content, and then to skim a little bit off the value of that content. It’s genius insofar as it provides a way for a company to make a lot of money while doing very little apart from developing software – which is, after all, what tech companies are supposed to be good at.What these companies are not good at, though, is dealing with the problems that arise in virtual spaces where users can basically do as they like. The reluctance of Facebook and Twitter to police their platforms has been well-documented, and has resulted in both sites becoming increasingly unpleasant spaces to spend time in. As they have grown, both companies have made concessions to the fact that they can’t simply abrogate responsibility for what’s on their platforms given how ripe for exploitation it makes them – but, in both cases, the horse has long since bolted.Spotify doesn’t have the same need for moderation as its peers – it removed direct messaging two years ago – but its refusal to block Kelly (and other high-streaming artists with allegedly violent pasts, such as XXXTentacion) demonstrates another cross-platform constant: these companies are never keen to kill their golden egg-laying geese. Donald Trump, for instance, violates Twitter’s terms of service pretty much every day, but Twitter has consistently refused to censure him. (When journalist Ashley Feinberg recently asked Twitters chief executive, Jack Dorsey, if there was anything Trump would do that could qualify as misuse – what would happen, for example, if the president “tweeted out asking each of his followers to murder one journalist”? – Dorsey’s response was not exactly definitive: “That would be a violent threat. We’d definitely ... we’d certainly talk about it.”)The question of whether Kelly’s music should be removed from Spotify ties into a debate as old as art itself: can you separate the art from the artist? It certainly isn’t easy when it comes to Kelly, whose songs and entire brand revolves around sex. At times, his lyrics seem to allude directly to his alleged behaviour: this is a man who has been accused of decades’ worth of sexual assaults against minors, and who sings a song whose lyrics include “Keep it on the downlow  Nobody has to know”. Separating his hypersexual art from the allegations levelled against him is almost impossible.And even if you believe Kelly’s alleged actions justify his banishment from public life, what about artists whose cases are less open-and-shut? As Pitchfork’s Jillian Mapes asked last year, do we really want companies like Spotify to act as the arbiters of taste and decency? What exactly are the criteria for being deemed not fit for the platform? How are actual convictions weighted against repeated allegations, and is there a statute of limitations? “Worth considering as well,” she writes, “are the racial biases that make artists of color far more vulnerable to arrests and convictions.” And on it goes.When Spotify backflipped on its conduct policy, it released a statement: “We don’t aim to play judge and jury ... our role is not to regulate artists.”But, clearly, that’s not always the case. In August last year, Spotify removed several Alex Jones podcasts for violation of hate speech guidelines. Its policy appears to be that it will police content but not conduct. The case of R Kelly shows the limits of this approach and while Spotify’s response – telling users “You deal with it” – is certainly the easiest way out of a complex situation, for many it’s not enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f391f450483f7dc35ad4da1496aa7e0d94d5393/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bfcc01a5b6906ad9026dddf9e6d6378","title":"two thirds of british children make music study finds","story":"Youth Music poll shows a massive rise in music-making among young people – especially among those from lower-income backgroundsNew research has found that more than two-thirds of young people are active musicians.The report’s authors argue it is vital “to make music an indispensable part of school life”. But they also acknowledge the potential in mobile video apps like TikTok, saying: “While there may not be a lot of music involved, the app encourages young people to be creative, autonomous and hone their performance skills, often in highly humorous ways.”Writing in the introduction to the report, Youth Music CEO, Matt Griffiths, outlines some of the problems around access to music for young people: “While we might have online access to more music than ever before, we still can’t afford to go to that festival, be a regular gig-goer, rehearse with a band or afford to buy that instrument we’ve always wanted. And if we’re at school, it’s getting increasingly more difficult to access music in the curriculum where its importance is in many cases being downgraded.”The report’s authors recommend that “public music education funds should be targeted towards those who face greatest barriers to access”, and “those involved in supporting young people’s wellbeing should give greater consideration to the role that music can play, and how young people’s passion for listening to music and their everyday creative lives can be interwoven with wider strategies to support good mental health.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e438fd3a9e2a7f0009581f1713fab34a06e6c096/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f58bf6fb7d61fa6722235cfd4cc88eb8","title":"could speaker john bercow block brexit podcast","story":"Today is the day that backbench MPs in parliament could wrestle control of the Brexit process away from the government.

Not even her South Northamptonshire constituents. She was the archetypal anonymous MP who’d made a career out of saying little and doing less. But then she came to public attention when she unexpectedly made it to the last two of the Tory leadership election after David Cameron resigned.Leadsom had started her campaign in exemplary fashion by keeping her mouth firmly shut and letting Stephen Crabb, Liam Fox and Michael Gove disqualify themselves by opening theirs. Things started to go wrong only when she began to raise her profile.First she announced she was going to be making a speech on the economy. This proved to be comedy gold, as she managed to talk for all of 20 minutes and didn’t get round to mentioning the economy once. Then she handed out pale blue #RALLY4LEADSOM T-shirts, which she’d just collected from Prontaprint, to the few dozen supporters who had come to hear her die on her feet, and led an Idiots’ Platoon march on Westminster.Joining her on the 400-metre stroll were the Brexiter deadbeats Tim Loughton and Theresa Villiers, who tried to keep spirits up with chants of “Who do we want? Andrea Leadsom! When do we want her? Sometime in September.” Once the unhappy few reached parliament, no one could quite remember what they were meant to be doing there and everyone shuffled away in a state of embarrassment. Days later, Leadsom gave an interview in which she claimed her main qualification to be prime minister was having had children, and her leadership campaign was over.You’d have thought that would have been that for Leadsom’s career. But in the ongoing straight-to-DVD horror movie of the post-Brexit Conservative party, being completely hopeless was more than enough to earn her a place in the cabinet. First as environment secretary, until it became clear that the outdoors was not her natural habitat, and then as leader of the Commons, a post usually earmarked for those being eased gently out of public life.Yet Leadsom has once again defied the odds by rising without trace. The allocation of parliamentary time for Brexit-related business has given the leader’s office unexpected prominence, and Leadsom now roams the Commons chamber with a sense of ownership. This is her time and she is enjoying every minute of it. She has become a role model for people with little ability everywhere. God stand up for mediocrities!In some ways Theresa May is making it easy for her. Since the prime minister really doesn’t know what she’s doing from one day to the next, it is a routine job for Leadsom to keep parliament in the dark about what the government is up to. Just before she got to her feet for her weekly Commons outing, she checked her diary. Completely blank. Perfect. Just as it should be.Everyone was very tired after being called upon to vote seven times on Tuesday, so she was going to make sure MPs had an easy schedule for the following week. On Monday there would be a general debate on sport: whether it was a good idea or not. Tuesday and Wednesday would be largely clear and on Thursday there would be another general debate, this time on antisocial behaviour: was it a good thing or a bad thing? Friday was free time.Having effectively given everyone a week off, Leadsom then proceeded to inform the house that it had been so late in handing in its Brexit homework that the February half-term was likely to be cancelled. All skiing holidays and winter breaks to the Canaries were off. Worried MPs could consult the bursar in regard to refunds, but she wasn’t making any firm promises either way as the house had brought this all on itself.Her Labour shadow, Valerie Vaz, was understandably a bit put out. Why hadn’t she said last week when she’d been asked about it? And why couldn’t they do more Brexit business next week, as there were still 600 statutory instruments to be tabled and debated? How confident on a scale of one to 10 was she that the government would get everything done before 29 March?Leadsom peered over the top of her glasses. It was precisely that kind of snippy attitude that had led her to dispense with half-term. And no, she couldn’t say when the house was going to next have a chance to talk about Brexit. Nor could she promise they would do so during the February detention. Instead, there would be more generic debates. Which make the best pets: dogs or cats? Discuss.Parliament had to learn, and learn fast. The point of the next two months wasn’t for everyone to sit around and do nothing. It was for them to sit around and be seen to be doing nothing. End of lesson. Back to work. Not that anyone had any.

Despite the strong preference for the model from some Brexiters, May’s Chequers plan decided on a different customs model given the unpredictability around the technology.There is some optimism in government however that since that was rejected by May and by Brussels as unworkable, attitudes have begun to shift on both sides.The political declaration and the January letter from Donald Tusk, the European council president, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, have an explicit reference to alternative arrangements, sources point out. Whitehall sources believe that those solutions now have “more currency” than when they were discussed early last year.Others in government and in Brussels are more sceptical that the as-yet-unknown technology would prevent the need for additional customs checks or border infrastructure.The business secretary, Greg Clark, one of the cabinet ministers who examined the max-fac model early last year, said he was wary of the proposal. “I can’t see that those technical possibilities are there yet,” he told ITV.The EU’s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, has previously said the required technology does not exist, and negotiators had “looked at every border on this Earth, every border EU has with a third country – there’s simply no way you can do away with checks and controls”.Sources in the meeting with May described it as “a positive start” and said it had an atmosphere intended to engender trust between two previously warring factions. “We had the right people in the room, talking about the right bits of detail,” one MP said. “There is a degree of trust there now because everyone is taking a risk by being there.”Though Downing Street has been willing to take a serious look at the first element of the Malthouse compromise, there appears to be less willingness to countenance the second part of the plan – effectively a three-year transition to no deal – and no optimism the EU would allow such a thing to happen.Speaking earlier, Hunt suggested that Clark’s pessimism about the lack of technology to facilitate such a smooth border process was a personal opinion and said the government should welcome the consensus in the party.Pressed on what alternative arrangements the government would be proposing to the EU, Hunt said: “We have put these proposals together, we have to work them up, we have to go through them in detail with our partners in the EU … It is going to take a few days to do that.”The foreign secretary, speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, conceded that a delay might be necessary if an agreement with the EU was reached just days before the March deadline – although the prime minister has consistently ruled out seeking any extension.Insiders suggested that the foreign secretary’s remarks were unhelpful, although they appeared to be accurate because there will come a point in March where it will no longer be possible to ratify a deal in time for the end of the month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94adc53725b68c4794d11c629bcf078bbbc5485d/0_313_4848_2909/master/4848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a4a32cdbfc913523c91b693d8a997a","title":"the brexit delusion may to demand the impossible politics weekly podcast","story":"Jessica Elgot is joined by Polly Toynbee, Martin Kettle and Aarti Shankar to discuss the latest round of fantasy Brexit.

We plan to keep them open until about 5.30pm.In the comments BTL readers often complain that Brexiters don’t have solutions to the problems generated by the vote to leave the EU in 2016 that they supported. In the interests of objectivity, I offer you two articles out today showing that, actually, they are bursting with creative ideas.If even an invisible Irish border is unacceptable to the EU, another option is available: a customs territory comprising the UK and Ireland. The republic could remain in the EU but leave its customs union, agreeing instead a common commercial policy including matching tariffs with the UK. This would protect Irish consumers and businesses: the republic imports more from the UK than from any EU country, and the UK is its second biggest European export market. It would also support Irish exports: 85 per cent of its freight trade to the continent uses British ports.What to do about the coming shortage of green groceries of which several supermarkets warned yet again this week if there is a no-deal Brexit on 29 March? I am just old enough to remember when fresh fruit and veg were in short supply at this time of year. People used to know how to store things to mitigate the problem: apples would be carefully laid out on straw-strewn shelves. We ate lots of root vegetables and not much greenery. If ever you saw a strawberry out of season it came, for some reason, from Israel. Perhaps it is time for a Brexit recipe book, like those comforting wartime rationing ones full of bright ideas for dull things. In our part of the south coast we have racier ideas. We have a centuries-old tradition of smuggling (‘brandy for the parson, baccy for the clerk’), and are ready to set out in our little ships to Dunkirk or wherever and bring back luscious black-market lettuces and French beans, oranges and lemons. Our Sussex and Kent smugglers used to be known as ‘free traders’, which is interesting and — if we have to sneak over an EU tariff wall — entirely appropriate for today.This is from Mark Rutte, the Dutch PM.EU officials fear Theresa May is setting the UK on course for a no-deal exit at the end of June because she will not have the political courage to ask for the longer Brexit delay they believe she needs, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports.Downing Street’s attempts to win over Labourleft support for Theresa May’s Brexit deal seems to be running into some resistance. Some Labour MPs are urging colleagues not to be taken in by what they describe as a potential “bribe”. (See 2.23pm.) And now the TUC has issued a rather critical statement after talks today between trade union and Cabinet Office officials.The talks were triggered by the government’s admission that it wants to offer more guarantees about workers’ rights after Brexit. The Labour MP John Mann tabled an amendment during the main debate on May’s Brexit deal, and the government welcomed it. After her deal was defeated, May said offering more on workers’ rights was one of the three changes she needed to make to get her deal through parliament.In his interview on ITV’s Peston last night Greg Clark, the business secretary, stressed the importance of getting Labour MPs to support the deal when he said he hoped it would pass by a “substantial majority”. He said:If we are to properly move forward I don’t think we should aim for this deal to pass by a majority of one or two, you saw when the referendum result happened, how that didn’t solve … I would like to see a substantial majority for a deal, that requires understanding.Mathematically, a “substantial majority” would be impossible without May attracting a hefty chunk of opposition support.But, after today’s talks, the TUC issued a statement implying the government offer on workers’ rights did not go far enough. A TUC spokesperson said:Unions are always willing to meet with ministers and officials to represent the interests of working people. But we’re not prepared to settle for warm words or half measures from government.Our movement has been clear that working people need a binding guarantee for their rights, now and into the future. We won’t support a Brexit deal which fails this test, and the government has come nowhere close to meeting it.The strongest possible protection for workers’ rights would come from sticking by single market and customs union rules.Jeremy Corbyn has also been giving interviews about Brexit. Asked if he thought that Theresa May was listening to his ideas when they met yesterday afternoon to discuss Brexit, he replied:Well, she was sitting opposite me and somebody next to her was making notes of what I said and somebody sitting next to me was making notes on what she said - so I hope she was listening. I set out quite clearly what I thought was a credible way forward, which is to negotiate a comprehensive customs union with the EU to protect our trade interests and our jobs, our access to the market and, crucially, legally-binding protections of consumer, environmental and workers’ rights.Jeremy Corbyn was forced to take a car to Derbyshire to speak about cuts to bus services - after the one he was waiting on failed to show up. As the Press Association reports, Corbyn met residents and community leaders in Ilkeston on Friday and planned to use a service that had suffered from a reduction in funding. Despite saying he was “stoic” and would “see it through”, he was forced to catch a lift to the Kirk Hallam Community Centre from Nottingham to ensure he was not late. Speaking at the bus stop in Nottingham, Mr Corbyn told the Press Association: We’ve been waiting 25 minutes for the bus - it was due at 42 (past the hour) and I look over there and it says 11.07am - and it has even disappeared off the information board. So I don’t know what has happened to this bus but we’re stoic, we’ll wait, we’ll see it through. But I think this kind of proves our point about private operators running buses and not doing it terribly well.Derek Mackay, the Scottish government’s finance minister, says he has struck a deal with the Scottish Greens to get his budget through Holyrood. (See 9.51am and 2.01pm.)And here is the BBC’s Sarah Smith on the deal.The Labour MP Wes Streeting says his colleagues should not be tempted by the suggestion that, if they vote for the Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the government will increase spending on their communities. (See 12.26pm.) In a statement issued by the People’s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, he said:Today the Downing Street spin machine has briefed journalists that the government would consider offering extra money to coalfield communities and a strengthening of workers’ rights if Labour MPs voted for Brexit.It’s a promise not worth the newsprint it is printed on. Not just because every analysis, including the government’s own, shows that Brexit will leave us worse off and result in the government having less money to spend, but also because, as the analysis published by the People’s Vote campaign shows, the Brextremists on the Tory benches on whom she is now actively appeasing, will never stand for it.Their real agenda is to slash workers’ rights, to weaken trade unions and to open up our public services to untrammelled market forces. They are fully paid-up members of the Donald Trump fan club and committed enemies of any social dimension in market regulation and service provision.For Labour MPs to align themselves with the likes of Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith and Priti Patel on Brexit would be a mistake that would rank alongside Ramsay MacDonald’s 1931 creation of a ‘national’ government. It would never be forgiven and never be forgivable.The Labour MP David Lammy has posted a more succinct version of the same response on Twitter.And the Labour MP Anna Turley has also condemned what the government is reported to be planning. Also just published is the Department for Education’s no-deal advice to universities, most of it involving who is eligible for study and financing via student loans, including EU citizens already in the UK and those wanting to come after Brexit.One interesting nugget in the advice is: “Entitlement to student finance and home fees status for EU students starting a course at an English institution in academic years after the 2019 to 2020 academic year, is under consideration.” Should the UK’s exit be delayed, that leaves open the possibility that universities may be able to recruit EU-based students and offer home tuition fees backed by student loans, for at least one more year.With just an hour to go until the debate on the Scottish budget (see 9.51am), it was confirmed talks are still taking place between Derek Mackay, the Scottish government’s finance secretary, and the Scottish Greens, the Press Association reports. A government source said: “We will hopefully get a deal by the end of the day, but we will see where we get to.” Discussions over the last 48 hours have been “intense”, he added, saying: “We’re not taking anything for granted but we are hopeful we can reach agreement.” With improved funding for local government one of the key demands from the Greens, the source said ministers are “very open” to the idea of allowing councils to introduce a levy on hotel rooms.First minister’s questions in the Holyrood chamber focused on concerns about a third infection outbreak in a Glasgow hospital, which has been linked to the deaths of two premature babies, and homelessness. There was a brief mention of the budget – to be voted on later and as yet the SNP’s minority government has not found the support it needs to pass its spending plans – with Nicola Sturgeon saying she was “hopeful” that a deal would be reached in time with the Scottish Greens.Earlier in the day, the deputy first minister John Swinney confirmed the suspension of an inquiry into whether Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code during the Scottish government’s investigation into sexual harassment allegations made against Alex Salmond.He said it had been agreed that the inquiry, which will be led by Ireland’s former chief prosecutor James Hamilton, should be deferred while criminal investigations against Salmond are active. He added that the Scottish government’s review of the application of its procedure for handling complaints about ministers or former ministers would also “not be progressed at this stage”. Sturgeon referred herself for investigation earlier this month after questions over whether she had breached the code by failing to declare five meetings and phone calls with Salmond last year.Schools may need to be “flexible” to provide school lunches in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Department for Education has told schools and colleges in England in its EU exit advice note out today. It says:The government, including the Department for Education, will continue to work with food suppliers to prepare for a no deal departure from the EU. Schools have significant flexibilities within the school food standards. Local authorities and schools must exercise their power to provide meals to all registered pupils who request one.The DfE’s advice means schools could ignore guidelines on nutrition and content if there are shortages, rewinding Jamie Oliver’s good work and suggesting it could be back to processed potato waffles and chicken nuggets for British school children.Schools are also told that hiring teachers from abroad will get more difficult because their qualifications may not be automatically recognised. “In a no deal scenario, the current system of reciprocal recognition of professional qualifications between the EU, EEA EFTA and Switzerland and the UK will not apply after 29 March 2019,” the department states, although teachers who have already had their qualifications recognised in the UK will not be affected.For school trips, the DfE notes that there are “a number of issues you will need to be aware of when planning travel to the EU for staff or students,” including passport duration.During business questions in the Commons Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the Conservative MPs who supported the Yvette Cooper amendment intended to give MPs the chance to firmly block a no-deal Brexit, asked what would happen if another government Brexit deal gets voted down by 13 February. Theresa May has said that, if there is no new deal by 13 February, she will give MPs a vote on an amendable motion on 14 February, which would allow them a new vote on Cooper-type amendment. But if MPs have voted down a deal by then, would they still get a further vote on an amendable motion, Letwin asked.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said it was “very difficult” for her to say what would happen in the event of a deal being voted down for a second time.Given that, ahead of the first vote, MPs voted for an amendment to the business motion that ensured that they did get a vote afterwards on what was going to happen next, it is hard to imagine that not happening again. But the Conservative MP Nick Boles, who came up with what ultimately became the Cooper amendment in the first place, said he thought Leadsom’s answer was worrying.The announcement that the Commons recess may be cancelled coincided with the publication today of a report from the Institute for Government (pdf) looking at whether the government is ready for a no-deak Brexit. The IfG says it is “increasingly unlikely” that all the legislation could pass in time. It says:It looks increasingly unlikely that the prime minister will be able to get the six outstanding Brexit bills through parliament in time. Some of the major bills still have not started their Lords stages – where the government does not control time. Any piece of legislation can become a target for people wanting to frustrate the government’s intentions.The government is also behind on secondary legislation. Despite a major push from government departments, only around 100 of the 600 statutory instruments required for a no deal Brexit have made their way through parliament.Almost half are yet to be tabledLegislation can theoretically be rushed through parliament, but that would bypass important scrutiny and, most importantly, require a stable majority – something the government cannot currently bank on. That means there is a very significant risk that the laws that need to be in place for a no deal Brexit will not be on the statute book. Overall, the report is damning. Bronwen Maddox, the IfG’s director, told the BBC that the UK is “not ready for no deal”, adding: The disruption from no deal - simply from the lack of preparation - would be extremely damaging. It cannot be dismissed as a mere blip.Jeremy Corbyn has been visiting Ilkeston today. Asked about the reports about the government proposing to shovel cash at Labour leave areas in the hope of getting extra votes for the Brexit deal (see 12.26pm), he said he would be happy to see these communities get more investment, but that this would be more likely under a Labour government. He said:I think they should look at the needs of their constituencies - of course, every MP should do that and demand appropriate resources for their constituencies. Many, particularly from mining areas, have been disgracefully treated by this Tory government and indeed previous ones - ever since the miners’ strike in the 1980s. Clearly, there has to be investment in those communities - but the Brexit plan proposed by Theresa May doesn’t solve that any more than the government’s austerity programme is going to solve any of that.I simply say to people, if you voted leave or voted remain, your need for a government who will invest in your communities are exactly the same - we need a government that is going to invest in communities and create good-quality, secure jobs.Corbyn also rejected the suggestion that Labour’s opposition to the government’s Brexit policy had been ineffective. As the Press Association reports, when asked why he thought Labour had not laid a glove on the government despite the difficulties the Tories were in, he replied:Hang on, they were defeated on a notion from us on contempt of parliament. They were defeated on their Brexit plan, they were forced to hold a meaningful vote by Labour action. They were forced to bring forward proposals to grant a European Union citizen’s right to stay in Britain.That is Labour taking them to task in parliament, the fact that the media choose not to report what Labour says is not my fault."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24772031343bcbffa31b6e39a36c2a9187871072/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f67364496a27a1bcaf0edbd136cfd203","title":"when light meets liquid the 3d printer replicating art","story":"Researchers in the US create detailed objects using video images and light-sensitive polymerIt is no rival for the replicator that whips up meals on demand on the USS Enterprise, but it can transform gloop into useful objects and even works of art, such as miniature versions of Rodin’s Thinker.The real-world version of the replicator, nicknamed after the handy 24th-century appliance, churns out detailed 3D shapes and components by beaming images of them on to a rotating container filled with a gooey liquid that reacts to light.Researchers used the new 3D printing process to make model jaws, little planes and bridges, and more complex structures such as a ball inside a cage. In footage from the scientists’ lab, objects emerge from the light-sensitive fluid fully formed in under two minutes.Christopher Spadaccini, at the US government’s Lawrence Livermore National Lab, said he was surprised at how well the first objects turned out. “We all knew right away we had something pretty exciting.”Traditional 3D printers build structures layer by layer, but this can leave tiny steps running up the sides of the printed objects. Another drawback is that certain shapes, such as arches, need supports to fill the gaps as the structure is built up. The new process, called computed axial lithography, produces objects with smooth surfaces and removes the need for supports.To print an object, the scientists start with a 3D representation either from a scan or a drawing on a computer. This is converted into a sequence of video images that show what the object looks like from different angles. A projector then beams the images one after another on to the rotating container filled with thick, light-sensitive polymer. The images change thousands of times during a single revolution.“As the container rotates, the pattern that’s projected changes, so over time the amount of light that each point receives can be controlled,” said Hayden Taylor at the University of California, Berkeley. Spots that receive a lot of light solidify, while those that do not remain liquid.“The key thing is that the video being projected is perfectly synchronised with the rotation of the container,” said Indrasen Bhattacharya, also at Berkeley. “At every particular angle you choose a particular image to project.”In the lab it took less than a minute for the printer to create a 2cm-high figure of Rodin’s sculpture The Thinker. The largest item they have made is about 10cm with features as small as 0.3mm. The gloop left over from each print run is drained off and reused, said Hossein Heidari, a co-author on the study published in Science. The researchers are now exploring what products they can make and how big. Beyond scale models for designers, dental implants and medical prostheses are on the cards. But the process can also print on top of existing objects, so could add customised ergonomic handles to tools and sports equipment, and in the future, perhaps even print clear, soft hydrogels around tiny electronic circuits to make smart contact lenses.Ian Campbell, who works on computer-aided product design in the Additive Manufacturing Research Group at Loughborough University, said the idea of “volumetric 3D printing” has been around for some time, but this was the first system he had seen that used multi-angle projections to make complex objects.“The key advantages are reduced time and no supports being required. However, the second of these advantages depends on the high viscosity of the resin material used,” he said. If the light-sensitive liquid is not thick enough, parts of the object that solidify first might simply sink to the bottom of the container.The main limitation of the process is that photoreactive polymers can be expensive and are not generally used to manufacture actual products. “Nevertheless, these materials have proved very effective for prototype production and this new system could also fit into this segment of the 3D-printing market,” he said.“The system would need to be scaled up to be of commercial benefit to most companies but could be of immediate use to companies requiring small models, such as in the dental and jewellery industries,” Campbell added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f8fb18a0c748eb1a07710ef4272723b424cd167/0_383_5759_3457/master/5759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91c7c36d06483573983e41718aab4f05","title":"how greater manchester is taking on rough sleeping pilot social bond wigan","story":"Pilot funded via social bond has had particular success in Wigan, where numbers have almost halvedNumbers of those sleeping rough have stabilised or declined in eight out of 10 Greater Manchester boroughs. There has been particular success in Wigan, where the number has almost halved from 30 to 17, year on year.One of those was Pete Smith, 34, who moved into his own home last summer after six months living in a tent with his dog. A keen angler, he often pitched up by fishing ponds at nightfall, stashing his tent in a bush most days. Amphetamines, crack cocaine and cannabis passed the time, along with alcohol. If there was food, his dog ate first: Smith, a pseudonym, was down to eight stone (51kg) by the time he accepted accommodation last year from the Brick, a homeless charity in Wigan.He is one of 246 entrenched rough sleepers helped into homes over the last 12 months under a payment-by-results pilot in Greater Manchester. It is funded via a “social impact bond” (SIB), whereby social investors provide upfront investment and receive a return dependent on the results achieved.So far just two participants in the SIB are back on the street, according to Sarah Cooke, who runs the project. Many others have had wobbles, Smith included, but the SIB is designed to give people “not just a second chance”, but “third, fourth, fifth chances” when they struggle in their new homes. They do not have to overcome substance use before they are given a roof over their head. First they get the keys, then they are given intensive support to sustain a tenancy and tackle their problems, plus help to access education and training.Smith, who grew up in care, had been homeless on and off since 2007, when his relationship broke down. By the time he engaged with the SIB last summer he had been in prison three times. Jail was sometimes a welcome respite from life on the streets, he said. “Three square meals a day, free gym access … it was more of a detox for me than anything else.”Accepting help from the Brick was daunting. “I struggled at first because I was that used to being on my own. It was just me and the dog. It was frightening, having responsibilities.” But he wanted to sort himself out, primarily because of his 14-year-old daughter. “She’s of an age now where anything I do directly affects her … It weren’t great for her, with her friends. That’s why I had to make some drastic changes in my life. It can’t be nice going to school and people asking: is that your dad there, sleeping in that field?”First he moved into supported accommodation with five other men in the same boat. It took some adjustment. “When I first moved in, I slept on the floor for about the first week. Stupid as it sounds, the bed was too soft,” Smith said. Part of his SIB deal was to go to the Brick’s Wigan hub five days a week, where he learned skills including joinery and did courses in first aid and health and safety.In November he was deemed ready to have his own place: a social home in Leigh. He was given basic furniture and a “personalisation budget” to make it his own, plus vouchers for the supermarket.There are ups and downs: recently Smith stopped engaging with his care workers, who have been working hard to get him back on track. But he said he was determined to stay off the streets, motivated by a speech his daughter gave at a recent family funeral. “She stood up and said: ‘I hope you’re all as proud of my dad as I am.’ It was the best thing I’ve ever heard in my life. If that won’t motivate you, nothing will.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf1876af4590026b32fc0f38a1eaeaec54288d1/0_183_3830_2298/master/3830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0693288d076336faa6a068d3d1a8fb24","title":"england ireland six nations manu tuilagi elliot daly rugby union","story":"England have flown into a wintry Dublin firmly believing they can kick off the Six Nations by overpowering Ireland on the opening weekend. With Manu Tuilagi set to start in the championship for the first time in six years, their head coach, Eddie Jones, insists the visitors can upset the defending champions and register a first victory at the Aviva Stadium since 2013.No one in the England setup expects anything but a brutally tough contest on Saturday but Jones, having retained Elliot Daly at full-back and opted for the Saracens lineout specialist George Kruis in the second row, insists his team should not be cast as underdogs in Dublin. “I’d hate to go into a game thinking we weren’t better than the opposition, that we need surprises or tricks to win the game,” said Jones. “We don’t need that. Praise can make you weak but the good teams always expect to win and play well and that’s what we are.”England, nevertheless, are braced for a serious examination at the breakdown and in the air, with Exeter’s Jack Nowell picked on the wing in anticipation of a fiercely physical contest. “He’s a street-fighter, mate,” said Jones. “When you go to Dublin it’s not going to be a nice game. It’s going to be a tough old match. It is well documented no one thinks we can win but I can tell you everyone inside our camp believes we can.”Give or take the unfit Ben Te’o, who would have played had he not suffered a side strain in training, this is definitely not an England side lacking in physical clout. The pack collectively weighs almost 150 stone and never before have England been able to field two Vunipolas, Maro Itoje and Tuilagi in the same XV.With Owen Farrell starting at fly-half and the rumbustious ball-carrying trio of Ellis Genge, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Nathan Hughes on the bench it is a side well equipped for a slugfest but Jones is equally aware of the need for precision in certain key areas, not least beneath the inevitable high balls set to be hoisted into the Dublin sky by Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton.It must have been a tight call but, ultimately, Jones has kept faith in Daly despite a couple of hairy moments in the autumn Tests and omitted Mike Brown from his matchday 23. “We feel that Elliot will do the job for us and he gives us a great attacking game,” said the head coach. “Having dropped a couple of balls is not an indication to me he hasn’t done well. Elliot is a great catcher of the ball and we’ve got every bit of confidence in him.”Nowell’s deceptive strength in and around the tackle area will also come in useful against an Irish side that Jones accepts will be a serious handful around the breakdown. “The number of poaches Ireland have attempted at the tackle almost doubled in the autumn. They’re a much more aggressive side at the tackle contest and that’s going to be a key area.”Kruis will be invited to help neutralise the lineout threat posed by Devin Toner, James Ryan and Peter O’Mahony. If it is tough on Joe Launchbury, omitted from the squad altogether, there is a certain logic in relying on the tried and tested Saracens combination of Kruis, Itoje and thrower Jamie George.Will it all be sufficient to beat last year’s grand slam winners? Amid all the bullish rhetoric it is easy to forget Tuilagi’s last four Test starts for England have all ended in defeat and that he has never started alongside Henry Slade in a competitive fixture. Even those who have argued for the past three or four years that Slade and Tuilagi would make a perfect midfield combo would ideally have preferred their first date to be somewhere other than Dublin against settled, tactically savvy Irish opponents.Slade, even so, can hardly disguise his excitement. “I’ve played most of my best rugby when I’ve had a centre partnership where we complement each other. If you want a big carrier winning collisions in tight traffic then I’m not your man – but those are Manu’s strengths and hopefully my strengths cover his weaknesses as well. It’s a good match. If you run into him you get smoked. His legs are so big … when I play against him and try to tackle him I just grab one of them.”It all makes for an enticing prospect which could shape the entire tournament.With Newcastle’s Mark Wilson moving to blindside flanker, there are a total of six changes and one positional switch from the starting England side that beat Australia 37-18 in November, plus a potential first cap off the bench for the Wasps scrum-half Dan Robson.Jones fully anticipates Ireland being smart and resourceful – “It’s not the old kick-off, distract the referee and then put the boot in … that’s not the sort of rugby it is anymore” – but his heavy-duty England selection will not surrender meekly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f37025e8d64de01a0dbcaf96596f103dc12124cc/121_180_3242_1945/master/3242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56d89f4b1d2349ac5f29aed3a077616f","title":"st helens derby win wigan super league match report","story":"If this is a sign of things to come for the next nine months, then perhaps this truly is a new beginning for Super League after all. In the end, it was St Helens who claimed the first bragging rights of 2019, ensuring that Wigan remain on minus two points for at least a week following the revelation on the eve of the season that the reigning champions had been found guilty of breaching the salary cap in 2017.Thankfully, however, that particular scandal was overshadowed in some style here, despite it inevitably capturing the headlines in the 24 hours leading up to kick-off. Granted, St Helens-Wigan derbies have rarely lacked in intensity or entertainment, but on the night when Super League entrusted two of its most famous clubs to start its self-titled new era with a bang, how they delivered in abundance.Already, even after just one game, it is clear that the introduction of a shot clock – aimed at reducing needless stoppages in a game which prides itself on its pace – is going to go a long way towards fulfilling the image the Super League chief executive, Robert Elstone, craves for the competition. This was about as strong a start to the new season as he could have hoped for.In fact, at half-time it seemed that Super League’s other key new ruling for 2019, the introduction of golden point extra-time, was a distinct possibility given how the scores were tied after a pulsating opening half. Played at breakneck pace with minimal stoppages, Wigan fought back magnificently from an early 12-0 deficit to level proceedings at the whistle.Fittingly, it was one of the headline recruits who struck the first blow of the new season. The Fiji captain, Kevin Naiqama, is one of several big names to arrive in Super League this year, and after three minutes he barged his way over the line to break the deadlock. Ten minutes later, Saints doubled their lead when a fine break from Dom Peyroux was finished by Jonny Lomax.Mark Percival converted both to make it 12-0, but the Warriors soon found their feet. As half-time approached, Ben Flower crashed over on the angle to halve the deficit before Liam Marshall instinctively picked off a Lachlan Coote pass to race the length of the field. Zak Hardaker – who had a quiet night on his competitive return to rugby league – made it 12-12.Half-time did little to halt the intensity from either side, too – and it would take a remarkable piece of inidual skill to break the deadlock. With defence impressively on top in light of the reduction in interchanges from 10 to eight, the home side eventually went back ahead when Regan Grace produced an outstanding flying finish in the corner to make it 16-12.Wigan, much to their credit, battled valiantly in an attempt to level the scores once again, but there would be no comeback this time. There were half-chances for the visitors in the closing stages, but as the minutes whittled down, and the effects of a bruising night began to become visibly apparent on the players, it was St Helens’ talismanic captain, James Roby, who guaranteed victory, scampering over from dummy-half.New beginnings for Super League, but in terms of Roby’s impact for his hometown club some things, it seems, are destined to remain the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a04d16c43a056075bff6d70f984da817fa2698a/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f64021244dbdf999d67bcefa4f072680","title":"facebook and twitter removed hundreds of accounts linked to iran russia and venezuela","story":"The Facebook accounts had garnered about 2 million followers and researchers say they amplified anti-west viewsFacebook and Twitter both announced on Thursday they had taken down hundreds of accounts believed to have been part of coordinated influence operations from Iran, Russia and Venezuela.Facebook removed 783 pages, groups and accounts that it said posed as local actors in countries across Europe, the Middle East and south Asia and shared content that was largely repurposed from Iranian state media. The accounts, some of which had been active since 2010, had garnered about 2 million followers on Facebook and more than 250,000 followers on Instagram.While Facebook demurred from ascribing a motive to the operation, researchers with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab who analyzed the accounts said that it appeared designed to amplify views “in line with Iranian government’s international stances”.“The pages posted content with strong bias for the government in Tehran and against the ‘West’ and regional neighbors, such as Saudi Arabia and Israel,” the researchers wrote in a blog post.Several of the accounts focused on sharing pro-Palestinian or anti-Israeli content, in French, English, Spanish and Hebrew. Many advanced pro-Iran, anti-Saudi Arabia messages to a largely Middle Eastern, Arabic-speaking audience. One targeted an English-language audience and posted 911 conspiracy theories.The accounts purchased less than $30,000 in advertising on Facebook and Instagram, the company said. They also promoted eight “events” since May 2014, but Facebook said it could not confirm whether the events had actually taken place.Separately, Twitter announced that it had deleted thousands of “malicious” accounts from Russia, Iran and Venezuela. The accounts had “limited operations” targeting the US midterm elections in November, the company said, and the majority were suspended prior to election day.Twitter identified two operations in Venezuela. The first involved 764 accounts and distributed “spammy content focused on isive political themes”. The platform was not able to “definitively” attribute the activity to a government-backed influence campaign, but said it removed the accounts anyway.The second Venezuelan campaign involved 1,196 accounts, which Twitter said appeared to be part of a state-backed influence campaign targeting Venezuelans.The takedowns were “an encouraging example of the type of collaboration we’re trying to build across industry”, said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, on a conference call with reporters.Gleicher said that Facebook had acted in part on information shared with the company by Twitter. Facebook also had its own ongoing investigation into inauthentic behavior from Iran, having previously announced account takedowns in August and October of 2018.Gleicher said that Twitter had shared information about the Venezuelan influence operations, and that Facebook was now “investigating those leads”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d91fe2301f0cf6fbedd305de497e41ea937e4bd/0_0_4708_2826/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fa853a64dad203084aeb1879d08dd5b","title":"send a tip on a living museum in the uk for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about an immersive museum or historic site you’ve visited in the UK that brings the past to life.

The circular trek peaks three times – each at over 5,000 metres – and is regarded as the highest trek in Peru. I completed the circuit at 16 and while fit, I was hardly a finely tuned athlete. But acclimatising to altitude is essential. You are rewarded with some of the most stunning scenery in the world – with plenty of glaciers and cobalt-blue lakes. It’s a five-night camping trip so it’s handy there are several hot springs en route for bathing. We travelled from Cusco having spent three days acclimatising there, taking a three-hour drive to the start of the trek (4,000 metres) in Tinqui. We went with Outlook Expeditions, who put us in touch with a local guide. FreyaLie back and enjoy the glow-worms, they said, and they were right. Black water rafting in the underground cave system in Waitomo, North Island, is such fun that once won’t feel like enough. We were guided through the caves in provided wetsuits, holding onto our rubber tyres as we zip-wired from one cave system to another. We then plunged into pools to float and glide effortlessly along the subterranean stream. And to top it off, looking up, it’s not stars that you see but hundreds of glow-worms shining brightly on the cave roof. • Tour from NZ$125 (around £65), waitomoPaulLast April, I enjoyed a trek in the central desert in Iran (Dasht-e Kavir) where, with a local guide, I encountered amazing scenery, lots of wild camels, lizards and mindblowingly stark, empty salt flats. I camped and stayed in local hotels in the oases with their pistachio nut shrubs and roses and have never met such friendly people. I finished off the trip with a few days amid the empty beaches, mangroves, salt caves and gorges of Qeshm Island in the Strait of Hormuz. The cost of the trip, through Tehran-based Adventure Iran, was £495pp for six days, food, guide and transfers. I am going back soon, further south, to visit the Lut desert, which has a claim to be the hottest place on Earth, having recorded over 70C. Bernard PhelanLast summer, with my husband, I went on a road trip in the States. We had hoped to do lots of hiking, but we arrived in the middle of a 35C heatwave, so we changed our plans. We contacted Regis Canoe Outfitters, on the Saranac River (New York state), and spent the next three days canoeing around lakes and creeks, interspersed with lengthy dips to cool ourselves down. At night, we listened to the croaking of frogs from one of the many free wild camping spots. The camping sites are free, but designated, and are generally first come, first served. If you get lucky, you can have your own private island for the night, at zero cost. True bliss and so much better than hiking in the stifling heat.• Canoe hire for three days $52, canoeoutfittersBreeLast November, I ran the Extreme West Atlantic Trail race in Flores island in the Azores. The route, on a hard hiking trail, stretches 36km through mountainous terrain. The morning mist lifting in the volcanic crater lakes, the spectacular waterfalls, the dense forest and the old brick walkways and dry-stone walls gave the sense of a place lost in time. I stayed on the west coast of the island (the most western point in Europe), in Casas da Cascata (doubles from €70), a beautiful stone house under a waterfall. Sara Cycling the Four Rivers route from Seoul to Busan is a glorious trip along 600km of generally flat cycle path and quiet country roads covering the length of the country. Accommodation is cheap and plentiful with options from camping to hotels. We found local people to be extremely welcoming, even if you can’t speak Korean. Food was cheap and plentiful and the mountainous scenery was stunning. Taken at your own pace it’s as painful or relaxing as you want it to be, and the best way to see this gem of a country. Summer mosquitos mean autumn and spring are the best times to make the trip, excellent for foliage and wild flowers, too.BenI took a six-night swim trip with Strel in warm turquoise waters taking in the Gulf of Kotor, the stunning Plava Spilja (Blue Grotto) and in Yugoslavian submarine tunnels.

Although Attenborough has worked for other broadcasters before, such as Sky, the financial clout and global reach of Netflix and its move into traditional BBC territory sparked fears last year that he might make the streaming service his main home.However, he has a long association with the BBC ning 60 years, including a spell as BBC2 controller.Fortunately for viewers, there will be no clash between the similar-sounding Our Planet and One Planet, Seven Worlds. The Netflix show is due to be released in April, while its BBC rival is expected to air in the autumn.Announcing the Protecting Our Planet season, Alison Kirkham, BBC’s controller of factual commissioning, pointed out: “Plenty of other broadcasters are now following our lead, but we’re determined to keep moving the conversation forwards.“That’s what makes the BBC special: the desire to anticipate and stimulate the national conversation, not motivated by commercial imperatives or what’s in fashion. The BBC has a unique commitment to factual programming. I don’t believe any other broadcaster in British television has such an extraordinary breadth of output in factual.”Other shows announced by Kirkham ranged from Nadiya on Anxiety, a documentary from Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain revealing how she suffers from and copes with anxiety, and My Family, the Holocaust and Me, fronted by Robert “Judge” Rinder.In addition, Louis Theroux investigates sexual assault in US colleges, and a groundbreaking documentary executive produced by the  tells the story of a gay transsexual man’s quest to have a child in Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave Birth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccfa48ce98a2de32bdeacbb281d524739ee7a33/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0b439e11e28257826f950458f724186d 1320w","title":"europe sets up scheme to get round us sanctions on iran","story":"Vehicle to be used for humanitarian supplies, then expanded to help firms tradeFrance, Germany and Britain have set up a financial mechanism designed to avoid US sanctions against Iran and keep the 2015 nuclear deal afloat.Through the Instex trade vehicle, they hope to assert European economic sovereignty in the face of Washington’s determination to impose its foreign policy on Europe.The strategy would initially focus on trying to ease the flow of humanitarian supplies to Iran, the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said. Such supplies, including medicines and foodstuffs, are not supposed to be subject to US sanctions.Eventually, the plan is for the vehicle to expand to allow European firms to trade more freely with Iran in a range of goods, including those subject to US sanctions, the EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, said.Instex, which stands for “instrument for support of trade exchanges”, was registered this week, and will act as a proposed payment channel from Europe to Iran, and vice versa. It will not be fully operational until later this year. Iran will be expected to establish a parallel organisation. If the scheme works, it is likely to be most useful to small- and medium-sized firms with no links in the US.The body is being designed and run by Britain, France and Germany but will receive the endorsement of the entire EU on Thursday. Further details are expected to be unveiled at a meeting of European foreign and defence ministers in Bucharest.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said: “The entity will facilitate legitimate trade under European and international law. Its immediate focus will be on enabling trade in goods where the immediate need of the Iranian people is greatest, ie foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods.”Hunt said the nuclear deal was “crucial for the security of the region”, but stressed the initiative did not in any way absolve Iran from needing to end its other hostile and destabilising activities. The EU refused to follow Donald Trump last year in pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Washington says that, although Iran has met the terms, the accord was too generous, failing to rein in Iran’s ballistic missile programme or curb its regional meddling.Ever since, European firms have been faced with ever more assertive, and broadly effective US treasury measures to scare them off trading with Iran. Many multinationals have pulled investments from Iran, plunging an already struggling Iranian economy into further difficulty.Tehran has been pressing for progress on the payment channel for months, occasionally threatening to pull out of the deal unless the EU showed greater urgency on what is a highly technical banking and legal exercise.A key question is whether the US will see Instex, as initially constructed, as a legitimate target for sanctions by the US treasury, since it has warned any European entity trading with Iran with US connections or using dollars can be subject to punitive fines.Instex’s initial purpose of easing the flow of supplies such as food and medicines to Iran might protect the body since the US sanctions net is not meant to extend to humanitarian supplies.In 2017, the export of drugs from Europe to Iran was worth $884m compared with $194m from China and $52m from India, according to UN data.Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, the founder of a Europe-Iran business forum said the mechanism, even if limited, could eventually pave the way for something more ambitious.“It could turn into a pilot that the US would find difficult to target with political legitimacy given its humanitarian focus,” he said.The US embassy in Berlin said Washington did not expect the payment system to reduce economic pressure on Iran. An embassy spokesperson repeated Trump’s threat that all who continued to do business with Iran would be subject to US sanctions.A high-level European diplomatic representation on the Instex supervisory board may act as a firewall preventing the Trump administration from imposing sanctions.Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the success of the vehicle would depend on expert meetings that Iran would subsequently have with the Europeans, including between central banks.With the UK planning to leave the EU, London is less motivated than French and German politicians to see the vehicle as the start of a wider drive to establish a euro-based rival for the dollar. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has repeatedly called for greater European autonomy, and the EU is studying plans to challenge dollar dominance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

In a statement the parliament urged the bloc’s 28 governments to follow suit and declare Guaidó “the only legitimate interim president” until there were “new free, transparent and credible presidential elections”.“Parliament has spoken. For us, Mr Guaidó is the president of Venezuela and we do hope that the European Union will find a united position on this,” Jeremy Hunt, the UK foreign secretary, told reporters on arrival at a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers in Bucharest. The EU has imposed an arms embargo and sanctions on Venezuelan officials, but Hunt wants the bloc to impose further targeted sanctions.On Thursday, the Spanish news agency EFE said three of its journalists – a Spanish reporter, a Colombian photographer and a Colombian TV producer – who had been detained on Wednesday were being released and deported. Two detained French journalists working for television channel TMC were also released on Thursday.“We firmly believe that all journalists should be able to exercise their duties and responsibilities and rights in the exercise of their work,” said Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief, in Bucharest.Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s Americas director, said: “The detention of journalists is a flagrant and deeply concerning attack on freedom of expression and the right to truth … A free press is fundamental for the defence of human rights in any country in the world.”Speaking on BBC radio, Hunt said a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding in the country, with citizens struggling to find scraps of food. “We are not considering sanctions against the whole country because there is a humanitarian situation and we wouldn’t want to make the situation even worse,” he said. “But targeted sanctions against the kleptocrats who have enriched themselves on the back of the rest of the population who are very poor, that is something I think can be effective.”Key EU countries are prepared to recognise Guaidó as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela if Maduro refuses to call fresh elections by Sunday. But not every EU state has issued the ultimatum, and Russia is looking to see if these isions can be prised open. Moscow has so far offered full-throated support for Maduro. It is estimated to have invested £13bn in Venezuela through refinancing of the country’s debt and through oil and arms deals.Members of Maduro’s administration have rejected and ridiculed the EU countries’ ultimatum, the end of which will be marked by a day of pro-opposition protests on Saturday.“These men from the EU who think Venezuela is a colony have given us eight days to call elections and the deadline runs out on Saturday,” the powerful socialist party leader Diosdado Cabello told a rally in the northern city of Coro on Wednesday.“How scary. How terribly scary!” Cabello added mockingly. “Is the US going to get involved in an attack against Venezuela?”Maduro has accused Donald Trump and a “group of extremists around him” of plotting to topple him in order to seize Venezuela’s oil, and said he risked transforming the country into a new Vietnam.Venezuela’s supreme court has imposed a travel ban and financial restrictions on Guaidó, including freezing his bank accounts.Guaidó, 35, a former student leader and head of Venezuela’s opposition-run national assembly, has been at the forefront of a renewed attempt to force Maduro from power.He said in an opinion piece for the New York Times on Wednesday that he had held “clandestine” meetings with the military to try to persuade them to withdraw their support for Maduro. Protesters marched in Caracas on Wednesday calling for Maduro to stand down.In an interview to Spain’s El País newspaper, Guaidó repeated an appeal to Venezuela’s armed forces to take his side. “I am convinced that at a certain moment ... the army will end up manifesting its discontent, and take this opportunity to stand on the side of the constitution. And not only because we propose an amnesty,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb9e34fb343adf4b0153176ecc951ed3faf913e/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e415c131b167cbf3ecca3e8a4168d5c9","title":"how do trees survive in winter","story":"Some shed their leaves others rely on antifreeze in their veins (or pine needles) to survive the colder months. But trees couldn’t survive winter without the special relationship they have with birdsAside from the music of the westerlies playing through those skeletal canopies, British woods, when stripped of their leaves, tend to have an atmosphere of expectant quietude. Winter is a time of frugality, and the two major tree types, deciduous and evergreen, adopt very different strategies to cope with the double challenge of little sunlight and low temperatures.A deciduous tree operates by shedding all its leaves. This means that it lacks the means to photosynthesise and, thus, to generate fresh energy for five to six months of the year. However, there’s an upside to losing foliage, because it has ended the loss of moisture that occurs through leaves.This endless recycling of water from the trees to the atmosphere, known as transpiration, is costly. A single large mature oak may possess up to 200,000 leaves, and lose as much as 150,000 litres of water over the course of a year. A summer wood in full foliage conceals thousands of rising columns of tree-borne moisture, which is why it often feels so warm and humid within woods, when the surrounding countryside can be cool and breezy.Conifer trees reduce the stress of water loss by possessing fine needle-like leaves with minimum surface area and thick, waxy water-retaining cuticles. The adaptations slow down the process of transpiration. While the structure of evergreen foliage doesn’t have the energy-producing efficiency of a flat plate-like deciduous leaf, the fact that conifers can continue to photosynthesise year-round compensates for this. Some pines even have antifreeze in their needles, to enable them to work in icy conditions.The dormancy of winter trees means that this is the best time for planting or transferring them around our gardens. Choose a warm winter’s day so the earth is soft, dig a hole deep enough so the soil fully protects the roots from frost, then water well once planted. Observing how that new tree slowly grows and flourishes is one of the most satisfying processes in gardening.Trees also make use of the winter to do some self-propagation of their own. Much of the work for this process begins in the autumn, with the production of seeds and fruit. British oaks are a perfect example. From September onwards they leave a great larder of sugar- and protein-rich food for hungry birds or mammals, in the form of acorns. Squirrels, rodents and several species of crow store these nuts away to consume during the colder months. Yet, no species has more of a capacity to plan ahead than the creature that William Henry Hudson called the “British bird of paradise”: the European jay.In late autumn, this glorious pink-and-blue bird can be seen making repeat journeys to and from acorn-producing oak trees. The jay then buries them, sometimes flying several miles from the original source tree. Over the course of autumn, the average bird hides about 5,000 acorns. Across Britain and Ireland, the entire jay population stores somewhere in the region of 1.7bn acorns.The birds possess extraordinary memories for where they have hidden their stores, and yet – here is the clever part – they can’t remember them all. Not only do those forgotten acorns stand a strong chance of growing into oak saplings the following spring, but jays show a preference for open ground between tree cover in their choice of burial sites. In other words, they plant their acorns precisely where they might grow best.This acorn storage system thus benefits the jay twice over. Not only does it provide itself with food for the winter, but by forgetting some of its larder it also creates fresh habitat for future generations of jays. These birds are truly s of our oak woods. But it works both ways: by taking care of the birds, the trees ensure they prosper themselves.The dispersal of seed is, in fact, a major part of the woodland scene in winter. Hawthorn, holly, yew, mountain ash, crab apple, blackthorn and sea buckthorn – not to forget woodland shrubs, such as mistletoe and ivy, or garden favourites including cotoneaster and pyracantha – all produce fruit that birds love.Thrushes are especially drawn to these trees and consume vast quantities of their fruits. In return for this generosity, the thrushes then fly to their roosts in some hedge or tall tree at dusk and do what comes naturally. They poop out seeds during the night and leave each one in its own little store of fertiliser.So woods and birds are truly partners in reproduction. You can see how they interact on any winter’s day and in any wood, from John O’Groats to Land’s End, and from the mountain tops to the seashore.

Photograph: AFP photopoolCem OksuzGetty ImagesThe EU needs to be “more flexible”and “find pragmatic solutions”to UK concerns about a border between Northern Ireland and Britain, Switzerland’s former president Micheline Calmy-Rey has said.Speaking at a conference on Brexit in Dublin, the politician said that she understood how France might be unhappy with a border being imposed with Corsica or Spain with Catalonia.She urged flexibility from Brussels on the UK opposition to the Border issue under the terms of the Brexit deal, rejected by Westminster.The Swiss politician ruled out the border between Switzerland – neither a member of the EU nor the European Economic Area – and the EU as an option for the Northern Irish border because there were checks on some goods.The UK, post-Brexit, and Switzerland were in a similar situation, she said at a conference on the UK’s departure from the EU held at DCU’s Brexit Institute.Brexit has “a merit” in forcing the EU and other European countries “to clarify and perhaps choose” between two visions of institutional integration on the continent of Europe, she said.The EU could be more flexible and acknowledge ersity in Europe to break from the “binary model where you either in, a member of the European club, or you are out, not a member, and as such subject to pressure and discrimination,” she said.“We feel subject to discrimination and we are under pressure,” she said, noting that just 10 per cent of the Swiss people supported joining the EU.“It is not a war to be the biggest one,” she said.Switzerland’s ersity and “institutional architecture could serve as an inspiration” for the future of Europe and the EU, she said.The EU and Switzerland manage trade under 120 sector-by-sector agreements. Ms Calmy-Rey said negotiations to reach an “institutional” EU-Swiss trade deal had not found agreement after five years.Switzerland considered the potential for the European Court of Justice having “the last word” on whether the Swiss were implementing EU laws under a trade agreement as “unacceptable”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Oli ScarffGetty ImagesDuring the Spanish Civil War, sympathetic guides took volunteers wishing to fight for the republic over mountain passes from France, which only goats might have been expected to cross.Decades later, a heavily-militarised German Democratic Republic (the DDR or Communist East Germany) prevented its citizens from leaving by a 1,400 km long wall of concrete, barbed wire and guns stretching from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia.Even in today’s times of modern surveillance it is difficult fully to control the crossing of borders by those who are sufficiently motivated to attempt to do so, whether they are desperate refugees, smugglers and criminals, or fighters in some cause.The complex and sometimes bloody history of Ireland’s porous own borderlands has been documented more than once, most recently in writer and mapmaker Garrett Carr’s fascinating book The Rule of the Land.Carr traversed every kilometre of the contested territory, illustrating how notoriously difficult they are to seal and to police – a reality that was too visible for too long to Border communities.For two years, the movement of goods has dominated the Brexit negotiations. The movement of people, by contrast, appears on the face of it to be a far simpler matter, but this is not the whole story.Even if ways and means can be found to regulate the movement of goods, or if it proves possible to do away with the need for such controls, this will not be the case for the movement of people. The implications of this have not been fully considered.The 1921 Anglo Irish Treaty was silent on matters of migration and settlement, including cross-Border movement. By default, it was assumed that the new Free State would, for all practical purposes, continue to function in the same manner as before.Irish and British people continued to have reciprocal immigration and settlement rights in one another’s jurisdictions. It also meant that border controls were concerned primarily with goods and not people.The free movement regime between the two jurisdictions changed during the second World War. Travel from Ireland to Britain, usually for employment purposes, was subject to permission from both sides.Travel from the Free State to Northern Ireland required an identity document a residence permit was necessary if a longer stay was intended. Interestingly, Northern Ireland travellers faced control checks if they sought to enter Britain.In itself, this is an indication of how impracticable it was considered to seek a hard land border within the island, even though Northern Unionists resented being placed on a different footing from people in other parts of the UK.Such anger was frequently ventilated by Unionist MPs in the House of Commons. The British requirement for a travel permit for those coming from any part of the island of Ireland did not lapse until the end of 1947.The UK view was that travel controls would only be fully abolished if and when a similar immigration policy was established between the two governments. Such a policy was agreed by the Department of Justice in Dublin and the UK home office in London in 1952.It formed the basis for what is now known as the Common Travel Area (CTA), a term first used in 1953. Irish officials went to some lengths to conceal the background to the negotiation, telling London the rules would be “entirely informal”.Consequently, the terms of the 1952 agreement were not made public at the time - a deal that lay at the heart of UKIrish immigration arrangements for decades was effectively kept secret for decades, at Dublin’s behest.The CTA is an unusual arrangement, as may be judged by the Ireland Act passed by Westminster. Within this, “the Republic of Ireland is not a foreign country for the purposes of any law in force in any part of the United Kingdom”.British prime minster Theresa May has insisted it will remain in place after Brexit. So, too, has the Irish Government. Under it, Irish and British citizens have free movement rights, the right to work, settle, claim benefits, even vote.There was, nevertheless, an obvious downside. The CTA has meant that Dublin remained subservient to London in all key matters regarding immigration policy. Moreover, when the UK changed its policies, Ireland followed suit.Sometimes, the co-operation jarred notably Dublin’s willingness to follow the diktats of the home office’s ‘blackbook’. If a person on that list applied for a visa to enter Ireland, a refusal was automatic.The CTA was premised on the assumption that both countries showed, as it were, an identical face, and applied more or less identical policies, to the outside world and its citizens. Such a stance was unsavoury and unpalatable but arguably sustainable, where one of those countries was one with very limited immigration - the loss of autonomy it implied for Ireland was small.However, the immigrant population of Ireland today is 17 per cent, albeit mostly from the European Union. The entire question of humanitarian migration - asylum seekers and refugees - is more important today than it was for the Ireland of the 1950s.What if, for instance, the UK was to lurch further towards a xenophobically anti-immigrant stance, or even to contemplate a radical rejection of the terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention? Would Ireland’s hands be tied as well?For Ireland, the CTA has guaranteed ready access for generations of Irish emigrants to a nearby labour market with a shared language and a strong demand for Irish workers. From a UK point of view, such labour has been readily available and affordable.Often, the UK was a\u0026nbspsafety valve for Ireland’s social problems. It accepted Ireland’s pregnant, unmarried women those seeking abortions, the poor, or simply those who did not feel at home in an often intolerant State.The CTA has also constituted a key element in the management of a complex set of close relations and tensions between the two jurisdictions. It withstood even the most difficult and fractious period of the Troubles without substantial modification.The Belfast Agreement of 1998 spurred the dismantling of day-to-day barriers between the two parts of Ireland and between the two islands, including any requirement for the inspection of documents or other Border controls.Brexit will give rise to a situation where the freedom of movement enshrined in European Union policy and law will no longer apply in the UK, but the CTA will remain in force.Now, however, a question will arise as to the viability and adequacy of the CTA in the regulation of travel between the UK and Ireland when one of these remains in the EU and the other leaves.It now seems likely that post-Brexit Britain will move to restrict and regulate the movement of all third-party nationals into the UK, including those coming from the European Union - with the exception of Irish nationals.The changes will bring consequences. Regarding the movement of non-EU immigrants, we may expect to see strengthened co-operation between the Irish and British authorities to make the two jurisdictions a common jurisdiction in all but name.Citizens from other EU member states will have an unimpeded right of movement to Ireland, but no right of onward travel to the UK. The UK is now suggesting that national insurance checks, or other such inspections can prevent illegal immigration from Ireland.However, the creation of such a back-door seems logically and practically incompatible with the regulation of movements into Britain at ports, airports or by train. In all such cases, the UK has been insistent on the need for tight controls and reinforced borders.For instance, this is why the UK would not join the Schengen zone in the 1990s. It would be no exaggeration to say that “taking back control of our borders” was a key element in the Brexit platform.Why should it be different for IrelandUK movements and what might happen, say, to the putative 10,000 Spanish or Romanian migrants who might legally come to Ireland and proceed to attempt to cross the Border, if there are no border controls in place?Indeed, would the Irish authorities themselves be comfortable with potential flows in the other direction in an unstable post-Brexit situation? Electronic surveillance will not address these issues.The initial removal of Border controls in the 1990s was accompanied by a number of “soft control” measures to\u0026nbspensure that people not entitled to take advantage of the new freedoms did not seek to do so.This led to regular inspections on ferries between Scotland and Northern Ireland, for instance, in order to ascertain whether people who were not Irish or British might have crossed, or intended to cross the Irish border.It also led to Garda checks on buses and trains. Sometimes, ethnic profiling was used, as one black west Belfast man found out to his cost. Such checks now could see people carrying documents to prove that they had the right to circulate without carrying documents.More generally, it must give rise to the fear that the British and Irish authorities will in effect operate a shared zone of control between the two islands - one that might affect Ireland’s place in the European Union.For the UK authorities, the Common Travel Policy survived because Irish and UK immigration policies were strongly aligned. It is equally clear that neither the UK nor Ireland regard the notion of a “hard” land border as practicable or desirable.But jointly-imposed Anglo-Irish controls are very much on the horizon now after the UK leaves the European Union, involving cross-Border surveillance of asylum seekers, refugees and EU migrants - even if no hard border in the conventional sense returns.Piaras Mac Éinrí, is a lecturer in geography and European studies in the Department of Geography, University College Cork Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: DCUUK politicians must begin making “sensible, practical decisions” if they want the British people to continue eating certain foods after Brexit, one of Ireland’s biggest food producers and exporters said.Paul Wilson, vice-chairman of Monaghan Mushrooms, Europe’s biggest mushroom producer which supplies half of all mushrooms consumed in the UK, said Britain imports half of all food products.UK politicians will find a way to break the deadlock with the European Union over the deal to ensure a continued supply of food after Britain’s departure on March 29th, he said.“If they wish to continue to consume the product, they will simply have to find some kind of solution. That applies to much more than mushrooms,” Mr Wilson told a conference on Brexit and the agrifood sector.Agrifood producers at the conference at DCU’s Brexit Institute expressed alarm at the political turmoil in London and spoke about the contingency measures being taken to cope with the UK crashing out without a deal.“Common sense is often not that common,” Mr Wilson told The . “It is Westminster that’s the alarming bit, what is happening there and the sort of confusion and absolute lack of direction.”Ornua, owner of Kerrygold and the UK’s biggest-selling cheddar brand Pilgrims Choice, told the event it has stockpiled cheese in Britain to avoid Brexit-related delays at ports from March until maybe June. Chief executive John Jordan said the UK may impose zero tariffs on food products post-Brexit to maintain the country’s low-price food because of the fears about food inflation and the impact on demand. “It is hard to see British politicians signing up to something that would mean there would be very significant food inflation,” he said.He that zero tariffs would increase competition for Irish producers from countries such as New Zealand. Monaghan Mushrooms plans to ship 120,000kg of mushrooms grown every week in Northern Ireland to Britain in the event of a hard Brexit, though Mr Wilson warned that this would not meet the firm’s existing UK supply which comes from Irish, British and Dutch farms. “If there is a hard break with no planning, then the disruption is going to be very difficult to control,” he said.The UK is a key export market for Monaghan Mushrooms, accounting for 60 per cent of its revenues. Some 90 per cent of Irish mushrooms are exported to the UK. Mushrooms are grown to order and, with an eight-day shelf life, cannot be stockpiled. They appear on shelves within 36 hours of being harvested. Mr Wilson said he convinced big UK customers to accept sterling devaluations in customer deals in the year after the Brexit vote by warning: “You won’t have any mushrooms next week unless we start talking about currencies.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

This is a practice where a member state informs other EU countries of its legislative changes and checks whether it complies with overall EU provisions.The legislation is a private member’s Bill sponsored by Fine Gael TD Noel Rock and Fianna Fáil TD Stephen Donnelly but supported by Government.Mr Rock said the Bill “effectively bans the sale of above cost tickets - that’s it”.Technology had allowed people to distort the market allowing the purchase of tickets by bots and their resale on secondary websites and real people were being “bullied off the pitch” by those whose sole interest was to make a profit.Fianna Fail TD Stephen Donnelly said tickets went on sale this week with a €70 face value for singer Ariana Grande but were now costing hundreds of euro on secondary sites.And “even the toughest parents can be worn down” by the pester power of crying children to pay vastly inflated prices online for tickets. It was time he said to “break free from these ticket touts”.Once the legislation is signed into law, he said, “everyone in Ireland will know that to offer a ticket above face value is illegal”.But Sinn Féin TD Maurice Quinlivan criticised the “glacial pace” of Government movement on the issue.Mr Quinlivan introduced similar legislation two years ago “but Fine Gael sought to delay it because it was from a Sinn Féin Deputy”.He also criticised the decision to increase the venue size for which the Bill would be applicable from 300 seats to 1,000. Mr Quinlivan said that would exclude dozens of theatres including the National Opera House in Wexford with over 800 seats, the Abbey and Tivoli Theatres in Dublin and the Lime Tree theatre in Limerick.Labour TD Jan O’Sullivan said one of the biggest problems was the use of bot technology. But she expressed concern for the 275 jobs in an IDA-backed company in her Limerick constituency that offers customer service for an online company offering a platform for the resale of tickets.Debate on the Bill continues."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.19 Lock your profile downIf you haven’t done this already, do it now. In Settings, hit the Privacy tab. From here, you can control who gets to see your future posts and friends list. Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu.Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who’s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever.

Finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms.Apple and Facebook have found themselves arguing over user privacy and the protection of personal data in recent months. Tim Cook criticised Facebook over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica crisis and suggested it was different because it chose not to make its customers its products – which Mark Zuckerberg said was extremely glib and did not represent how Facebook thinks about its customers.Despite those fallouts, Facebook and Apple rely heavily on each other. That arrangement is said to have led to problems in the past, with Apple unable to punish Facebook without threatening many of the biggest apps on its platform.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From today, these are changing significantly, in the biggest development since they were first introduced.\u0026nbspApple Stores have always had areas like the Genius Bar where you can take an Apple gadget that needs a new screen, for instance, and a dedicated set-up area means you’re given help with a new iPhone, say, before you leave the store.\u0026nbspBut it’s the live sessions which are changing, the ones which fall into the category called Today at Apple.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI visited the company’s remarkable Apple Park campus in Cupertino, to try the new events first hand and talk to Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s head of retail and Karl Heiselman, senior director of retail.Back in October, Ahrendts slightly stole the show at the company’s event to reveal the new MacBook Air and iPad Pro. Walking onstage to a roof-raising reception from the New York crowd, she talked about the importance of Apple Stores being more like community spaces, town squares as she called them.That’s why the stores are being redesigned with large video walls, avenues with real trees and inviting open spaces, so that people would want to come in without a purchase in mind.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightNow, the events have been updated to match this greater sense of inclusivity. Ahrendts said, “I always say that the stores are Apple’s biggest product. I think that the architecture of the stores, that’s our hardware and what we do inside is the software. This is an updated software release of the in-store experience. We have over 50 new sessions. Altogether there are 18,000 sessions a week worldwide.”She went on to say that when the Apple Stores were created by Steve Jobs, that the staff were not there to sell. “You know, Steve built Apple Retail. And he told the teams when he hired them that they\u0027re not allowed to sell. He said they have no commission, no quotas. He told them, ‘Your job is to enrich their lives and you have to do it through the lens of education.’ He also said that Apple is the crossroads between liberal arts and technology. Well, we were brilliant in the stores at technology. But how do we unlock that liberal arts piece?”“Being a creative all my life, it\u0027s kind of a dream job for me to help communities be more creative,” Karl Heiselman, a former CEO of brand consultants Wolff Olins, explained. Apple employs staffers in its stores called Creative Pros, who are as heavily trained as the people in the Genius Bars. “We have 3,400 Creative Pros organised by passion or theme –\u0026nbspso photography, music, art and design, coding and app development. They go deep on each one of those, and these people are amazing. Some of them are Emmy winners, celebrated artists and musicians.”Ahrendts added:\u0026nbsp“If you’re a photographer and that’s your passion, we’ll help make you a better photographer, we’ll demo a lens for you. That whole experience of what you do with your iPhone, we want to give you a rich physical experience as well.” The Creative Pros were key to developing the new sessions.Heiselman also made clear that these people are not there just to talk at you. “The thing that defines Today at Apple is it’s not just sharing your story, everyone gets a hands-on. That participatory piece is very important. Because we always say you don\u0027t want to create a session which is like something you can do on the Internet. So maybe an illustrator might share their story and their work and then we hand out iPads and say it’s your turn. We try to, as much as we can, have the audience give it a go.”So, give it a go I did, at previews of the new schedule.New Apple handset to feature three cameras for 3D imagesThe world’s tech giants are about the feel the pinchApple blocks Facebook from installing its internal apps on iPhonesThere are three kinds of sessions in Today at Apple: Skills, Walks and Labs – though the basic sessions introducing customers to Apple products and the ones aimed at explaining accessibility features will continue as before.Skills are the sessions which focus on a particular feature, such as the one I attended on GarageBand, Apple’s deceptively complex music creation app: it looks simple from the outside but is extensive and feature-rich.\u0026nbspI’ve used it but hadn’t been aware of the seemingly endless range of drums available in it. As with all Today at Apple events, you don’t need to bring your own Apple product, or even own one. They’re supplied when you get there, including – to the relief of the other customers in the Apple Store – Beats headphones to keep my attempts at music private. The purpose of the session was pretty specific, to create a beat using the beat sequencer.There are three sections to each event, inspiration, participation and celebration. This means introducing the topic in enough detail to get people wanting to try it and then let them loose on doing it. The final section involved participants sharing their newly created beats. Of course, sharing what you’ve done is voluntary.The Walks events begin inside an Apple Store and then move outdoors. Photography walks have been a staple of Today at Apple for a while, often showing locals parts of their towns they’ve never really seen before. I went to an Art Walk using the amazingly detailed digital illustration app, Procreate. Armed with an iPad Pro, we strolled the area around the store taking photos of colours that took our eye, from a pale green leaf to an eye-searingly bright yellow fire hydrant. These colours were incorporated into the app’s palette and from there we were encouraged to create our own art. My effort, which a psychiatrist might call a cry for help, is below.Walks are the most popular type of session, Heiselman said.And then there are the Labs. These are the most indepth of the events, lasting up to 90 minutes. I tried out \u0027Video Lab: Small Screen Magic, co-created with Zach King\u0027,\u0026nbspwhich concentrated on how to use a jump-cut technique in Apple’s short video app, Clips. The huge video wall was the focus here, where a specially recorded video introduction\u0026nbspfrom King, a YouTube star known for his “digital sleight of hand” was screened.This screen, by the way, has become so central to these stores that the staff jokingly refer to them as being powered by “Wall OS”. And it’s a magnet: once the session started, scores of people who happened to be in the store stopped to hover and watch.The participation section here was particularly fun and the Apple Store was momentarily taken over by the simulation of vanishing and reappearing chairs while attendees performed precipitous prat falls. When edited together, the final cut movies were shown on the wall.All these sessions are free, with materials provided and no selling involved, though the Creative Pros are knowledgeable about the company’s products as well, so can advise you if you’re interested.\u0026nbspAnd those Pros are pretty remarkable. Ahrendts said they’d been training for months, and it shows. They are professional, unflappable and relaxed performers, eager to share their knowledge and their passion.When Apple’s iPhone sales have dipped, as revealed in the latest figures, it’s interesting to see a company make a considerable investment in staffing sessions like this.\u0026nbspBut it’s a cool way to tempt people through its doors.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Is he right?UK tax revenues are expected to take a hit\u0026nbspas a result but\u0026nbspthe size of the\u0026nbspimpact is not yet known.

After months of speculation, Ben Affleck has officially stepped down from the role of Batman, having appeared\u0026nbspin both Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Justice League (2017).Although the two DC universe outings didn’t fare so well with critics, with Justice League turning out to be an all-out box office bomb, Affleck’s weary, cynical take on the Caped Crusader still had plenty of fans, meaning his successor won’t have such an easy time stepping into his shoes.As it stands, the character is set to return for Matt Reeves’s noir-tinged standalone The Batman, scheduled for release on 25 June, 2021.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialProducers now face a lengthy search to find DC’s new Bruce Wayne, with sources stating they’re on the lookout for a younger star – although how much younger is unclear. Affleck is 46, so it seems, at this point, anyone in the 20s and 30s is fair game.With that in mind, we’ve chosen seven actors that could fit the bill, and including that all-important trait of a powerful chin.Created with Sketch.7 actors who could star in the new Batman film Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The 32-year-old actor is so perfect for the role of the suave and brooding billionaire that he’s already had the honour of being cast as Batman. Unfortunately, that was back in 2008 when George Miller was set to direct Justice League: Mortal, where he would have been joined by the likes of Adam Brody’s The Flash, Common’s Green Lantern, and Megan Gale’s Wonder Woman. After development went south, the project was indefinitely shelved and the studio instead focused on Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy. This could be the opportunity to finally make some lost dreams come true. Isaac has already had one rather ill-fated venture in the world of comic books, when he was truly wasted under mountains of blue prosthetics as X-Men: Apocalypse’s chief villain. Batman is a far better fit for the star his role as Poe Dameron in the Star Wars franchise has proven he’s certainly got the charm and it could help loosen up the character a little, recapturing some of the more cavalier attitude that Michael Keaton brought to the role. Yet, his work in critically acclaimed indies like Inside Llewyn Davis and Annihilation proves he’s also got the presence to continue Affleck’s more jaded take. In short, he’s got the range. At 39 years old, Isaac might be too old for the character producers are currently envisioning, but he’s a big enough household name that Warner Bros might overlook it in this case. Sheridan seems like the most likely candidate if Warner Bros are truly after a fresh-faced take on Batman. At 22, he’s the youngest on this list, but has already made his mark on the Hollywood blockbuster, fronting last year’s epic Ready Player One and starring as Cyclops in the current X-Men series. While Fox hasn’t officially declared that this year’s Dark Phoenix will be the last of the current iteration of the X-Men, with Disney’s takeover of the studio currently looming, it’s doubtful that the franchise has much of a future as it is. This frees up Sheridan to take on a far bigger, heftier comic book character. Plus, his breakout role in 2012’s Mud proved he excels when it comes to delivering gritty drama, which likely fits the tone Reeves is after for his film. Although there’s an impulse to look towards A-list stars when it comes to casting a character as iconic as the Caped Crusader, what DC might actually benefit the most from is an actor who’s not quite a household name yet, but still has the credentials to bring the right level of gravitas to the part. An actor like Rhodes would be perfect in this case. The 28-year-old still technically something of an up-and-comer, but his role in Moonlight proved he has a formidable screen presence, while Bird Box and The Predator showed he’s equally at home in genre fare. Rhodes is also particularly good finding vulnerability in his characters, which could prove to be a great strength if Reeves is after a weightier take on Batman, more in the vein of 2017’s Logan. The Batman has been pitched as a noir-flavoured take on the character, which could mean that producers are after an actor with a little bit of an Old Hollywood flair to him. If that’s the case, Golding fits the bill perfectly. His roles in last year’s Crazy Rich Asians and A Simple Favour showed that he\u0027s not only one of the hottest rising stars of the moment, but also has charm to spare in a way that could play well for a smooth-talking detective spin on Bruce Wayne. The only unknown factor here is whether the 31-year-old actor, who’s British-Malaysian, could nail the American accent, which he’s yet to do on film. It’s hard to imagine that would be much of a hurdle for him, however, as he’s already proven himself as a major talent.  The actor might be a little hesitant about returning to the world of comic book movies, considering he’s already starred in both Kick-Ass (the less said about its much maligned sequel, the better) and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Yet, neither of those films really gave the actor an opportunity to test his mettle as a box office champ, so an appearance in The Batman could be just what’s needed to boost his star power to the next level. What the 28-year-old actor really has in his corner, however, is range. Between the likes of Godzilla, Anna Karenina, and Nocturnal Animals, he’s demonstrated a chameleon-like ability to morph into whatever the project demands. It’d be exciting to see what exactly he’d do with Batman, considering the character’s been interpreted in so many different ways in the past. Despite Affleck’s departure, it does seem likely that Warner Bros won’t be keen to take Batman in too radical of a new direction. It might confuse audiences if we’re suddenly delivered with a sillier George Clooney-type (nevermind the fact Batman \u0026amp Robin crashed and burned) or, say, even an Adam West-esque iteration. We’ve been with a gritty Batman for too long for him to suddenly get the Thor: Ragnarok treatment. In that light, if the studio wants a direct successor to Affleck, then they can’t go wrong with O’Connell. The 28-year-old is a go-to if you want a leading man with the right level of edge and grit to him, thanks to his roles the likes of ‘71 and Starred Up. He’s yet to be really tempted into the world of franchises, outside of a role in 300: Rise of an Empire, which means he also doesn’t have the baggage of already being associated with a particular character.

Part of the experience was the need to change from one money into another. Now both the thrill and the nuisance have vanished.\u0026nbspA single currency prevails over most of the continent west of the old Iron Curtain with the notable exception of Norway.For some unthinking\u0026nbsppro-Europeans this has been a triumph. For Professor Ashoka Mody, distinguished US economics professor, who has held very senior positions at the IMF, it has at least been a profound mistake. Exchange rate changes enable countries with very different economic structures, histories and habits to trade peacefully with each other.\u0026nbspIf exchange rates remain stuck for whatever reason, disaster may await.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialEurotragedy by Ashoka Mody, reviewHelmut Kohl, who died only in 2017, believed\u0026nbspa single European currency was God’s gift to mankind. He frequently promoted expansionary monetary and fiscal policies which he knew were not in Germany’s interests but which he thought would be his legacy for Europe and mankind.Mody’s study takes us in more detail than most readers would want to know about the events leading up to and following the launch of the euro at the beginning of 1999. Meeting followed meeting and conference followed conference. During most of this time I was mainly concerned with the parochial problems of the British economy.\u0026nbspBut I did go to a notorious conference in Bonn at which the German minister Franz-Josef Strauss announced a devaluation of the French franc, only to have this rescinded from Paris within a few hours.Mody argues convincingly that the French economy was held back by the struggle to create and maintain the euro. But its misfortunes fade into insignificance compared with the experiences of Greece, which only joined the euro at the beginning of 2001. Despite its glorious history, Greece was now a small misgoverned Balkan state and was made to pay heavily for its decision. By 2017, Greek GDP was down by 25 per cent since the EU bailouts began and unemployment remained stuck at 20 per cent. Since then the Greek tragedy has worsened rather than improved.What lessons can we draw from two decades of the euro?What is the moral for the British reader? A tribute is in order for those who kept Britain out of the euro. The pound was devalued in 1947 and after a bitter internal wrangle in 1967.\u0026nbspBy the time the next run on the pound developed in the early 1980s the attempt to fix an official rate was abandoned and the British currency was mercifully allowed to float. There was a final attempt to fix a rate for the pound in the crisis of the early 1980s but since then market forces have partially prevailed and there has been no official rate for sterling, despite various attempts first to “shadow the D-mark” and later the euro.There are still many unanswered questions in the whole debate.\u0026nbspAs the late Canadian economist Harry Johnson once remarked, the discussion assumes that “a country is a country is a country”. It is not obvious why the French town of Strasbourg should be more clearly bound\u0026nbspto Paris than to Kehl on the other side of the Rhine.Meanwhile let us be thankful for small mercies and the lack of courage of successive British governments in not going the whole hog after the euro. It is far too early to provide the credits for this narrow escape. But we shall know soon enough – probably well before the 30-year rule allows the relevant documents to be published.Sir Samuel Brittan is a former economics editor of the Financial TimesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This follows a subdued December, when price growth slowed to 0.5 per cent.“Indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but forward-looking indicators had suggested some softening was likely.Brexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023The big Brexit forecast: what will happen to house prices in 2019?UK house prices growing at slowest pace in five years“In particular, measures of consumer confidence weakened in December and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer inquiries towards the end of 2018.“While the number of properties coming on to the market also slowed, this doesn’t appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months.”Mr Gardner said the uncertain economy is likely to be acting as a drag on the housing market, despite strong\u0026nbspemployment figures,\u0026nbspwage growth and low interest rates.He continued: “Near-term prospects will be heavily dependent on how quickly this uncertainty lifts, but ultimately the outlook for the housing market and house prices will be determined by the performance of the wider economy – especially the labour market.Howard Archer, of the EY Item Club said: “If Brexit is delayed, ongoing uncertainty is likely to weigh down on the housing market and could well see house prices stagnate or fall slightly.”Samuel Tombs,\u0026nbsp chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The uncertainty created by Brexit largely is responsible for the further decline in year-over-year growth in house prices to near-zero, from a broadly stable rate of about 2 per cent\u0026nbspin the 18 months before November.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is no compromise where the welfare of pupils is concerned.”They added: “Whilst we celebrate the good outcome for Steiner Academy Hereford, we are disappointed that six schools have been judged as inadequate and have taken immediate action to ensure that standards rapidly improve as per Ms Spielman’s recommendations.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy,” Mr MacKey told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“With the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”In response to such privacy concerns, Facebook said in a statement: “We’re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Pandora, small by moon standards (50 miles or 81 kilometers across) is elongated and irregular in shape. Mimas (246 miles or 396 kilometers across), a medium-sized moon, formed into a sphere due to self-gravity imposed by its higher massAn X1.6 class solar flare flashes in the middle of the sun in this image taken 10 September, captured by NASA\u0027s Solar Dynamics ObservatoryAn image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013A false colour image of Cassiopeia A comprised with data from the Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes and the Chandra X-Ray observatoryAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory.

On this mission, Kathryn Sullivan became the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk and Marc Garneau became the first Canadian in space. The crew of seven was the largest to fly on a spacecraft at that time, and STS-41G was the first flight to include two female astronauts1730 A Fresh Perspective on an Extraordinary Cluster of GalaxiesGalaxy clusters are often described by superlatives. After all, they are huge conglomerations of galaxies, hot gas, and dark matter and represent the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravityNasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope has unveiled in stunning detail a small section of the Veil Nebula - expanding remains of a massive star that exploded about 8,000 years agoThe arrangement of the spiral arms in the galaxy Messier 63, seen here in an image from the Nasa Hubble Space Telescope, recall the pattern at the center of a sunflowerThe spectacular cosmic pairing of the star Hen 2-427 — more commonly known as WR 124 — and the nebula M1-67 which surrounds itFour images from New Horizons’ Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with colour data from the Ralph instrument to create this enhanced colour global view of Pluto2230 Fresh Crater Near Sirenum Fossae Region of MarsThe HiRISE camera aboard Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter acquired this closeup image of a fresh (on a geological scale, though quite old on a human scale) impact crater in the Sirenum Fossae region of Mars.

That meant the scientists could take all of those different pieces of data – related to 700 different places in all – and combine them to understand the gravity on the surface.As the rover started to climb up a hill on the surface, the amount of gravity went up. But it did not go up as much as expected.The lower levels of Mount Sharp are surprisingly porous, says lead author Kevin Lewis of Johns Hopkins University. We know the bottom layers of the mountain were buried over time. That compacts them, making them denser. But this finding suggests they weren\u0027t buried by as much material as we thought.Scientists could use the findings to help understand where places like Mount Sharp came from, and how the Martian surface developed.There are still many questions about how Mount Sharp developed, but this paper adds an important piece to the puzzle, said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity\u0027s project scientist at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the mission. I\u0027m thrilled that creative scientists and engineers are still finding innovative ways to make new scientific discoveries with the rover.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That will help Apple\u0027s push into augmented reality, which has seen it release a range of tools to allow people to overlay virtual objects onto the real world.iPhone price to be reduced in many countries, Apple saysThe extra sensing capabilities could also improve traditional photos, allowing for images that capture better depth, according to the Bloomberg report.The technologies could be a trial run for Apple\u0027s plans for an augmented reality headset or glasses, which it has been repeatedly rumoured to be working on\u0026nbsp– and which the company has not explicitly denied.Apple\u0027s 2019 phone will also have a range of improvements to its camera technologies, according to the same report. They will include three cameras to allow for improved photo capabilities, which could allow for the phone to take a larger field of view, better zoom, and potentially allowing the phone to automatically improve photos or videos after they are taken.The 3D cameras were being worked on for this year\u0027s phones but were not ready in time, the Bloomberg report claimed. Instead, they will come to next year\u0027s line on the the 2020 version of the\u0026nbspiPhone XS Max, though they might not make it onto the upgraded versions of the XS and XR.As well as new camera technologies, Apple plans to improve the software used to take photos. That will include changes to the Live Photos feature – which captures video either side of a photo to allow people to see them in context – so that they take six seconds of video rather than three.The new phones will also have improved chips and an updated Face ID sensor so the phones unlock more quickly. Otherwise, they are expected to look largely similae to this year\u0027s models, with more dramatic changes coming in 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city.

A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father.

However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son.

His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.“We had the best intentions for\u0026nbspSerenity.\u0026nbspWe were excited for the opportunity to release this uniquely original movie and work with such a stellar cast and talented filmmakers.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart.

But does one exist? Ben Chu looks at the evidenceClick to followThe IndependentIs the prime minister looking for something that isn’t actually there?Theresa May is returning to Brussels to try to renegotiate the European Union withdrawal agreement to make it acceptable to a majority of MPs in the House of Commons.But what will she ask for?On Tuesday night almost all of her party’s MPs and\u0026nbspa majority of the Commons voted in favour of an amendment put forward by the senior Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady calling for the Irish backstop (the insurance clause that says the entire UK will remain in an EU customs union if there is no EU free trade deal struck that manages to avoid a hard border in Ireland) in the withdrawal agreement to be replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialDowning Street’s logic is that, if the EU agrees\u0026nbspto this, the agreement she brings back will finally make it through the Commons.But what might these alternative arrangements be? Even if the EU was prepared to reopen the withdrawal agreement, do they really exist?How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?The “Malthouse Compromise”, a proposal put together by Tory MPs from both wings of the party, refers to a “protocol” to replace the backstop in a document put out last month called “A better deal”. This was written by Shanker Singham of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank with opaque funding.This protocol offers various technological and procedural measures – including, among other things, customs checks away from the border and a new regime of regulatory equivalence between the UK and EU – which would supposedly eliminate any new frictions on the Irish border as a result of the UK leaving the EU customs union and single market.But how credible is it?Dr Katy Hayward of Queen’s University Belfast says its provisions for policing standards and preventing smuggling would not be secure.Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform agrees that the document is not\u0026nbspcredible in terms of policing.“Can you do it without physical infrastructure? Maybe. Can you do it without a significant uptick in ‘associated checks’? I don’t think so. Would it still constitute a border in many peoples’ minds and be disruptive? I think yes,” he says.In other words, if the Singham\u0026nbspplan is the only alternative to the Irish backstop that Theresa May can offer to Brussels her renegotiation effort looks likely to be short and unsuccessful.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

This follows a subdued December, when price growth slowed to 0.5 per cent.“Indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but forward-looking indicators had suggested some softening was likely.Brexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023The big Brexit forecast: what will happen to house prices in 2019?UK house prices growing at slowest pace in five years“In particular, measures of consumer confidence weakened in December and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer inquiries towards the end of 2018.“While the number of properties coming on to the market also slowed, this doesn’t appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months.”Mr Gardner said the uncertain economy is likely to be acting as a drag on the housing market, despite strong\u0026nbspemployment figures,\u0026nbspwage growth and low interest rates.He continued: “Near-term prospects will be heavily dependent on how quickly this uncertainty lifts, but ultimately the outlook for the housing market and house prices will be determined by the performance of the wider economy – especially the labour market.Howard Archer, of the EY Item Club said: “If Brexit is delayed, ongoing uncertainty is likely to weigh down on the housing market and could well see house prices stagnate or fall slightly.”Samuel Tombs,\u0026nbsp chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The uncertainty created by Brexit largely is responsible for the further decline in year-over-year growth in house prices to near-zero, from a broadly stable rate of about 2 per cent\u0026nbspin the 18 months before November.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are useless. Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series.

But she also says Britain will not leave the EU without a deal.And her deal — the only one on the table at this late stage — was defeated in the House of Commons by a record majority just two weeks ago.Tonight’s Brexit votes are not quite the final shoot-out between the dferent factions in Parliament. The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some EU figures have admitted it isn’t. They could tweak the text, time-limit the backstop or find another solution.They choose not to. And they will stick to that as long as they believe Parliament’s Remainers will ultimately strip the Government of its only negotiating leverage, the threat to just walk away.Remainers, some in Cabinet, may well yet do that. Nonetheless last night should sow doubt in Brussels’ minds.The victorious Brady amendment demands a vital, legally binding change to the Irish backstop before the PM’s deal can pass, just as The Sun called for.

So I’m not bothered about no deal.Appearing as a special guest at the Tory Eurosceptic Bruges Group, Mr Stringer said: Often in discussing the European Union my colleagues use kindergarten language - they say theyre our friends, how could they not have our interests at heart .I think it misunderstands that actually the bureaucrats in Brussels are a self-interested group of people - self-interested in their own survival and perpetuating their growing power and influence across the whole of the European continent.“It also misunderstands the fact that the European Union do negotiate but they usually come to agreements at the last minute – the th hour.“And that is possible which is why it’s important to send the Prime Minister back to Brussels over the next fortnight because I think that the European Union – one can’t be certain – actually want to come to a deal.”In an ominous warning for his party he predicted Labour would lose a lot of seatsit continued to frustrate Brexit.And there would be electoral peril for the partyLabour officially backed a second referendum, the MP added.Mr Corbyn is under pressure to sack a number of Labour frontbenchers who defied his order to back the bid to delay Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tp-graphic-backstop.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu backstop brexit nonsense","story":"Will Eurocrats cause needless ­disruption just to make a point  Would they rather see all sides suffer than watch a post-EU Britain succeed If so, what would it say about the ­organisation we are leaving Let’s take a moment to recap.Immediately after the referendum, EU officials declared they would not talk to Britain about a long-term relationship until we first agreed withdrawal terms, including a “orce payment”, rights for EU citizens and the Irish border.Britain foolishly agreed. It was ­particularly silly to discuss Ireland before the main trade talks, since the obvious way to prevent a hard border on the island is through a deep and ­comprehensive trade agreement between the UK and the EU as a whole.That, though, would have given Ireland a strong incentive to get the best possible terms for the UK, and for itself.So instead, at the end of , the EU suddenly came up with the idea of an “Irish backstop”.It wanted Britain to promise that, unless it came up with a long-term ­trading ­relationship that satisfied ­Brussels, it would stay in the customs union and leave Northern Ireland under EU regulations.Stupidly, British negotiators accepted the backstop. Wisely, our MPs did not.The backstop would mean Brussels continued to control Britain’s trade deals with non-European countries after we left.It would mean placing part of our country under permanent EU jurisdiction.MPs threw the deal out. Then something sensible happened.Leavers and Remainers began to talk directly to each other and hammered out a deal that both sides could live with.There were lots of aspects of the ­withdrawal agreement that Eurosceptics resented.They didn’t like being non- voting members for another  months.They didn’t like Euro judges continuing to rule here even after we had left.They didn’t like forking out more than billion quid in exchange for the better part of bugger all.But they were ready to make ­compromises. If the Irish ­backstop were removed, they’d swallow the rest of the withdrawal terms.On Tuesday, the House of Commons adopted this position. The EU responded with a theatrical snort of indignation.“We stand by the agreement that we have negotiated,” said Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s negotiator.“The withdrawal agreement is not ­renegotiable,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.But hang on. Juncker is simultaneously telling us thatwe alter our red lines — by, for example, agreeing to a ­permanent customs union — then the agreement could indeed be reopened.So there is plainly no technical or legal reason why the backstop could not be removed or at least time-limited.Nor, by the way, is anyone still ­pretending that, without the backstop, there will be checkpoints in Londonderry and Crossmaglen.The Irish government has confirmed that,there is no deal, it will not place any infrastructure at the border.The British Government has been saying the same all along.Barnier says there would be ways to carry out necessary checks away from the frontier.In other words, the whole row is about a border that no one is going to build anyway.It’s ­surreal. There is plainly no way the House of Commons is going to accept the backstop.It also became clear on ­Tuesday there is no majority for a ­second ­referendum, because the last thing Jeremy Corbyn wants is to have to come down on one side or the other.That leaves only two options. Either the backstop is dropped but everything  is agreed, or the backstop is lost and so is everything .From the EU’s point of view, it must surely be preferable to agree the bulk of the Withdrawal Agreement, including reciprocal citizens’ rights and the ­£billion payment, while finding an alternative way to guarantee the Irish border stays open.From Dublin’s point of view, the logic is even stronger.Insisting on the backstop risks,not a hard border, certainly more dislocation between the Republic of Ireland and the UK — the very thing the backstop is ­supposed to prevent.The EU has calculated the cost will be worse for Britain than for ­Continental states, since cross-Channel trade is ­proportionately more important for us.But, by that measure, it is more ­important still for Ireland.In private, some Continental politicians are pushing for a pragmatic outcome — one that minimises disruption and ­preserves the long-term alliance between the UK and its neighbours.You especially hear these arguments in countries that trade heavily with Britain, such as Denmark and the Netherlands.You also hear them from governments that want to ensure the rights of their citizens in Britain are guaranteed.But for Eurocrats, in particular the anti-British Martin Selmayr who has seized control of negotiations, this isn’t about finding an outcome that works.If it were, the EU could have signed a continuity deal with Britain easily.The truth is many Euro-fanatics are happy to inflict pain on the EU  ­provided they inflict even more on us.If their view prevails over that of the pragmatists, then Britain has no option but to leave without an agreement. It is never sensible to give into blackmail.If the choice is between No Deal and surrendering part of our country, we will choose No Deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All the while that £billion is being spent on fabulously berserk ­projects in the developing world.To her total credit, Mordaunt has said that our current level of spending on overseas aid is unsustainable. It’s been rising every year. Due to a law passed by the coalition government, we have to spend . per cent of our income on aid to the Third World each year.So right now we spend just under £billion. And where does this money go  No less than  per cent of it is siphoned off to global outfits like that most useless of organisations, the United Nations.This is the body which sent out some dimbo Australian envoy to tick off our Government about economic policy. An organisation which elected Saudi Arabia on to its Women’s Rights Commission. An anti-Western and rabidly anti-Israeli convocation of leftie Third World thugs with chips on their shoulders.The world would be enormously improvedthe UN was shut down tomorrow. And the rest of it  Some of the stuff you wouldn’t believe. A total of £, went to a project investigating Tibetan verbs. Nope, not kidding.I would assume that “climb” was one of the verbs they were investigating. They use that a lot, over there. Thanks to our overseas aid, someone, ­somewhere is now able to say in Tibetan: “F*** me, is that a yeti  Run away!”Then there’s the £, spent on a scheme to stop Indian schoolchildren imbibing sugary drinks. India itself gives overseas aid and has an income rather bigger than our own. Where is the point Another six-figure sum was spent ­persuading Chinese people not to smoke too much — China! The second richest country in the world.Another one was to help Indian workers cool their work­stations down — this in a country which has its own space programme, for Chrissakes. So much of our money is swallowed up by useless leftie quangos and charities to keep themselves in jobs.Still more is pocketed by despots in the horrible countries they run. It is a source of corruption and dependency. It makes things worse.

That’s why I agreed with the last secretary of state, Priti Patel, who wanted to give a decent chunk to the Israel Defence Forces, which saves a lot of lives in Syria.So my recommendation would be to end it all NOW.

He says he is simply challenging the “myth” of Churchill. No, Ross, you’re not.You’re just pig ignorant, with a very poor grasp of history. Of course Churchill was racist. Just about everybody was of his age at that time.If you can’t see the importance of Churchill to winning the Second World War – against REAL racists, REAL mass murderers – when Britain stood alone, then you lack all sense of context and proportion.The more I think about it, the more I reckon “ginger turd” was an understatement.HERO of the week is the excellent Rachel Riley, who has been speaking out against anti-Semitism. As a consequence, she now needs greater security when she’s doing TV’s ­Countdown. The left-wing Jew-hating trolls have been after her.Rachel,  said: “The more I speak, the more abuse I get, and the more abuse I get, the more I speak. It’s got to the point where I can’t look at my Twitter feed any more. It’s just a constant stream.”She’s pretty clear who is behind it, too.  A lot of the abuse comes from people who sign off with the hashtag JCPM.SO, Labour MP Fiona Onasanya is off to prison. Found guilty in court of lying through her teeth.But the remarkable thing is she’s still going to be paid as an MP while she’s inside. She has refused to resign her seat and so her £, salary will continue to be paid by the rest of us.If you got sent to the nick, do you think your employers would continue to pay your wages  You’d be out on your ear. It’s kind of ­outrageous, no THIS cultural appropriation business is getting out of hand. Marks  Spencer has been slammed by leftie nutters with nothing better to do with their time. For selling a biryani wrap.They say it’s not authentic. Well of course it’s not bleedin’ authentic.  This is the UK, not Mumbai. Singer Katy Perry was attacked for wearing a kimono because she isn’t Japanese.White people in the US get criticised for wearing training shoes or sporting afros – that’s appropriating black culture, apparently. Though I think it was white folks who invented training shoes. Thing is, cultural appropriation is brilliant.It’s the way we have of sharing our respective cultures.  think it’s wonderful that countries outside Europe and the US have “culturally appropriated” democracy, sanitisation, railways, computers and so on. I wish more would do the same.SOMALIA is the most corrupt country in the world, according to a list compiled by a group called Transparency International.Not a great surprise, is it  Nor to see most of the rest of Africa hogging the bottom quarter of the world table.It’s bad governance and corruption that is keeping Africa poor – not colonialism. You can tell that the compilers of the report are lefties, though. Asked what countries were becoming more corrupt recently, they named the US, Hungary and Brazil. All three have elected right-wing governments.A NEW study says that women who wear short skirts are more likely to be ­promoted.The lesson I’d take from this,I were a women, is to wear a short skirt to work. But I don’t think that’s the lesson they mean us to take.I wonderwomen who wear short skirts but have the legs of an obese ­elephant also are more likely to get ­promoted I think that’s the next study for those researchers at the ­University of Surrey.I TOLD you last week that the reason we haven’t had a proper winter yet is that the people who run winter couldn’t agree on stuff.Such as whether it should be a hard winter, with lots of snow, no winter at all or a compromise deal with a backstop of some sleet for a bit.But I understand that on Tuesday the President of ­Winter won an astonishing ­victory and was able to push her deal through.Which was why it immediately snowed like hell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and that the gender would be a surprise.Two days later, Meghan was cuddling dogs at the animal charity Mayhew - then joined Prince Harry that night at a Cirque du Soleil performance in a dazzling blue dress.And the announcement of the patronages earlier this month signalled Meghans close bond with the Queen, royal experts revealed.Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told The Sun Online the choices went “hand in glove” with the mum-to-be’s personality and history – and were the biggest nod of approval yet from the Queen after the monarch handed on two of her own patronages.The commentator said: “That is an undoubted sign of approval from Her Majesty.“It comes during a period when there have been so many rumours so it’s important to stress that this speaks very much to the Queen’s appreciation of her.”Speculation was last year re that Meghan had been involved in a row with her sister-in-law Kate Middleton, while sources claimed that she was dficult to work with.It will be a busy year for Meghan, who is expecting her first child with Prince Harry in the Spring.The couple, who married in May last year, are also expecting to move to Frogmore Cottage ahead of their babys arrival.The Grade-II listed county retreat, set in four acres of rolling Oxfordshire hills, boasts four bedrooms with one converted to a dressing room."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000465659774.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"giant oarfish sighting japan tsunami panic earthquakes","story":"Giant Oarfish are known as the Messengers from the Sea God’s Palace and are said by some to appear on beaches ahead of submarine earthquakes.They say the massive serpent-like fish rise to the surface and beach themselves to escape being caught up in an underwater quake.However, that also ties in with the more scientic theory that the bottom-dwellers are susceptible to movements in fault lines and act out of character before a quake.The oarfish’s reputation as a creature of doom was further enhanced after  were washed up along Japan’s northern coastline in .Months later, a massive earthquake struck off northeast Japan, triggering a tsunami that killed nearly , people and destroyed the Fukushima nuclear plant.Now news of fresh sightings of stricken giants have sparked some to fear the worst.The Giant Oarfish  is the longest of the so-called bony fishes.The longest confirmed specimen was more than  feetin .However, a more commonis around . feet .It is a deep-sea fish found between  and , meters down in all major oceans.They feed on krill, small fish, and squid.They spawn late in year and oarfish larvae can be easily found at the surface.Other comments on social media sites echoed those concerns, with one post in the -Channel site claiming increased sightings were clearly “a warning”,  reports the SCMP.Its not the first time there have been suggested links between animal behaviour and earthquakes.In fact theres a long history of reports of pets, zoo animals and wildle acting very strangely in the days or minutes before a tremor is felt by humans.In February , a .-magnitude earthquake struck Haicheng, a city of  million people located in Chinas Liaoning province.But one day earlier, city officials ordered an evacuation based in part on reports of strange animal behaviour.Hibernating snakes in the area, for example, abandoned their winter hideouts months before normal. The early evacuation of Haicheng is credited with saving thousands of human lives“The link to reports of seismic activity goes back many, many years, but there is no scientic evidence of a connection so I don’t think people need to worry.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is building up a few weeks of extra stock in Britain in case of any border delays. Likewise, several of its European deodorants, including Axe, Dove and Rexona are made in Britain and transported to the continent. A few weeks of extra inventory is one of the important steps we are taking to make sure that we minimise any disruption to our customers and consumers, said Alan Jope, Unilevers new chief executive.   He said weeks of inventory, not months and not days was the right amount for consumer packaged goods. One of the lessons we learn over and over again is when you do build inventory, it very often ends up being not exactly the right mix of products. With Britain at risk of leaving the European Union without a deal, Unilever is the latest consumer and retail firm to take such measures to keep imports and exports smooth. Unilever makes other British staples, such as Marmite spread, in Britain. Unilever is also increasing stocks of raw materials such as aluminium cans and cardboard. Such logistical costs are among those the Anglo-Dutch company has incurred this year to prepare for Brexit. The others are artwork changes to labels to prepare for dferent regulations and the hiring of customs experts.

When viewers were asked to vote for the most iconic human beings of the th century, only male figures made the final seven. Among them were deserving contenders such as Nelson Mandela , Pablo Picasso and ‘father of computing’ Alan Turing. But many - just as worthy - women didn’t get a look in, such as Nobel prize winner Marie Curie, suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst and Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe. Down the centuries women have played a central part in shaping the world, and the th century had more impressive women than ever - Rosa Parks, Florence Nightingale, Mother Teresa and Queen Elizabeth II, to name just a few.   So why, when presented with both the male and female history-makers, did viewers of the BBC show cast their votes for the men, not the women  A BBC spokesperson would only point out that the programme “gave the public their say on who should be crowned the greatest person of the th Century”. They added that three episodes were hosted by women and next Tuesdays final will have a female co-host. The poll is set to reignite the debate about why the writing and retelling of history is still skewered in favour of men, despite there being so many inspirational women. Incredibly, while women make up  per cent of the world’s population, they only occupy around . per cent of recorded history.   Historian Dr Bettany Hughes believes women have traditionally been “written out of history” - meaning that most people haven’t heard the stories of the female leaders, pioneers and trend-setters who have shaped our world. She said: “There are brilliantly feisty women from history who have made an impact, and whose stories need to be told. For historians it’s our job to fill in the gaps in history. “We need to actively look for women’s stories, and put them back into the historical narrative, there are so many women that should be household names but just aren’t.  “I don’t think there are malign forces at work here, it’s just a practical issue. Physically the stories of women have been written out of history, rather than written in.” Her theory was backed up by a survey for Women’s History Month in March , in which  per cent of respondents said they thought women hadn’t impacted history as much as men. June Purvis, professor of women and gender history at Portsmouth University, said history has always been written by men, about men. Its about mens activities, in politics, in war. Its led to the traditional view of history, that it was men who made it. It wasnt until the s that womens part in history began to be acknowledged. A lot of us now spend time trying to find women in the past and put them back into history to try to balance it out. But a lot still needs to be done, in schools, in higher education, and in popular history magazines who rarely feature women in their pages. Last year, Tess Davidson, a history finalist at King’s College, Cambridge, claimed that historical women were being sidelined at university history courses too, including Cambridge, where she claimed she was told incorporating women historical figures would be seen as too “feminist” for the more traditional academics. She said: During my studies Ive encountered the two extremes: the look of fear in a male historians eyes when you mention gender, and the tokenistic attempts at this kind of history, purely as a tick-box approach to political-correctness. To illustrate how women’s stories are often absent from school history lessons, she wrote: “As a curious project, I asked several of my friends to list off the top of their heads three famous women they knew from history. “I got the inevitable Thatcher reference, Elizabeth I, Cleopatra, as well as a few throw-backs to A-Level courses.  “But in the main, these were larger than le caricatures, figures referenced within popular culture as much as historical studies. “When pushed to suggest names of lesser known women, I was greeted with silence. “While by no means an exhaustive survey, it provides a brief insight nonetheless into the extent to which a separation of men and women has been incorporated into the teaching of history in schools.” In fact, women have often played more important roles than men in some of the key moments of history. Queen Victoria, for instance, oversaw the abolition of slavery around the world, brought in voting and labour reforms, and led Britain towards an era of unprecedented wealth and power with the industrial revolution and the expanding British empire. Among many little-known ancient warrior queens is Boudicca, who led a first century revolt against the Roman colonisation of Britain around BC, while her army of , sacked Colchester and then London.  AndEleanor of Aquitaine,Queen consort of France and England,was one of the most powerful and wealthy women in western Europe during the High Middle Ages. She led armies to victory in key battles several times in her le. Bettany Hughes says that to understand the problem of why women are underrepresented in the history books, you need to go back to pre-history, when women were actually more prominent than men. She added: “If you look at all the figurines made between about , BC, until around , BC – a period which really sees the flourishing of the modern mind - at that time around  per cent of all these figurines are of women. “So women are very present in the archaeological record, but then start to disappear once pre-history turns into history.” She explains that as civilisations wanted to expand, they began to value the military clout and muscle power of men more than the intellect and creativity of women. The retelling of history, then, started to focus on male figures and their successes.  Women, meanwhile, became mere footnotes in history - unless they could be portrayed as sexual seductresses. Bettany said: A lot of the women that we think of, like Cleopatra and Helen of Troy, one of the reasons their stories have lasted is that they are portrayed as highly sexualised. Cleopatra was a poet and a philosopher, she was incredible good at maths, she wasnt much of a looker. But when we think of her, we think: big breasted seductress in milk. Often, even when women have made their mark and they are remembered by history, we are offered a fantasy version of their lives. But she says there is still time to put things right and make sure history’s exceptional women receive the recognition they deserve.  She added: “Whenever I feel sad about how systematically women vanished from history, I take the long view, and say, there has been a problem here for at least , years, so it’s no surprise that we have some catching up to do. “But that in itself is quite empowering, because we know what we are up against. “This is an issue that has very deep roots, and we can see how and why that plays out, and therefore what we can do to start to change things. “What we need to do is make sure that collectively we are known as the generation that opened rather than closed minds, and who opened these stories up, and put them back onto the page and into our collective memory.” Who are the seven male finalists Nelson Mandela   Born in , Nelson Mandela was arrested in  and sentenced to le in prison on Rodden Island. He spent a huge amount of time in solitary confinement before he was finally released in  after massive global presure. Mandela was elected South Africas first free elections in  and instead of responding to the treatment of black people in the country, responded with the idea of the Rainbow Nation. His actions of governing for the while country and not just a section are credited with preventing South Africa crumbling into civil war. He died in  and his methods of forgiveness over revenge have been used as a model for other countries. Ernest Shackleton Shackleton was born in Kilkea, Ireland in . He was hailed a hero when, on an expedition to the South Pole, he and his crew got stranded in Antarctica. He refused to give up hope and sailed across almost frozen seas, before climbing across an island to reach help. Every, single member of his crew made it home alive. Alan Turing   Turing is the man widely credited with turning the tide of World War Two. he built a code cracking machine to speed up the time it took to decipher messages. Turing also invented the first computer. His legacy has also shaped attitudes in Britain. Turing was openly gay when homosexuality was illegal. He was arrested and had to chose between prison or chemical castration and opted for the latter. He was posthumously pardoned in .

Often described as the greatest boxer who ever live, something he even described himself as. Ali was never afraid to speak his mind and loudly proclaimed his political views. He was banned from boxing and even threatened with prison. Ali was diagnosed with Parkinsons Disease but continued his work outside the ring, even helping secure the freedom of  US hostages from Iraq after the  Gulf War. Pablo Picasso   The Spanish artists work spans a huge number of styles and genres. His abstract work influenced a whole generation of artists. And his used his paintings to push his political beliefs - painting Guernica when Spain was in the middle of a bloody civil war. And the women who could have made the final list Marie Curie  As a woman, Marie Curie was forced to study in secret. Despite this she was one of just three women to win the Nobel Prize for physics. Curie was the first person to coin the term radioactivity after realising certain elements gave off rays. Even though she suffered personal tragedy with the death of her husband she continued her research and even bought portable X-ray machines to treat troops on the frontline in World War One. Emmeline Pankhurst  A fierce campaigner for womens rights and votes in Britain. She funded the deeds not words movement and the women became known as suffragettes.

She did not dare to sit down even for a few minutes. Instead the terried schoolgirl stared at the wall, knowing her stepdad Paul Hemming could come back at any moment to check she was still there. So from pm until am, on a school night, she stood and waited. The crime she was being punshyshyished for  A forgotten piece of fruit. Kirstie says: “He found an apple in my school bag that had gone soft and he was really angry. He made me scrub out the bag and I had to stand in the naughty corner from pm until am –  hours. “He went to bed, but kept checking I was still standing.”   It is just one example of the abuse Kirstie, now , and her two siblings endured at the hands of the salesman before he killed their mum in the sitting room as they slept upstairs. Natalie Hemming was beaten and dumped in woods in . The investigation into the -year-old’s death was shown in heartbreaking detail in the documentary Catching a Killer. Kirstie is telling her story in a moving follow-up, Behind Closed Doors: Through the Eyes of the Child on BBC. For  years up to her murder, Natalie endured horrendous physical and emotional abuse, bullied by a man now described as a Jekyll and Hyde character. Kirstie and the two children Natalie had with Hemming – a son, eight, and daughter, six, who cannot be named – saw everything. They also bore the brunt of Hemming’s anger.   Until Natalie went missing Kirstie suffered in silence, like the one-in-five children in England and Wales who witness and experience domestic abuse. “I thought it was normal,” she says. “There were naughty corners all over the house I had to stand inI did something wrong. Anything could set him off.” Talking for the first time about her stepfather, jailed for le, Kirstie continues: “If I hadn’t hung my clothes up properly, orI got a bad grade at school... he got angry on a daily basis, mostlythings were untidy. “I wasn’t allowed out to play with friends or to bring them home. I was sent to bed without food for things like forgetting a piece of homework.” The only person who really knew the extent of her suffering was her mum, and she was powerless to help. “Mum would try and sneak food to me, but she wasn’t always able to. If she got found out, Paul would go mad.  “I once told a teacher that Daddy wasn’t being very nice. She did the right thing and told the head. It was reported to social services but they called Mum, who said everything was fine. “The file was closed the same day.” The abuse started in  after Natalie, then a -year-old single mum, moved in with Hemming,  years older. Natalie’s relationship with Kirstie’s dad Matthew, a naval officer, had broken down and she had postnatal depression. Things quickly deteriorated. Kirstie recalls: “When I was about four I got stuck in between Mum and Paul, who were shouting at each other. I was shyterried and went to my bedroom. “After that, when the fighting started, I’d go to my room and play with my toys. I had a rabbit called Thumper, I’d act out what was happenshyshying with him.” The incidents were never talked about as the family were so terried. Kirstie tells her story in the documentary along with three other victims of abusive and controlling fathers.To the outshy-side world, Hemming was a charmer attheir home inMilton Keynes,he was a monster. He was moody, sullen, controlled Natalie’s money and constantly checked up on her. When she wanted a job, Hemming told her he would pay her to stay home. Natalie’s sister Joanne Beverley, , says: “Natalie always said Paul had two faces – the face she and the children lived with and the face everyone  saw. “Natalie hinted that things were off, saying he was very obsessive. “Then she would defend him, saying he’d got obsessive compulsive disorder but was getting help for it. “She never told me too much as she knew I’d insist she left.” Jo lives in Wakefield, West Yorks, with her husband Stephen, , and four children, Lauren, , Morgan, , Charlie, five, and Isabelle, three. After the murder, she took in Kirstie and her half-sister. Jo’s other sister Kerry Hammond, , who has two sons, took in Natalie’s little boy. Jo, Kerry and their brothers Stephen, , and Sean, , all wish they could have done more to help Natalie. Jo says: “Once, we nearly managed to get her away from him. But Paul kept turning up, he wore her down in the end and she decided to go home.” Finally, Natalie planned to leave him after finding love with a colleague at the Mercedes dealership she worked at. Hemming, then , found out.  On May , , he beat Natalie to death, wrapped her body in a blanket, shoved her into his car boot and dumped her naked body in woodlands in shyChandlers Cross, Herts. Their son, then six, had heard the murder. He told police: “I heard a noise. I looked downstairs and peeked through the little door. Mum was lying down on the floor.” The children were traumatised. Jo says: “Kirstie was completely shut down when she came to live with me, she was almost robotic. Her sister didn’t speak for two months. She’s only just found the confidence to speak outside the home. “The day we heard Natalie’s body had been found, three weeks after she went missing, I told [the children]. “Kirstie sat showing no emotion. She was like a rabbit caught in the headlights. She only started talking about it after Hemming was sentenced.” Kirstie vividly recalls the last time she saw Natalie. “Mum was cuddled up on the sofa with a blanket on the Sunday night and I gave her a kiss.” When Natalie was not downstairs on Monday morning, Hemming lied to Kirstie and said that her mum was out with friends. After Natalie’s body was found, his web of lies began to unravel. He was charged with her murder and sentenced to a minimum of  years’ jail.  Though Kirstie says: “I was too frightened to talk. I didn’t even want to tell the police what I knew in case they told Paul. I knew he’d be really angry.” Jo has nurtured both girls back to good health. Kirstie has started her GCSEs and joined the Sea Cadets. She thinks she will join the Navy, like her mum did before having her, and her real dad is back in her le. She also wants to help other shyyoungsters suffering domestic violence. In a school of , children, statistics say  will experience it. Kirstie says: “I’m a patron of Operation Encompass, which supports children suffering abuse. If police are called to a house for domshyshyestic violence, they have to let the school know. Teachers can then talk to the children and ask themthey’re OK. “It’s really hard to go up to a teacher and tell them what’s happening, butsomeone comes to you it’s much easier to speak out.” Remembering her mum, she adds: “Mum loved sparkly shoes. We asked everyone to wear party shoes to her funeral. Mum was bubbly and fun.” Jo says: “Natalie was a great mum and a strong character. If domestic violence can happen to her, it can to anyone.” Behind Closed Doors: Through the Eyes of the Child, BBC at pm on Wednesday, February .

In the note – written after the Sunday Mirror revealed he had notbeen in touch with victim Emma Fairweather – the Duke, , said he was “shaken” by the collision. The typed -word message arrived six days after the smash near Sandringham and was signed “Yours sincerely, Philip” – in blue pen.Forensic handwriting expert Ruth Myers has now analysed the letter to decipher the hidden meanings behind his writing and what it reveals about his personality. Following the crash, many called for Prince Philip to give up driving but the defiant prince was back at the wheel just days later in a brand new Range Rover. And Ms Myers says this is of no surprise as his handwriting shows hes unlikely to change an opinion or decision even in the face of logic or reason.  Ms Myers believes that behind the royal facade, the great-grandfather has a desire for approval. She exclusively told the Mirror: Prince Philip’s handwriting indicates a writer with a good intellect who tries to exercise numerous built-in controls over his strong depth of feelings to keep him compatible. The angular writing denotes a critical and somewhat forceful personality, having strong likes and dislikes. He likes a challenge and can inspire others with his initiative, high standards and enthusiasm, his creative ability with artistic leanings helps him to accomplish and achieve goals with zeal and fervour. However, he has a short fuse and when provoked can retort with caustic comments.   Anxious to maintain a good image he appreciates the importance of his role in le having a desire for approval. An inidual personality he may show indference to conventional commitments and is unlikely to change an opinion or decision even in the face of logic or reason. Ms Myers added: He does not always face up to problems and will find excuses for his actions by denying dficulties and rationalising by avoiding them and thereby his conscience is clear. Sensitive to criticism although hurt will go his own way. It is dficult for him to forgive past injustices.   Prince Philip can relate readily to others but in reality he can enjoy working alone and is happy in his own company selective in his choice of friendship. Lover of good living he enjoys luxury and quality appreciating and enjoying deeply all that influences the senses. Although he is communicative he keeps his own counsel and his conversation will be guarded as he is able to conceal pertinent facts he will be secretive and thus able to skirt issues. Emma, , a care support worker, was left in crippling pain after the crash.   She has been signed off for two months and has instructed solicitors to pursue a compensation claim. The Kia that was in collision with the Dukes x was driven by her friend Ellie Townsend, . Ellie’s nine-month-old son was also in the car. Although Prince Philip refers to it being sunny, Emma recalls the day being overcast. She said: “He’s tried to give an explanation so I appreciate that, whether I agree with it or not.

The child, who cannot be identied for legal reasons, suffered serious burns to his face and arm. His -year-old father is charged with being involved in the attack, which happened at a Home Bargains store in Worcester on July  last year. The dad was involved in a parental custody dispute, jurors heard. A trial jury at Worcester Crown Court was told how the injured child screamed I hurt, over and over again, after being struck.  On Thursday, jurors were shown the stores CCTV video capturing the moment the incident took place. The attack happened in a matter of seconds while the child was standing with his brother looking at toy footballs. The boys dad is accused of conspiring to unlawfully or maliciously cast or throw sulphuric acid on or at the boy, with intent to burn, maim, disfigure or disable the minor, or do grievous bodily harm. Prosecutors allege the father, stung by his we walking out on him and taking the children in April , enlisted others to attack the youngster in a bid to win more contact with the child by painting her as an unfit mother. As the clip was played, the boys father, sat in the dock, held a tissue to his face. Facing the same charge are Adam Cech, , of Farnham Road, Birmingham Jan Dudi, , of Cranbrook Road, Birmingham Norbert Pulko, , of Sutherland Road, London Martina Badiova, , of Newcombe Road, Handsworth, Birmingham Saied Hussini, , of Wrottesley Road, London and Jabar Paktia, , of Newhampton Road, Wolverhampton.  They all deny the allegation. In his opening last week, Jonathan Rees QC, for the Crown, said the boys mother had driven to the store with her children at about pm to buy a party gt. Roadside CCTV played in court showed her being followed by a silver Vauxhall Vectra, allegedly containing Cech, Dudi and Pulko. At .pm she and the children went inside the store, followed shortly after by the three men, with shop CCTV showing Cech approaching the victim. Both youngsters were gazing at a brightly coloured display of footballs at the end of an aisle. The victim could then be seen pointing up at the balls, with his sibling doing practice kicks, as a man in a white T-shirt, identied without dispute in court as Cech, walked past the victim with his arm extended and an object in his hand.  As Cech exited the frame, the victim could be seen looking quickly back towards him before running to his mother nearby. Mr Rees told jurors: What you have just seen is that person in a white T-shirt - you can just catch the moment where the arm is extended. That really is the hub of this case. That is the acid attack. It is over in a split second. You have, in shot, Mr Cech - theres no dispute of that - extending his arm, out towards the child. Mr Rees added: His mother was a short distance away as the attack is carried out, and the sister heard the victim scream out, I hurt, I hurt, I hurt. The boy suffered a cm burn to his left forearm, and a cm burn on his forehead, which needed specialist hospital treatment.  The Crown have also claimed that Hussini, Pulko and Badiova were involved in an aborted attempt near a school, eight days prior to the shop attack. Witnesses were so concerned about the trios suspicious activity they took photos, which have formed part of the prosecutions case. On Wednesday, jurors also heard for the first time how the father sent an image with the text Nailed It! to an alleged co-conspirator, hours after his son had been injured. Running through details of contact alleged between the accused, Mr Rees said cell-siting of mobile phones showed Dudi, Cech and Pulko leaving the area near Home Bargains, immediately following the incident. Phone call log evidence is alleged to have shown that Pulko called Paktia, before Paktia then rang the boys father - some  minutes after the attack.  It is alleged that Pulko then met up with Paktia somewhere in the Birmingham area at about .pm. About an hour later, cell-siting showed Paktia and the fathers phones were back in the Wolverhampton area, Mr Rees told jurors. The Crowns QC then drew the jurys attention to what he described as some stickers being sent with mots and images, from the victims father to Paktia, later that evening. The first showed a cartoon image of what appeared to be a deer, leaning over and comforting a tearful fox.  Mr Rees said: At .pm, hesends Paktia a sticker. One animal comforting a fox which has its head in its hands. And then, the second is sent, a minute after that first one, again to Paktia. It is a sticker which features a young lady in it with the mot Nailed It!. The trial continues.

But the boys mother then came over - and said Gracies arm shouldnt be so obvious because it was scaring other children. Gracie had been wearing a short sleeved dress at the soft play centre in Llanelli, West Wales.   Mum-of-four Sarah said: Gracie was happily playing when a little boy started to take an interest in her small arm. This happens a lot and Im not very comfortable with people staring but children are curious and thats okay. But then the little boy started to say he was scared so I took Gracie and moved her to play with her brothers in a dferent part of the playground. Thats when the boys mother came over. She said I shouldnt make Gracies arm so obvious because it was scaring the children. I was so angry I just gathered up the kids and left. I didnt trust myself to respond.  Nurse Sarah said it isnt the first time she has had cruel comments made about Gracie in public. She said: Ive started to dread going to play groups and soft play because of the negative attention. One time an older boy was circling Gracie and pointing and laughing while his parents just looked on. People dont know what to say. I dont knowthey feel awkward but its cruel to allow that bullying and its the parents I blame not the kids. Gracie lives with mum Sarah, dad Gareth Morgan,  and her brothers Cai, nine, Codi, five, and Alfie, three.  She was diagnosed with having a limb dference during the  week anomaly scan in October . Sarah is now calling for people to think about Gracies feelings before making mean comments. She added: At the moment Grace is young and doesnt understand. Nothing stops her and I want her to always be that way. Shell hold a crisp packet between her feet and use her right hand to eat.

The stories from the Barnsley leg of our Wigan Pier Project – the final stop on our and George Orwell’s  journey – are some of the most moving of all. Antonia Robson, , holding her eight-month-old son Hunter, saying that “hard-working families” like hers “get nothing”, and that “everyone I know is in debt”. Jessica Fox, , a mother of two young children with no income, and no support because her family has just been transferred onto Universal Credit .  Peter Robertshaw, , an unemployed father-of-two collecting food via a charity voucher scheme at the market for his two young children, one of whom giggles as she stuffs a banana hungrily into her mouth. What’s harder to understand is how any government could take a town struggling with losing its traditional industries to the zero-hour economy, and slash its budgets by an shyeye-watering %. But this is exactly what the Tories have done over the last eight years, according to research from the Centre for Cities. It’s a figure around four times the average reduction faced by councils in the South East, and has led to hugely damaging cuts to public services. It seems we weren’t “in it all together” after all. Barnsley – which once defied Margaret Thatcher during the Miners’ Strike – is used to being attacked by the Tories. So, news that Theresa May now plans to bribe the MPs of Leave-voting “coalfield” constituencies like theirs with cash will be seen for exactly what it is. The desperate act of a Prime Minister whose plan has simply unravelled.  The Government has had almost three years since the referendum to loosen the screws in austerity-stricken areas. If it had done so, the country could have been in a totally dferent place by now. Instead, Theresa May is left waving tawdry pound notes at a shycommunity that’s already only surviving – like in the Miners’ Strike days – through local shysolidarity. And all the while she plans to engineer a hard Brexit from which that community can only lose. Let’s hope this bribery goes better than the great DUP bribe, which has proceeded with all the aplomb and dignity of a kid trying to buy off the school bully with sweets – only to find, they want paying again and again and again. At least May’s offer is also an admission that there is a link between austerity cuts and Brexit, that the Tories usually firmly deny. If you cross-reference the new Centre for Cities research with Brexit vote figures, a pattern starts to emerge. Barnsley, which leads the austerity cuts league table by a long chalk, voted .% to Leave the EU. Oxford – where budgets have actually gone up .% over the last eight years – voted % Remain.  On the list, only shyLiverpool – second in the cuts league table – bucks the trend. Assailed by austerity cuts so deep they are reminiscent of Thatcher’s ‘managed decline’ plan for the city in the s, Liverpool – which has been regenerated by EU money – voted .% to stay, but much of the rest of Merseyside voted to come out. One factor given by some experts was the city’s lack of exposure to the Sun newspaper, due to the mass boycott that remains since shythat paper’s Hillsborough coverage. Next on the list, Doncaster, third worst hit , voted % out. Wakefield, in fourth place , voted .% leave. In fth place, shyBlackburnvoted by .% to Leave. The scale of these cuts – deliberately devolved by a Tory government shyoverwhelmingly to Labour councils – are not accidental but were embedded in the very architecture of George Osborne’s austerity plan. He knew the councils with the highest social burden would not only struggle to raise extra revenue, but would also need more money to support the poor, disabled and elderly.  The result has been devastating. It’s worth remembering this every time the former Chancellor pops up on TV documentaries with a sad shake of his head, trying to look like the sensible one who failed to persuade his mate Dave Cameron not to hold the shyreferendum. These were Osborne’s vicious cuts, aided and abetted by the wild-eyed ideologue Iain Duncan Smith. And to me, when the day of reckoning comes, this remains not just Cameron’s but Osborne’s Brexit. In the meantime, what Barnsley needs is to be treated like the Tories treat their own heartlands – with a bit of respect and fairness. It needs an end to this punishing, disproportionate, bitter austerity and a crackdown on employment agencies exploiting zero-hour workers. It needs new jobs and fresh hope. It doesn’t need a bung of cash – just a bit of old-fashioned social and economic justice. Imagine what a town with the grit, spirit and solidarity of Barnsley could do with some support, instead of constant assault.Wiganpierproject"},{"url":null,"title":"six year old boy removed","story":"NewsSix-year-old boy removed from primary school after bringing kne to playgroundConcerned parents believe that the incident at Westborough Primary School in Southend, Essex has been \"swept under the carpet\"ShareCommentsByIsaac Crowson:,  JAN NewsThe six-year-old was removed from Westborough Primary School\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A six-year boy has been taken out of school after he brought a kne to the playground. The pupil took the kne to the school and showed it to a fellow classmate.The incident is said to have taken place at Westborough Primary School in Southend, Essex. Parents have been left feeling worried and believe the discovery was swept under the carpet. One mother, who was made aware by another worried parent on the playground, said she feels everyone should have been made aware.   The woman, who does not want to be named, told the Southend Echo: Its absolutely shocking that a six-year-old is bringing a kne to school. I was horried. My initial reaction was one of anger and fear for my child because you do worry about your children going there and you dont expect a six-year-old to bring a kne to school. I understand there is scaremongering but with an incident as serious as this, I do think all parents should have been made aware so that we could decide what measures to put in place for our children. It feels like it was swept under the carpet. I just hope the school would deal with something like this robustly to make sure it doesnt happen again.   The discovery was made in September. Headteacher Tonya Brook said: This was an isolated incident where a six-year-old brought a small paring kne into school in his book bag. He showed it to another child. It did not come out of the bag. A member of Senior Management was on the playground to deal with the issue immediately. The child was subsequently removed from the school. All relevant parties were informed. Other members of the public were also concerned at the news on social media.   One woman said: How the hell does a six-year-old manage to take a kne to school without their parents knowing ! Another said: I talked to my son about this - it’s awful isn’t it. Hopefully us parents who are parents will steer our children in the right direction.One woman said: It’s a bit worrying that as a parent I’m finding all of this out on Facebook and that a statement wasn’t issued to parents about it.A spokeswoman for the school said no further comment would be made.

Friday night.And Clark admits it wasn’t good enough from the Tangerines.He added: “We went down to Ayr with full intentions of winning the game.“We gave ourselves a chance a couple of weeks ago against Dunfermline when we won and got ourselves up the league but we let ourselves and the fans down on Friday.“The weather meant it was never going to be a pretty game and they got a chance early on and took it.“I think we only had one real chance with Aidan towards the end where the goalie was out quick and made a good save.“All in all it was a very frustrating night and we were very disappointed.”Strong winds made le dficult for all the players but it was clear Ian McCall’s men coped far better with the conditions than United.The home side dominated the opening period and got their goal through Craig Moore early on but the expected response from the Tangerines with the wind in their favour in the second half never really materialised.Clark added: “It was dficult conditions but we’ve all played in wind like that before, we all know what it’s like.“We had a game plan – I don’t knowwe didn’t stick to it but it never happened for us.“We’re disappointed because that’s nine points we’ve given Ayr this season and we’re making it very hard for ourselves.”It’s been a stop-start first season at the club for Clark with a series of injuries curtailing his first-team opportunities.Now, though, he says he’s back to % and ready to help United get back on track.“It’s been very frustrating for me, I’ve missed a lot of games with daft wee injuries here and there where you can’t actually treat them, you just have to leave them until they get better.“It’s been frustrating but I’m back and feeling good now so, hopefully, I can kick on now and help the team get where we want to be.”"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee united man one of two new arrivals at dundee","story":"Dundee have completed a double transfer swoop today.The club have secured the loan signings

games","story":"Despite the major disappointment of the defeat at Ayr United, the consolation for Dundee United fans at the moment has to be the fact they have become genuine promotion contenders under Robbie Neilson.The gap to the top of the table has stretched to six points again because of that Friday night loss at Somerset Park coupled with Ross County’s victory over Alloa on Saturday afternoon.It can’t be forgotten United’s poor goal dference effectively means right now the gap to the top is seven points.With just  games to go, time is also running out for United to make up the lost ground and clinch promotion at the first time of asking.Boosted by the January signings that are set to continue in the final few days of the window,they can gel quickly enough, Neilson will believe the deficit can by clawed back and, in a Championship race that’s seen every team drop points regularly, even a decent winning run could do that.The manager’s overall record since he arrived in October does also give some reason for Arabs not to give up hope just yet.Since his debut win at Partick Thistle in mid-October, with , his team are the leading points gatherers in the second tier.By beating Alloa in Dingwall on Saturday, County took their points tally over the same period to  and while no one would argue the fact promoted Ayr are having an excellent first campaign back at this level, they have been showing signs of running out of steam.Between their hugely impressive - win at Tannadice right at the end of November and their repeat success over United the other night, Ian McCall’s team had gone five league games without a win and also, of course, suffered that humiliating Scottish Cup exit at the hands of juniors Auchinleck Talbot.If that, and the points tally under the new manager, provides encouragement, what continues to be a major concern for United is their poor record against the others at the top end of the table.Friday was their fth clash with the top two on league business and, to date, the record reads played five, lost four, won one, score two and conceded .Add to that a League Cup loss up at County in July and what you have is a worrying statistic.Without wishing to paint an even darker picture, they have also only drawn two clashes with Inverness with both coming when the Highlanders were sitting in one of the promotion play-off places.If they are to realise American owner Mark Ogren’s dream of going up automatically during his first months in charge, it’s a statement of the obvious to say the big-game record has to improve drastically.Should it, United can still get to where they want to be. They’ve two games to come against County and one final crack at Ayr and, of those showdowns, two are at Tannadice.Yes, the two heaviest defeats of the season came there against County and Ayr but under Neilson that second defeat was the only one he’s suffered in seven home games so far.And last time he sent out a team to face County he did mastermind what was without doubt the best win of the campaign to date, a gritty - success on their patch, in November.If the manager can mould his rebuilt team over the next few weeks, wins like that one can be repeated.They’ll have to be, or United’s big-game failures will see them negotiating even more vital outings in the play-offs."},{"url":null,"title":"vandals jump on five cars at perth car dealership did you see them","story":"Police have issued a statement after vandals damaged five cars at the forecourt of a car dealership.The cars at the dealership in Manson Road, Perth were damaged  sometime between Tuesday January  and Saturday January .A police statement said: #It is understood that vandals jumped between the cars damaging the bonnets.#The damage is valued at approximately £,.#Anyone with any information should contact Police Scotland on , quoting CR   or speak to any police officers.#Alternativelyyou have any information about the incident you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers % anonymously on    or via their Anonymous Online Form at crimestoppers-uk.org.#"},{"url":null,"title":"well that was easy fans respond as queen of the south taunt wee dundee","story":"Dundee fans have responded to taunts from Queen of the South before and after yesterday#s Scottish Cup clash.A hat-trick by Stephen Dobbie gave the Doonhammers a - win over Dundee in last night#s Fourth Round replay.Even before proceedings got under way at Palmerston Park, the home side stuck the boot in to the Dark Blues by tweeting: #Good evening and welcome to tonight’s Scottish Cup replay against Dundee’s wee team.#After a - draw at Dens Park  days ago, a cup tie away to Aberdeen or Stenhousemuir awaits…#mdash Queen of the SouthJanuary , The message was warmly received by Arabs but some Dundee fans were less than complimentary.Peter Sayers wrote: #Hope we pump you tinpot lot now.Kevin Steele tweeted: #Really and you can#t play on grass.#After the Dumfries side swept to victory Queens rubbed salt into the wounds with another inflammatory tweet.#Well that was easy.

But Mr Middleton said that the sign was being ignored and there was a danger at the bend where cyclists meet traffic.Speed reducing tables have been installed at the site, but Mr Middleton said: ldquoCars are going over the raised tables at mph and then drivers are putting the foot down in between them.He has reported his concerns to the council who carried out a survey in May last year. It revealed the average speed in the mph zone at the busiest time in the morning is .mph.He is now urging the council to instal signs to alert the drivers to the oncoming cyclists or a speed indicating devicewhich will show road users their speed.The path is used by pupils from Lochardil Primary, Inverness Royal Academy Holm Primary and the Gaelic school.Mr Middleton fears young people on the path may not be seen by fast moving vehicles: ldquoWe have crossed this road many times andin the company of two or four of my grandchildren this is more dficult, the main reason for this is in estimating the speed of accelerating vehicles since the tables were installed said Mr Middleton.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoA mph zone was recently installed in the Culduthel Lochardil area at the request of the community council.

especially in this weather, she said.ldquoEvery parent that sends their child to school by bus is depending on the council to ensure that happens safely.ldquoIt is the councilrsquos responsibility as corporate parent to ensure these children get to school safely.A spokeswoman for Stagecoach North Scotland said: ldquoSince we started operating the additional school contracts on January  there have been some issues with capacity we have identied and are working to resolve.ldquoWe are working closely with Highland Council to resolve these problems by issuing school children with passes allocating them to specic buses to prevent the overloading problems we have seen.She added that in terms of the issues raised by Mrs Paterson an additional bus is now running to and from Croy.Thursday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119409.jpg","title":"Site for Inverness homes not acceptable","story":"Councillor Ken Gowans hit out at the application by agent Bracewell-Stirling for DMPM Services.He said the site was not zoned for housing and would pile pressure on local school rolls which are already well over  per cent capacity.ldquoWhile we need more affordable houses, any development must be part of the local plan, and this development is not.ldquoThis is likely to generate more unacceptable pressures on infrastructure which is already struggling to cope at the moment.ldquoWhile developers pay contributions towards education, it doesnrsquot change the fact that local schools are beyond full, and the councilrsquos school roll projections indicate these will worsen in the short to medium term, he said.Highlands MSP and road safety campaigner David Stewart also expressed some concern: ldquoI am mindful that the dual A will be at one side of this site and the rural B road will extend along another side of the site.ldquoAs it stands, this particular road has no pavement for pedestrians and this would be an issue that would cause me concern.Thursday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117111.jpg","title":"Work starts on new outlets at Eastgate Shopping Centre","story":"WORK has begun at the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness to develop four food outlets.The units, suitable for restaurant or bar operators, are being created by the reconfiguration of two existing shops fronting Falcon Square.Burger King UK is the first operator to sign up while talks are ongoing with operators for the other units.In addition, a new kiosk will be created fronting the Falcon Square mall entrance.

Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -.

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

A senior source said: “The UK Government’s contribution to the Ayrshire Growth Deal will be in the region of pound million. “It’s clear from the growth deal process that a lot of very exciting projects have been put forward. We are confident the deal can deliver a massive boost to the local economy.” The Ayrshire Growth Deal will provide signicant investment in the key sectors of aerospace and space at Prestwick, le sciences, manufacturing and tourism. It has been talked about for years as a poundm fund but the Scottish Government and three Ayrshire councils have all failed to reveal their financial input. The aim is to make key investments that will grow the economy and lead to , new jobs.  To do that the poundm public sector finance will have to trigger poundbillion of private investment. It is widely accepted Ayrshire has missed out on big investment deals as it has three councils scrapping for superiority, rather than a single strategic voice. Growth money is expected to be spent on luring a medicines manufacturing innovation centre, developing brownfield sites for industry, improving the Bellfield Interchange, upgrading digital infrastructure and free port status at Prestwick , the Port of Ayr and Falkland Rail Yard in Ayr and a renewable energy hub in Cumnock. It is expected the signing of heads of terms - the stage when all the ious partners get together and announce which projects will receive funding - will be reached within several months. All seven of Scotland’s cities are now covered by the deals and Ayrshire is in the first wave of regions.

But Smith, of Castle Croft, Dalmellington, admitted shoving the barrel of the rle into the home. And the victims inside cowered in fear as they could hear Smith shouting “Get out here, get our here.” CCTV footage captured the pair on their threatening violent spree. Almost every window in the home had been smashed and holes in the windows were consistent with shots of the rle. Blood smears were spotted on the living room window. Police were called and discovered the metal pole used by Smith the following morning. A search warrant in Smith’s home uncovered pellets for an air rle in a box within her bedroom. But she told officers that the other person had been carrying the gun and she had never seen the gun before. She also stated that she threw the metal pole away as she believed the other person would have used it. Solicitor Steven Maxwell told the court he had viewed the footage. The lawyer commented: “It’s quite clear that she was quite literally in his stead and following him. “She cannot provide the court any reasonable explanation of how she managed to get herself in this situation but she was using and abusing drink and illegal substances. “At the time she would have followed this man where-ever he went. “If you fly with the crows, you get shot with them.

This includes working from home and flexible working practices to ensure that nobody should lose pay or holidays.ldquoThe move by East Lothian appears to be nothing other than an exercise in saving money and will not go unchallenged.At Tuesdayrsquos meeting in Haddington, the councilrsquos chief executive Angela Leitch told councillors thatstaff could not fulfil their contract, the council ldquocould not pay them.Anger over the way the council handled last yearrsquos severe snow storms led councillors to overturn a long-standing policy on absences and agree to pay workers who had been unable to get into work.Many workers were stunned to be told that, while police were warning people to stay at home, the council was continuing with its established policy advising them they would have to take time in lieu or unpaid leave to cover the time they were unable to work.While other local authorities, including City of Edinburgh Council, took to social media to assure staff they would be paidthey were unable to work during the Wednesday and Thursday of the red weather warnings last March, East Lothian Council repeated its advice that workers should report to workit was ldquosafe to do so, or attend the nearest council office or suitable premises, or work from home or other suitable locations.Following a review, wages were reinstated for those who missed work during red weather warnings and the policy was reviewed.Councillor Willie Innes , council leader, said he expected that, should another Beast from the East hit the county, councillors would once again step in to ensure wages were not docked.He said: ldquoIt is impossible to have a policy that pleases everyone. Last year, members took the decision to pay staff ndash I would hopeit happened again we would consider making similar commitments.South of Scotland list MSP Michelle Ballantynecondemned the policy, saying: ldquoIt is completely unacceptable for East Lothian Council to tell their employees to save their holiday time in case of bad weather. It beggars belief that any employer would be this unreasonable. I will be writing to Willie Innes about how deeply unfair his cabinet have been to hardworking council staff.A statement issued on Wednesday by Ms Leitch, the councilrsquos chief executive, said: ldquoThe policy has been refreshed following last yearrsquos severe wintry weather.ldquoThe updated policy reflects feedback following staff consultation, and is consistent with the approach taken by many other public sector organisations.ldquoIt reflects the councilrsquos commitment to protecting the health and safety of all employees, while minimising disruption and maintaining key public services where possible.ldquoIt recognises that employees may periodically face dficulties in attending work during periods of severe weather, or some other adverse event. The policy makes it clear that staff should only travelit is safe to do so.ldquoThe updated policy contains additional advice for staff on what to do in such unusual circumstances.ldquoThe key aspect of the updated policy is to stress the importance of Business Continuity Plans for each council service which advise on what employees should do in any adverse event ndash including potential alternative working arrangements for employeesthey canrsquot get to their normal place of work.ldquoThis includes working remotely or being deployed near to where they live as an alternative."},{"url":null,"title":"135m-needed-for-our-schools","story":"East Lothian is facing an influx of families, with , new homes expected to be delivered across its communities by .East Lothian Council estimates it will have to find at least pound million itself ndash with additional money from housing developers and the Scottish Government required.A report before councillors at last Tuesdayrsquos cabinet meeting in Haddington said that one new secondary school and three new or replacement primary schools were needed to meet established and future demand ndash no locations have been identied in the report.It added that the council would also need to fund ldquoextensions and alterations to approximately  existing primary schools for similar reasons.The report also revealed that the council would have to extend and alter a further  primary schools, as well as creating two new early year centres, to meet an increase in early learning and childcare hours from  to , hours.The report, which outlines the councilrsquos Community Asset Strategy and Management Plan for the next five years, states: ldquoInvestment in new or extended facilities is directed towards those areas of infrastructure which are required to support growth in the authority and in particular in the education learning estate.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

However what we have with this announcement by npower is a kick in the teeth for the workforce, many of whom are GMB members.ldquoIt is only a few short years ago that npower offshored customer relations work and in the process closed sites in the North East and rationalised work around Rainton Bridge in Houghton-le-Spring.ldquoThe company then brought that work back into the UK when that

I still have many of the books I bought with pocket money when I was young, carried through le like a lucky charm. TS Eliotrsquos Prufrock may have measured out his le with coffee spoons I have measured out mine with Puffins and King Penguins, Peregrines and Pelicans. If pressed, I could tell where I found each one.Like radio, the demise of the book has been often foretold. Books, we were unreliably informed, were yesterdayrsquos technology, so th century, so redundant in a digital age. I well recall the gleeful obituaries. The internet would sweep them away with tsunami-like ferocity. Kindles, apparently, were the future, and even I owned one once. Who knows where it lies unloved now. And who cares Similar prophesies of doom were made about bookshops, for what need was there for themno one wanted books  And for a while things did look a bit glum. With the demise of the Net Book Agreement, which determined that books must be sold at their cover price, many privately-owned bookshops found they couldnrsquot compete with the discounts offered by supermarkets and chain stores. Inevitably, sadly, some went to the wall or sold out to more voracious competitors.Of late, however, in what has been the bleakest of midwinters for the high street, there are signs that reports of the death of the bookshop were premature. In the last couple of weeks, I have heard of two new bookshops opening in Edinburgh. And last Saturday evening, I attended a mini book festival in Linlithgow, organised by the local independent, Far From the Madding Crowd, which was very well-attended, a testimony to the loyalty and warmth the shop engenders.The best bookshops are like that. When one of them is threatened it is a cause for mourning and resentment and the raising of petitions. For me, a town without a bookshop is unworthy of the name, a place where civilisation is yet to reach, where culture must surely fail to thrive. I have been in such outposts and nothing would drag me back.Where there is at least one bookshop there is hope. A year ago, I visited Christchurch in New Zealand, which is still struggling to recover from the devastating earthquakes of  and . The centre of the city was preternaturally quiet and the shopping mall was bereft of customers. But the one shop that was buzzing was Scorpio Books, also independently owned, which against all odds had managed to resurrect itself. Would the same, brave decision have been made by the fund managers who control chain stores  Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.One of the new Edinburgh shops will be Toppingrsquos, which has a wonderful branch in St Andrews. The companyrsquos founder is Robert Topping, formerly of Waterstonersquos in Manchester, which he left after being told to limit the size of the stock. The story is told in a new memoir by Glasgow-born Sir Tim Waterstone, of whom I was briefly an employee ndash the least said about which the better. ldquoThe Waterstonersquos model, recalls Sir Tim, ldquowas simply this: the highest class of heavily stocked literary bookselling run on a national scale by an unusually enthusiastic and highly knowledgeable young staff.Waterstonersquos was born in  when the book trade was in dire of need of modernisation. Complacent, rival shops kept short hours and unsatisfying stock, and their staff were more inclined to turn custom away than welcome it. Waterstonersquos ndash which was in the vanguard of Sunday opening ndash initiated a bookselling revolution and played an intrinsic role in making the literary novel cool. In the store in which I worked, on any given night you might catch a reading by Gore Vidal, Richard Ford, Raymond Carver or Edna OrsquoBrien. It was like a club of which anyone could become a member.Scratch any writer and they will regale you with tales of their favourite bookshops. I have one ndash Main Street Trading in St Boswells ndash a handful of miles from where I live in the Borders.

As well as managing Josef K, the future TV producer had picked up Article  for his Rational Records label. This was after Alan Horne, who co-produced the record with Josef K guitarist Malcolm Ross, passed on the band in favour of signing Aztec Camera.ldquoAllan said to me, the future lies in the past, MacIntyre beams as he prepares to celebrate  years of running the conceptual ideas factory that is the Creeping Bent Organisation. ldquoThat period in Edinburgh was really exciting. It felt like people were having great ideas every week. Hearing the Scars record the first time, walking into the Tap OrsquoLauriston and seeing Josef K and Fire Engines sitting there, for a kid from Strathaven that was really exciting. There was something in the air at that time. It wasnrsquot just the music, it was about literature and art as well. When John Peel played Article , the excitement of that is something Irsquove been chasing ever since.Campbellrsquos pearl of possibly appropriated Proustian wisdom bears long-term fruit this coming weekend at a very special one-night extravaganza programmed as part of Celtic Connections. Things Are Tough, We Can Still Picnic takes place at Glasgow arts lab, the CCA, and features the world premieres of two very special musical troupes. Not for nothing, it seems, was Article rsquos three-minute opus titled Event to Come.First up, MacIntyre will unveil his own Port Sulphur project, a Creeping Bent house band of sorts, whose live incarnation features a pan-generational pedigree of artists including former Orange Juice guitarist James Kirk and ex Aztec Camera bassist Campbell Owens. MacIntyre likens it to ldquoa post-modern version of Booker T and The MGs.Port Sulphurrsquos first foray into the world was with the motorik strains of the knowingly named Fast Boys and Factory Girls single. This featured on full- follow-up, Paranoic Critical, while the live set will also feature excerpts from Valentinorsquos, a collection of musical sense memories named after Campbellrsquos Rational era club and available for one day only on February th.ldquoPort Sulphur is effectively my indulgence, MacIntyre says of what began as a solo project excavating half-formed recordings and reconstructing them using chance elements drawn from Luke Rhinehartrsquos novel, The Dice Man, and Brian Enorsquos oblique strategies. ldquoThe initial idea was to have no collaborators, and taking any notions of authenticity out of the project was really liberating for me.Things changed, however, and MacIntyre started seeking musical responses to what already existed from a pantheon of fellow travellers.ldquoOnce you have Vic Godard or Davy Henderson from the Sexual Objects on a song it becomes amazing, says MacIntyre, ldquoand you let them sculpt those songs the way they would rather than how Irsquod do it. The best example of that was when I gave James Kirk a really electronic track, and it came back sounding like Orange Juice.Sharing joint headline status is Pop Group guitarist Gareth Sager and the new beat combo he styles as The Hungry Ghosts. Sagerrsquos musical eclecticism has seen him move from the incendiary ferocity of The Pop Group, through the free jazz playfulness of Rip, Rig and Panic, the punk-funk of Head and even a Debussy and Satie influenced solo piano record recorded at Abbey Road.The Hungry Ghosts, however, strip things down to what Sager styles as ldquostomp-glam-funk. Irsquove made about  albums, and Irsquove never put any limits on what I do, but it felt like the right time to do something just with guitar, bass and drums and nothing . Irsquove never written in a purely rock and roll context before, and I wanted to seethe songs would stand up without me being tempted to put strings or a Hammond organ on them.The results of this back to basics approach can be heard on Juicy Rivers, which forms the third part of Sagerrsquos Creeping Bent triptych begun with The Last Second of Normal Time, first released in , with the second part, rsquos Slack Slack Music, just released in a new CD edition.Sager also appears on Paranoic Critical, providing loops and fuzz clarinet on constructions based around the vocals of poet and sometime collaborator, the late Jock Scot on one track, and the also departed Suicide vocalist Alan Vega on the other.ldquoItrsquos not everyone whorsquod phone me up and ask to put music to this recording by Alan Vega, says Sager, ldquobut Douglas is a maverick, and I think itrsquos important as we become an older generation not to just curl up in front of the TV, but to get out there and do what you want to do whatever age you are.Friday nightrsquos extravaganza will be presented under the guise of Everything Flows, a happening new lsquocultural events organisationrsquo which has already hosted German record label Marinarsquos similarly styled quarter-century shindig. This weekendrsquos event, which also features support from nouveau indie janglers The Plastic Youth, looks set to be even more conceptual. Itrsquos attitude dates back to A Leap into the Void, the Yves Klein referencing multi-media extravaganza that launched Creeping Bent at Tramway in Glasgow back in .ldquoTo me, Creeping Bent isnrsquot a record label, says MacIntyre. ldquoItrsquos an art project. We believe in having total control over the means of production.This is something picked up from Bob Last and Hilary Morrisonrsquos Edinburgh sired Fast Product imprint, which understood the value of packaging, both in terms of visual identity and putting on events rather than plain old gigs. Itrsquos also about working with artists over a long period of time.ldquoA core part of Creeping Bent has been working with Gareth and with Davy Henderson, says MacIntyre. ldquoWhat theyrsquore doing is really valuable, and itrsquos not a nostalgia trip. The work theyrsquore producing today matters as much as anything theyrsquove done at any time in their careers. Theyrsquore great artists, and itrsquos important to get their work out there.Key to Creeping Bentrsquos cross-generational continuum is Green Door, the Glasgow-based studio credited on Paranoic Critical which has become a musical think-tank for some of the most interesting younger musical auteurs in town. This includes Sam Joseph Smith, who will play as part of Port Sulphur on Friday.ldquoItrsquos great being around the place, says MacIntyre. ldquoIt feels like anything interesting coming out of Glasgow just now is coming out of Green Door. For us, working in that environment and seeing whatrsquos going on is really exciting. Itrsquos all about keeping your antennae up on whatrsquos happening, he says, ldquoand then stealing it.Things Are Tough, We Can Still Picnic,  Years of the Creeping Bent Organisation, featuring Gareth Sager and The Hungry Ghosts, Port Sulphur and The Plastic Youth, CCA, Glasgow as part of Celtic Connections, February .

Complaints are currently handled by Ofcom.Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ldquoMobile companies should be doing more to help their customers save on data they donrsquot use, especially when itrsquos clear people are consistently underusing their allowance.ldquoThis is another example of mobile companies overcharging their customers.

A statement is expected this morning.The second demand is for a longer-term commitment to overhaul local taxation.The Greens want to replace council tax with a % annual property levy, and for councils to have far greater powers to raise their own taxes and set business rates.It is understood the government has agreed to discuss council tax reform, possibly through a cross-party forum, with a view to legislation by the end of this parliament.However it would probably for the next parliament to decide whether to pass any new law.In the short term, the government will also consider new local taxes such as a tourist tax.The financial and political demands come as a package - unless the Greens agree to the revised council funding, they will not get the tax reforms they have long campaigned for.Opposition parties said the Greens had always been likely to agree because of how it would look for Holyroodrsquos only pro-independence parties to fall out.Mr Mackay has also been under pressure to find a deal because the SNP has contrasted Holyrood stability with Brexit chaos at Westminster.A budget failure would also have undermined that message, as well as putting a dent in Mr Mackayrsquos leadership ambitions.Mr Harvie told the Herald: ldquoThe government has moved more than I thought they would this time last week. We are continuing to work hard in the final stages to reach an agreement that will protect local services.ldquoThe government know what they need to do. We will see where we get to.He also told ITV Border: ldquoWe are very hopeful that the Scottish government will give ground.

I urge all MSPs to unite behind the   Scottish Budget - that is what people theand breadth of Scotland expect.ldquoWe are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects, and I am confident others will approach things in the same spirit.Tory MSP Dean Lockhart said: ldquoRight across Scotland businesses are struggling to cope under an anti-business SNP government.ldquoDerek Mackay needs to stop the tax rises on people and firms, and set out pro-business plans to generate wealth, encourage investment and reward hard work.Labour urged all opposition parties to vote down the budget.If the Budget Bill is defeated today, the government would be able to table it again, with or without revisions, for another vote almost immediately.If there was a tie, the Presiding Officer would use his casting vote to continue the Bill.Final budget and income tax votes are due in mid-February."},{"url":null,"title":"rock-meets-gaelic-tradition-and-xbox-fantasy-in-celtic-connections-concert","story":"Yet on Thursday night, theyrsquoll take concert-goers into a world of fantasy, traditional music and live-action combat in a unique cross-over performance fusing traditional Scots music and Gaelic singing with interactive gaming.Simple Minds bass player Ged Grimes will lead a team of musicians and singers, including Deacon Blue guitarist Gregor Philp, in a one-off performance of the soundtrack from an American-made computer game set in th century Scotland.Players fight an evil force which has lain in wait for hundreds of years following mysterious events at Skara Brae, Orkneyrsquos famous neolithic settlement.The adventure is set against hours of Celtic music, scored exclusively for the game by Mr Grimes, working with a number of prominent musicians from Scotlandrsquos traditional scene.Mr Grimes, from Dundee, was approached by New Orleans-based game developers inXile Entertainment, having worked on soundtracks for games such as Earthworm Jim, Enter the Matrix and the Bourne Supremacy since the late s.Collaborating with musicians and singers from the Scots and Gaelic musical backgrounds, including -year old Peigi Barker, the voice of Young Merida in Disney film Brave, as well as -year-old Gaelic singer Rona Lightfoot, Mr Grimes was inspired by a visit to Japan to stage a live version of the music from the game featuring a full band and footage from the game.Tonight, his vision will be realised at Glasgowrsquos Royal Concert Hall as part of Celtic Connections.Mr Grimes said: ldquoYears ago I met Nobuo Uimatsu in Japan.

One thing Simple Minds have done, which I have total respect for, is that theyrsquove never rested on their laurels.ldquoWe did an acoustic tour a few years ago which tied in well with what I did on the games.ldquoBut this has opened up a world of incredible young Gaelic singers and musicians who are confident, multi-talented iniduals with a real pride in their culture and they want their culture and their language to be relevant and used.ldquoThe idea of that community being represented in an Xbox game is great. If someone in South America is playing the game then theyrsquore going to be hearing these songs and Gaelic music. It authenticates the game and it also gives those songs an international audience, and people might want to find out more about those songs and that language.ldquoItrsquos a bold and ambitious project which has over  people involved, but I just think sometimes people are looking for new experiences, said the musician, who was also an original member of s pop band Danny Wilson, best known for the  hit Maryrsquos Prayer.ldquoItrsquos a great thing for Gaelic and traditional Scots music to be in an Xbox game.

Or maybe it just does not seem fair to have a fight in which thousands, including a Cabinet Minister , line up against one -year-old.Mr Greerrsquos  minutes began last week after the Conservative Party sent a tweet to mark the anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill, who died in  at the age of .ldquoFor many, the party noted, ldquothe greatest Briton to have ever lived. Mr Greer reckoned this deserved a response, as stated previously, and lo there poured forth upon his head much outrage, the stickiest of it coming from Mr Morgan, the host of ITVrsquos Good Morning Britain.The Scottish Parliamentrsquos youngest MSP went on GMB to defend his view. Rather brave of him, I thought. No sign of the Scottish cringe in this one. He acquitted himself well enough, with an answer for every point put to him.As Piers went into full Tasmanian Devil mode, Mr Greer, getting his retaliation in first, accused him of being a snowflake. Cheeky. When the MSP called a comment Mr Morgan made ldquowildly ahistorical, the host clearly did not know what the word meant.It was such a drubbing for Piers that his co-host Susanna Reid had to step in and save the interview, telling the MSP: ldquoNo one is denying that every historical hero should be scrutinised, but the use of the language is so offensive.Cometh the woman, cometh the point. While it is reasonable to appeal for some perspective on Churchillrsquos career, Mr Greer could have chosen his words, and his medium, more carefully.Just as children are told that there are outdoor voices and indoor ones, so there is language you might use in, say, a student union bar, or among friends. His Twitter summary was brutal, over the top, and yes, designed to provoke a response.Such is the way points are made on social media. Twitter is no place for reasoned debate. Twitter is where nuance goes to die. The fact that so many politicians, from Mr Greer to the US President, see it as a primary vehicle for communication with the public, is deeply worrying, and indicative of these populist times.So much for what he said. What should not be in doubt is his right to say it. Nothing he tweeted was against the law. As for Piers Morgan telling Mr Greer thatldquoit wasnrsquot for Winston Churchill you would be speaking German and goose-stepping your way to Holyrood, it is a rum do to praise Churchillrsquos part in the fight for freedom at the same time as condemning someone for exercising their right to free speech.Even the most cursory look at Churchillrsquos history, pre-Second World War in particular, would find him a knotty, dficult character with a long, sometimes chequered career. He was a product of his era, his class, his prejudices. This was well known to people at the time.By the s Churchill was considered a busted flush. Then along came another world war. People could appreciate his blood, toil, tears and sweat because they had provided no little measure of these things themselves.While they valued the role Churchill had played, perhaps even thought him a military genius, they were not above seeing him in the round. By wars end they did not regard him as the man to lead them into the future. Hence Labourrsquos landslide victory at the polls in . That voters re-elected him in  is simply proof that times change and opinions with them.The further away we have come from the Second World War the more perspective on Churchill has been lost. There has grown up an almost infantile desire to portray him as a saintly figure who should never be criticised. No serious historian has taken such a tack, but others have. Take the  film, Darkest Hour. Won two Oscars Gary Oldman, brilliant. Fine movie, right up to the scene where Churchill takes a ride on the Tube and is urged by men and women of all classes and colours to stand up to Hitler, to fight, fight, fight and never surrender.From there, the audience is led to believe it was a straight journey to Churchillrsquos ldquofight them on the beaches speech. What a great story. Except it never happened. The filmrsquos director, Joe Wright, said the scenes were ldquoa fictionalisation of an emotional truth, a way to show that Churchill could read the mood of the British people better than his peers.The trouble with history is not, as one character said in Alan Bennettrsquos The History Boys, that it is ldquoone ******* thing after another. That is a statement of fact. The problem with history comes when we accept only one version of an event or person, usually from the victors side, as the truth and nothing but the truth.History is a deeply political, and politicised, pursuit. How it is told,it is even told in the first place, says much about the times and where power lies.How is it the case, for example, that I spent all my school years in Scotland yet was never taught a thing about my own countryrsquos history The American Civil War. The Peterloo Massacre. The Russian Revolution. All of this, but not a word about the Clearances, the Act of Union, anything to do with Scottish history. Anyone would think there was a conspiracy at work. Perhaps Mr Greer, given how keen he is on history, might like to look into that.Read more: Piers Morgan clashes with Ross Greer"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9179752.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotland-weather-coldest-night-of-2019-as-temperatures-dip-to-136c","story":"Loch Glascarnoch in the Highlandstook the top spot for chilly conditions and reached a low of -.C in the early hours of Thursday.The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for ice, snow and fog, which are set to remain in place throughout Thursday and Friday.#Cold this morning  Last night was the UKs and also all four of the home nations coldest night of the winter so far -. degC at Loch Glascarnoch was the lowest temperature recorded ### pic zycTcvjEZNorthern Ireland, Wales and Englandalso recorded their coldest night, withKatesbridge in Northern Ireland falling to minus .C, Sennybridge, Powys, dropping to minus .C, and Redesdale Camp, Northumberland, experiencing low temperatures of minus .C.The cold weather is not set to leave anytime soon - snow and ice is expected across much of Scotland on Thursday evening, with developing showers causingrain, sleet andsnowto fall on Friday morning.Read more:Scotland set for days of ice and snow as weather warnings issuedMotorists are warned to be cautious on the roads, as ice is likely to fall on untreated areas.The warning comes after a gritter overturned on Wednesday while on duty near Appin.The driver was taken to hospital after the vehicle crashed down an embankment at around .am."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee-graduate-recognised-as-rising-star-in-comics-industry","story":"Anna Morozova left her studies in November, where she graduated with MDes in Comics and Graphic Novels.She was commissioned by one of Britains most successful comics,  AD, to draw for Future Shock, a section dedicated to the best up-and-coming writers and artists.She has provided the art for a story entitled Juncture, written by Andi Ewington, which will appear in the comic later this year.Read more:Dundee le scientist working to eliminate disease knightedAnna said:\"Illustrating a story for  AD is an honour and I am very excited to join the list of creators who contributed to this legendary title.\"It is a fantastic professional starting point which was possible thanks to such a unique programme here in Dundee.\"I hope that the readers will enjoy my art on the pages of the forthcoming Future Shock.\"Finding the right style and approach was probably the most challenging part but I had a job to complete so I tried not to overthink the process.

While they might not appear an obvious concern, the height and movement of wind turbines can have a disruptive impact on aircraft.They can be detected on traditional radar screens, mimicking real aircraft so readily that they have to be avoided by other planes, and can distract air traffic controllers. As a result, the airport says, wind farms can have a detrimental impact on the safety, efficiency and capacity of its local airspace.But the airportrsquos new radar system, Terma SCANTER , mitigates this effect from turbines, and as a result will allow the development of the  turbine Kype Muir Wind Farm to go ahead near Strathaven, Lanarkshire. By law the airport must be consulted on any wind farm development plans within a  kilometre radius.Britainrsquos largest onshore windfarm, Whitelee, south of Glasgow is nearer to the airport, and while the airport has measures mitigate its impact, the equipment is limited and was installed nearly two decades ago.However a spokesman said the more advanced radar system could eliminate concerns about turbines, effectively ldquoremoving them from the air traffic control picture on an inidual basis. He said the airport must be sure that any proposed wind farm development did not pose a risk to the nine million-plus passengers using the airport every year, but the new system should allow it to support both Kype Muir and other future proposals.Glasgow Airport Managing Director Mark Johnston said: ldquoFor the last three years, the Airportrsquos planning team has been worked extremely hard to develop this wind turbine mitigation solution in what is a very complex and safety critical environment. As well as resolving the issue with Kype Muir, the mitigation may also have the potential to resolve issues with other future wind farm proposals.The development was welcomed by Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson who described it as ldquoa signicant development for aviation safety.Meanwhile Paul Beat, General Manager for air traffic control company NATS at Glasgow Airport, said: ldquoWersquore delighted to have worked with Glasgow Airport, Banks Renewables and TERMA to deliver a solution that both supports safe and efficient air traffic services, while also allowing this important wind farm development to be built.Glasgow was one of the first airports in the world to deploy large scale wind turbine mitigation in the form of infill radar, a spokesman said.As a result, it has approved % of the  wind turbine applications it received between October  and August .

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going. If it has to close for a number of weeks, it can make a real dference to their mobility and pain control.Retired GP Helen Charley, board chairman, said:ldquoHaving been a GP in Cromarty for  years, and having needed both hips and knees replaced, I am all too aware of how vital the Puffin Pool is to the good health and wellbeing of so many patients like me, she said.Established in  by Dr Malcolm Stevens, the pool has provided an average , sessions each year over the past four years.

Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4862285.1548404780!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond unique case is not unprecedented says advocate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.If challenged, the court’s answer will be considered in the context of the publicity around the allegations. To date no case in Scotland has been stopped because of prejudicial publicity and that’s despite there having been some high-profile cases that attracted considerable, sometimes extremely prejudicial, media attention.These cases were dferent in that the accused were not well-known public figures, but it was argued that publicity about the allegations could prejudice any trial.I wouldn’t call this case unprecedented, but it has its own unique aspects. However, the challenges for the court have been considered before. Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him. But that doesn’t matter – more to the point is whether it will be possible to find jurors that are untainted by prejudicial knowledge about the allegations.The Crown will say Contempt of Court rules apply and no-one can now publish anything that might prejudice the trial. There is now signicant protection in place and the media can only really report on procedural aspects such as the fact he has been charged.Very senior people at the Crown Office will be involved in decisions about possible proceedings once they have seen all statements and reports.

The deal with the Greens, which was confirmed less than an hour before finance secretary Derek Mackay addressed MSPs, also saw the SNP break a manesto pledge to cap council tax rises at  per cent. The agreement meant the £ billion Scottish budget was passed at stage one.Mr Mackay said: “These additional measures will deliver the most signicant empowerment of local authorities since devolution and provide additional funding to support local services.“This enhanced package offers up to £ million of increased funding and flexibility to councils, on top of the £.bn local government settlement. In total, overall spending power for local authorities next year will be £m higher than it is currently.”The deal will mean £m of additional cash for councils and the ability to raise £m more amid concerns over cuts in Mr Mackay’s original plans.: Insight into the frantic last-minute negotiationsCross-party talks are also to be staged by ministers with a view to replacing the council tax. If agreement can be reached, legislation will be published by  to bring about this change. However, any replacement would only be implemented after the next parliament in .The relaxation of the  per cent cap on council tax rises is a breach of a manesto pledge by the SNP to cap the rate at this level. It means bills can rise by a maximum of . per cent. In Edinburgh, this will mean the average band C property goes up by £, while band G properties rise by £. Councils will also be handed powers to introduce a new workplace parking levy, although this will not include hospitals and other NHS properties. Although the costs remain unclear, a similar scheme in Nottingham costs firms £ a yearthey have  spaces or more. It is up to the firms whether or not they pass the charge onto staff.As well as the plastic bag charge increase, ministers have also agreed “in principle” to a charging regime for disposable coffee cups.The tourist tax was immediately welcomed by Edinburgh Council leader Adam McVey, who immediately indicated the levy would be introduced in the capital.“I’ll keep speaking to industry to make sure we get this policy right,” he said.Councillors in Edinburgh will discuss the plans again next week. They have suggested a surcharge of £ on hotel rooms, which could raise £.m a year.The Scottish Tourism Alliance said the tax would “deliver a signicant blow to our industry”. The body said: “It will only serve to undermine the confidence that the thousands of tourism businesses operating across all sectors of the industry has had in the Scottish Government.”Andrew McRae, the Federation of Small Business’policy chair in Scotland, slammed yesterday’s deal.“We’ve seen concessions from the Cabinet secretary for finance that will erode the small business community’s trust in his administration,” he said. “Instead of Brexit help for firms, we see more tax changes, including a levy on our vital tourism industry. Ministers repeatedly promised firms that they would not pave the way for tourism taxes without industry support. They’re breaking that promise.”Town halls will also be handed control over rates relief on empty commercial properties, which would be another avenue to generate extra funds.Ministers have also pledged to set out three-year funding deals for local authorities in future so they are not left in the dark from year to year as they seek to plan spending.Gail Macgregor, resources spokeswomen with local government body Cosla, said the measures set out by the government were welcome recognition of the “essential services” councils deliver.“This helps councils across the country in making their tough choices,” she said.“Meaningful progress has been made on a number of fronts, including a commitment to secure more sustainable funding for local government going forward.”Councils had originally complained the budget plans set out by Mr Mackay in December would have meant £m of cuts to their “core budgets”.Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser said the deal left Scots facing a “triple tax bombshell”.He said: “We will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax will go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.”The SNP minority government needed the support of at least one other party to get its spending plans through. Labour had pledged to vote against the plans over the extent of the cuts to local councils, while the Tories and Liberal Democrats were both demanding a second referendum be taken off the table.It meant the Greens, who have combined with the SNP for the past two years to back the budget, were again Mr Mackay’s only serious hope of a deal.

We are sleepwalking towards a disaster and the Prime Minister needs to wake up and step up.“The advantages of remaining in the EU are growing, not diminishing. It’s time to end the nightmare that is Brexit.”After years of negotiations, the EPA was finalised in  and signed last July, creating the world’s largest bilateral free trade zone, covering  million people.It removes the majority of the one billion eurosof duties paid annually by EU companies exporting to Japan and eliminates a number of non-tarf barriers to trade.Japanese duties of .% on European cheeses, such as Cheddar, will be scrapped and the EU will be able to increase beef exports to Japan “substantially” and sell processed pork products duty-free, the European Commission said.The agreement also opens services markets in the areas of finance, e-commerce, telecommunications and transport and facilitates EU companies’ access to procurement markets in  large Japanese cities.In addition, the protection of geographical indication status will be extended to hundreds of speciality EU agricultural products for sale on the Japanese market.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the deal would “turbo-boost” trade and give customers in both markets greater choice and cheaper prices, while providing “gold standard” protections for workers and the environment.“Europe and Japan are sending a message to the world about the future of open and fair trade,” said Mr Juncker.“We are opening a new marketplace, home to  million people and almost a third of the world’s Gross Domestic Product, bringing the people of Europe and Japan closer together than ever before.”Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Downing Street on January  for talks in which Theresa May said both sides had expressed their hopes for an “ambitious bilateral arrangement, building on the deal already agreed between Japan and the EU”.Shuichi Akamatsu, minister for economic affairs at the Japanese Embassy in the UK, said: “We intend to steadily implement the EPA and further deepen the collaborative relationship between Japan and the EU.“With regard to Brexit, the Japanese government continues to urge both the UK and the EU to secure predictability and legal stability in the process of Brexit, and is watching with great interest in order that the impact on Japanese businesses, as well as the world economy, should be minimised.“When Prime Minister Abe visited the UK last month, he himself earnestly told Prime Minister May that Japan would like a no-deal Brexit to be avoided.“As reconfirmed during the bilateral meeting between the leaders of Japan and the UK, after the UK’s departure from the EU, Japan intends to build swtly on a new economic partnership with the UK using the Japan-EU EPA as a basis.”A Downing Street spokeswoman said “good progress” was being made on a number of trading arrangements to replace the free trade deals that will be lost when the UK leaves the EU.The spokeswoman said there were “strong elementswhich we think could be replicated in our own deal with Japan.”Japanese companies employ around , people in the UK and trade between the two countries totalled £ billion in the past year.Major employers such as Nissan and Honda, which invested in the UK as a gateway to the European market, have voiced concern about the potential impact of Brexit.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

was injured in the crash on the th of December – an incident which she says happened after she moved to avoid an oncoming car on the same side of the road.In the wake of the incident Sharon, from

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

The  album release ‘Up Among The Heather, The Scottish Album’, reflects the Scots influence on their Northern Irish roots - the album will be released on tour. Last year, their previous album ‘The Unicorn, the Continuing Story’ gave the long-awaited sequel to their famed Unicorn song.BRAID DATEBand leader, George Millar says: “In some ways it seems like yesterday, in other ways it seems a million years ago when I first met and played with Jimmy . “Neither of us had any idea what could possibly be ahead of us. Tohome and play after all these years, will be a highlight of our career and one we’re looking forward to immensely. Like the famous Bushmills Irish Whiskey, The Irish Rovers continue to improve with age and The Braid Arts Centre and Mid  East Antrim Borough Council are delighted that the boys are making a visit home to be applauded for all they have done over the years for the music industry, and for promoting this part of the world across North America and beyond. Thursday March  will see the Rovers will be performing at The Braid and they will be guests of honour at a reception where the Mid  East Antrim will welcome them home.AIR AMBULANCEAll proceeds from tickets will be donated by The Irish Rovers to the Mayors Charity Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.Another great honour for the band this year was being recognized as one of these islands greatest eacutemigreacutes by Ireland’s newest and most state of the art museum in Dublin, EPIC Ireland. Museum Director Mervyn Greene says: “The Irish Rovers are iconic, world class and with very a long career. “That’s important to us in Ireland. “They’ve truly taken Ireland with them and shown the world.As it happens, The Unicorn album is part of EPIC’s Irish Rovers installation. As young immigrants, the Rovers emigrated to Canada and became so much a part of the Canadian culture that Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau personally asked them to become full citizens so they could officially represent Canada around the world.In , The Irish Rovers had a breakout hit with their second album, The Unicorn.That album and the ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide.LAST MINUTE“The Unicorn, which was in fact a last minute add to the original album, left us all with a tear or two, plus the unanswered question, ‘Whatever happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore ” says George. Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

Squinter’s been running his eye over the top-performing personalities as we hurtle towards the ration book, conscription, petrol riots and raffling oranges. Jacob Rees Mogg’s rocky road to DublinArch remainer Lord Snooty has made a fortune from providing financial services through his company, Somerset Capital Management . Thoughhe will be luxuriously insulated from the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit evenhe never worked another day in his le, he is a leading light in the fanatically anti-EU European Research Group , which makes UKIP look like the Alliance Party and which sees a Brexit crash-out as pretty much an ideal scenario. But as the Brexit negotiations descended into chaos and then high comedy, SMG decided that it was time to open two new funds in, ah, Ireland. Although Jacob is a co-founder of the company and is paid £, a month for doing eight hours work a week for the company , he said the decision to set up business in Irelandwas nothing to do with him. Asthat’s not bad enough, the company’s prospectus for the coming financial identies among the key ‘risks’ facing the business in the coming financial year is ‘Brexit’. Simply spfing, old bean.Boris and his zig-zag BrexitBack in  when Boris Johnson was still considering what outcome in the Brexit referendum would be best for him – sorry, for the country – his close pal Sir Nicholas Soamestweeted this: “Whatever my great friend Boris decides to do I know that he is NOT an outer.” But regardless of where his heart and or his head is, Boris is certainly shoulder-to-shoulder with Jacob in the vanguard of the hard Brexit storm troops. ’Twas not always thus, truth to tell. Pre-referendum Boris famously came out for Brexit in his Dailycolumn. But what people didn’t know until some time later was that Boris had written two columns that week for the : one pro-Brexit and one pro-Remain. In the pro-Remain column, which was never published in the paper, he wrote: “Shut your eyes. Hold your breath. Think of Britain. Think of the rest of the EU. Think of the future. Think of the desire of your children and your grandchildren to live and work in other European countries to sell things there, to make friends and perhaps to find partners there.” Cue soaring violins. Boris’s most recent comment on the single market was that it is “useless” In  he said in Paris: “Personally, I would like to stay in the single market. We need to stay in the council of ministers of the internal market. In my view, the British have done good things for Europe.” Google Boris’s stunned reaction when the referendum vote was announced and then remember what Nick Soames tweeted.Nigel glad to be rid of the EU Former UKIP leader and Brexit poster boy Nigel Farage has two children by his German we, Kirsten Mehr. He has told journalists that both of them support England at the football, so that’s alright then. Except they both have German passports and so, thrillingly, unlike their English neighbours, will continue to enjoy free movement throughout the EU post-Brexit. And, of course, Nigel will continue to draw his £, per year EU pension – no-one hates the EU that much, not even our Nige. Squinter was particularly moved by Nigel’s claim in the weeks leading up to the referendum that staying in Europe would “spell the end of the steel industry in this country”. But Nige and his UKIP colleagues were in  among a tiny number of MEPs to vote against a move to tighten up rules on the import of cheap non-EU steel. Business, as they say, is business. The Man from the Daily MailFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre was the man responsible for all those headlines that frightened the horses during the referendum campaign and, subsequently, the attacks on Parliament and the judiciary as the political and legal implications were fought out. So he’s the Brexiter’s Brexiter. But it’s estimated that as a landowner Dacre benefited to the tune of around £, a year in EU subsidies. The veteran journalist was on over £m a year towards the end of his time with the Mail, so he’ll not be begging outside the Red Lion in his local villagethe UK leaves the EU. Brexit-voting and Mail-reading Farmer Browns, however, may be left sucking thoughtfully on a wheat stalk as they contemplate their own looming subsidy deficit, which may not be so lightly borne.Bordering on the ridiculousThe DUP’s singular focus as we hurtle towards Brexit D-Day is to block any deal that involves regulatory ergence with the mother ship – in other words: we must be treated exactly the same as Britain by the EU. Whether that’s a gentle wave goodbye with best wishes, or a massive, eye-watering boot in the ging-gangs matters not. We’re all in this together . The DUP’s insistence on alignment with the ‘mainland’ may be extremely touching, but it is an entirely new concept, for this little corner of empire long ago gave up any pretence of a claim to be as British as Finchley. Presumably, the party will continue to lobby for a dferent VAT and Passenger Duty regime post-Brexit, for they were white-hot on those ideas before the EU balloon went up. They’ll continue to block defamation law reform, keeping loyal Ulster as a magnet for libel tourists . Most famously, the DUP remains the bulwark against the equal marriage and abortion rights that are accorded to every other part of these two islands. Luckily, the party stood firm and insisted that Are Wee Country has to have exactly the same RHI regime as across the water, avoiding the possibility of widespread and catastrophically expensive abuse of the boiler scheme*Sub-editors: please check this last line for accuracy. Thanks, SquintPapers, pleaseAndrew Bridgen, Tory MP for West Leicestershireis another European Research Group charmer, without the profile of Jacob Rees Mogg but with the same level of warmth and likeability. Andy’s most notable brush with fame before Brexit thrust him into the public eye alongside Boris and Jacob was his posting of a raunchy video on a WhatsApp group composed of Tory MPs, some of them ministers. Suffice to say that the video included a scantily clad woman, a man and a sports car. A suitably repentant Andy explained to colleagues that it had been a terrible error caused by “fat fingers”. In October past he said in a radio interview that all English people are entitled to an Irish passport, a claim that nearly caused Twitter to explode and was the impetus for more jokes than Ian Paisley’s summer holidays.In response to a question on free movement between Britain and Ireland post-Brexit, Andy said: “As an English person, I do have the right to go over to Ireland and I believe that I can ask for a passport. Can’t I ” No, Andy, mate, you can’t. We’ve enough West Brits on this island, ta very much.Doctor Jekyll and Mr SnideThat Michael Gove’s a reasonable bloke, ain’t he  There he’s been for the past few months, urging cool heads and common sense, quietly and assiduously working to help Prime Minister Theresa may with a withdrawal agreement that’s harder to sell than a Northern Ireland shirt in O’Neills. While those nasty Brexit nutjobs in the ERG snarl and threaten, Michael’s been a model of loyalty and stf upper-lipped British discretion. But wait. Wasn’t it a bloke who looked exactly like him who said during the campaign that Turkey was about to join the EU, opening the gates to allow five million-plus Turks to come cascading into the UK.Yes, indeed: it was Michael Gove who made that claim. He has subsequently admitted that it was baloney and should not have been made. So them Turks stay in the mess they’re in. And so do we."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"attwood considers his future with sdlp","story":"THE SDLP’s Tim Attwood is considering his future within the party following the announcement of a newpartnership with Fianna Fáil.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin announced plans for an “historic” partnership between their parties in Belfast last Thursday. An SDLP conference is scheduled to take place on February  in Newry where the party membership is set to vote on the plans.Speaking exclusively to the Andersonstown News. West Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood said he was “not an advocate of the SDLP and Fianna Fáil partnership”. It’s known that South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna is also at odds with the party leadership over its move to link up with Fianna Fáil.“I recognise that the political landscape of this island has been changed utterly given the failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin to bring back the power-sharing Executive, the catastrophic consequences of Brexit and the emerging debate about Irish unity,” said Cllr Attwood.Cllr Attwood continued: “I have the greatest respect for the leadership of the SDLP and recognise that in a post-conflict situation there is a natural and wider debate about political realignment on this island,” he said. “The reality is my politics is steadfastly rooted in the social democratic and labour traditions embodied by the SDLP and parties of the Party of European Socialists.”Mr Attwood, who has served as a West Belfast councillor these past  years, said that over the coming days he would be speaking to his family and SDLP members in his constituency area about the proposal for a new partnership between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil. “I will make a further statement after these discussions,” he added.Meanwhile, SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney is supporting the party leadership in entering into a partnership with Fianna Fáil.Mr Catney said: “Northern Ireland is crying out for a response to the fast changing and signicant challenges across these islands as a result of Brexit. “Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, people here must be offered something new, credible and forward-looking in its approach.”The Lagan Valley MLA added: “Brexit has shted the political sands dramatically. It poses many challenges that sit outside the boundaries of local devolution. Our politics in the past two years, a politics of ision, of deadlock and of repetition is frighteningly at odds with the vast challenges that now face us. Old solutions to new challenges can no longer cut it.“It has always been the SDLP’s vision to unite our people. To seek an Ireland, befitting of the st century, where opportunity and prosperity are more than slogans on a placard but a way of le whether you are Catholic, Protestant or Dissenter. That will never change.“I am all too aware of the uneasiness some of my unionist neighbours may feel about this new partnership. Neighbours who have put their trust in me in countless elections. But let me be crystal clear a new Ireland, one without the full inclusivity of unionism is not one I want to be part of let alone build. You are part of the fabric of this island, woven into history every bit as much as any nationalist and you are a critical part of its future.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its good to talk media take note","story":"“You are trying to achieve Irish Unity by stealth.” The woman spoke accusingly.I was sitting in Dublin. In the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs’ building. It was a meeting to discuss women, peace and security. It was like being thrust back into the early s when words like Irish unity were considered “succour to terrorism”. In some ways I felt a little sorry for this  counties-born woman. She clearly had been influenced by the Section  RTÉ psyche and hasn’t kept up since the Good Friday Agreement. But maybe that’s patronising. Maybe she feels sorry for me.The accusation was made as I and my colleague explained how Irish citizens, particularly women, are having their rights denied to them in the north east of our country, and how under the terms of citizenship and responsibility in the Good Friday Agreement the Irish government need to step up and ensure they defend those citizens’ rights and not hide. The woman, who lives near the north-south border, is challenged by challenging self-imposed borders. It set the tone for the week.On Saturday, Queen’s University human rights Professor Colin Harvey, a very quietly spoken, humble inidual, took to the stage in the Waterfront at the first-of-its-kind nationalist conference. I was lucky enough to introduce him and take a seat next to him. The stage was shaking as he forcefully and loudly proclaimed: “We will not be seeking permission from anyone to talk about the unity of our country” “we apologise to no-one for being here today and having the conversation about the rights of Irish citizens.”Yep, it was that kind of week. The content of the Beyond Brexit conference, despite its wealth, was almost lost as the issue became about whether Irish citizens have the legitimate right to talk to each other about Irish unity or Brexit or both. Some unionists and media outlets felt that they should have a veto on how Irish nationalists will frame their own conversations. The manufactured ‘controversy’ was a modern-day version of those old laws which forbade Catholics congregating in numbers of more than five for fear they might engage in sedition. Indeed, the post-conference coverage has continued to focus on nationalists daring to hold such a professional well-attended conference as a spectacle, rather than these citizens raising issues that need to be engaged with.And of course, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have played the game too by telling us when it is appropriate to talk about a border poll. Their words would have far more meaningthey were calling on working groups in the Oireachtas to draw up policies and plans that might form part of a conversation on unity – like they did in addressing the referendum on the th Amendment, when they were actually trying to address violations of human rights and not just assuage them. Their tones of moderation feed the narrative that us northern nationalists are just too hot-headed or maybe even dangerous when we push at constitutional obligations. That feeds the concept of us being a people apart and tells us something about their complicity in the problem.I was reminded of the words of Parnell, written on his statue in Dublin:“No man has the right to say to his country, ‘Thus far shalt thou go and no further.’” "},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs nolan defends northern ireland is not in ireland comment if you want to bury your head in sand i cant do anything about that","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But when her former employer paid her wages into her bank account a day late, Orlagh claimed she couldnt access the £ December payment she was legally entitled to.Two months on - and currently thousands of pounds in debt - the -year-old from Dunmurry still hasnt received a penny and revealed that shes getting more and more desperate.\"Im living on money borrowed from my mother and my friends,\" she said. \"Its very stressful. Im trapped in this world now.\" Despite no longer being able to afford to eat or heat her home, Orlagh said shes been desperately trying to get other reception work, although the odds are stacked against her.\"Ive been sitting for days on end with no gas and empty cupboards,\" she said. \"Ive been for interviews but my confidence and self-esteem are gone. In my job, grooming and presentation are important youre expected to have your nails painted, your make-up on and no grey roots showing.\"I have no money to get my hair done. Im having trouble with a tooth, but I cant afford to see a dentist. Who is going to employ a toothless receptionist with grey roots \" She added: \"I havent kept my spirits up. Ive turned off people on social media to avoid upsetting myself over what theyre doing and what theyve got.\"The Department for Communities said that while it cannot comment on inidual cases, it is \"looking into the concerns raised in this case\".Orlagh said her money problems first began on August , , when her working tax credits stopped after her son Oisin turned  and left full-time education.\"That basically plunged me into financial chaos,\" she said.\"I was on a -hour contract at my previous job and when I asked my employer for at least  hours they couldnt offer me anything extra, so I had to leave.\"I was frantic. I was in real financial trouble so in a blind panic of desperation I left a job I really loved for another offering more hours.\"Prior to switching employers, Orlagh, whose only luxury is her television, said she really tried to make ends meet.\"From August  until October I lived on a part-time wagewith no benefit help and it wasnt enough - I was hungry,\" she said. \"Thats why I took a job offering more hours. But, after a one-month trial period, it didnt work out.\"With a monthly rent bill of £, and a weekly spend of £ on electricity and £ on gasand £ on work transport, Orlagh found that it all soon adds up.\"I dont have a mobile phone or extravagant expenses. I dont go on holiday,\" she said.The new job lasted from October  until November . When she phoned to claim Universal Credit the next day, she was initially told to register online.But she couldnt register online because she didnt have the right technology. Therefore, she physically had to visit the job centre and was told to expect a five-week wait for payment.\"I hadnt been paid since October, when I left the previous job, so by that stage I was in minus figures,\" she said.\"I was supposed to receive £ on January  for the month of December - and that includes my rent - but I didnt get anything because my last employer paid me a day late, on November .\"I have repeatedly explained that the wages paid into my account on November  represent earnings from October  to November , .\"But they refuse to accept this. According to their computer, those wages were earned between November  and December , . \"Therefore nothing can be done to help me.\"Orlagh raised a complaint on January . But, three weeks later, there is still no news and she is yet to receive a payment. Meanwhile, she revealed that her financial situation is likely to get even worse as she struggles to repay two government loans.\"There was no Universal Credit payment in December and goodness knows when Ill get something,\" she said.\"I wouldnt have a penny to my nameI hadnt borrowed around £ from the Social Fund to see me through. \"But because Im also paying back another Social Fund loan from a previous time, it means that £ a week will be taken out of my £ Universal Credit benefit when I finally get it.\"Orlagh said she was speaking out today to reduce the stigma of being poor because \"there are so many people out there who are pretending that everything is OK when its not\".She added: \"One catastrophic event after another has led me to this position.\"Im not a tracksuit-wearing person out on the streets whos never worked a day in her le. Once youre on minimum wage youre screwed youre nothing.\" The Department for Communities said statistics are not available to confirm how many local families rely on Universal Credit.In a statement it added: \"Current figures at January ,  show , live claims in respect of , claimants.\"The department also said there have only been  complaints since Universal Credit was introduced here in September .What the Department for Communities says... “Universal Credit is assessed on a monthly basis and is based on the claimant’s circumstances and earnings.

It was designed around British red lines,\" he said.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"However responding, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said delaying Brexit would not resolve the issues.

This is not just about Britains future.

We are all trying to work together here.\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next door to each other, we have an extraordinary history at times a very tragic history. But we have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"Mr Coveney said he did not believe the only reason for Theresa Mays crushing defeat in the Commons earlier this month was down to the backstop alone.\"If you look at the withdrawal agreement it is actually not that controversial. It is about protecting citizens rights.. about protecting British citizens rights in the EU .. its about a financial settlement.. its about creating the time and space for a transition period.. for preparing for new realities.\"And its about protecting a peace process which I believe the Prime Minister is deeply committed to.\"He added: \"The problem with the argument is that nobody has come up with a pragmatic, sensible and legally sound way of avoiding border infrastructure reemerging between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. And that is why it took two years to get the backstop agreed and that is why I believe the Prime Minister is correct when she defends it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dj marshmello teases concert in fortnite","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is situated at Belvedere Pl, Mountjoy, in Dublin which is a short five-minute walk to Temple Street Children’s University Hospital and close to other hospitals in the city.Whilst at Hugh’s House, parents are also able to share their own experiences which helps build an important support network at what is a very distressing time.‘Lesaver’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCllr Donnelly said the fundraising event at Creggan Community Collective on January  exceeded all expectations with people throughout the city supporting it.  The sponsored spin cycle covered  miles - the distance from Derry to Dublin.He commented: “We had a huge response, a lot of people took part in the cycle.  It was a km cycle and all sorts of people did shts, organisations, women’s groups and we well exceeded what we expected.“There is still some money coming in, UNISON just donated £ today and parent and toddler groups helped us out too.  When me and Paul Gallagher went down the Lord Mayor of Dublin was running afor Hugh’s House and there was another gentleman.  We were lucky enough that we met Ade and Martin who took us a tour around.“And whilst we were there we actually met two families from Letterkenny, but there have been a number of families from the council district who have been using it over the last while that we know of.”Speaking about local families who have availed of the service, he added: “I know a family who was supported by Hugh’s House in recent weeks, the mother was rushed to hospital in Dublin because there were no beds in the north.  The father was upset and they were stranded in the middle of Dublin with no contacts and had to find somewhere to sleep.“So it was through that that we phoned Hugh’s House and they were very helpful.  They then go through a social worker and visit the people in hospital, and they were lucky that two rooms had become available at the time.  The father was moved in and then when the mother got out of hospital she was able to use it as a base from which to visit the baby in hospital on a daily basis.“We talked to one of the families from Letterkenny who have three other children and, they said to us, ‘without this service we don’t know what we would have done.’  If you put yourself in that position, the hotels in Dublin are expensive, a child can be in for weeks, months or even a year in some cases then you couldn’t survive, people have bills to pay – it’s a lesaver for some people.”Photo: Cllr Paul Gallagher, Maria Kirby-BrennanAde Stack, Martin Curleyand Cllr Gary Donnelly."},{"url":null,"title":"newly acquired duncreggan road land may provide student parking solution","story":"The Ulster University Vice Chancellor has been urged to make available newly acquired lands at the old Foyle College for student parking in order to ease congestion in the Duncreggan area.SDLP MLA Mark H.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out.

These premises will be our new premises with dedicated areas for Lowden acoustic guitars and new electric guitar ranges, said George.ldquoWe are currently planning out the logistics of our move from Down Business Park. This will require attention to detail and be orchestrated stage by stage to minimise any disruption to our ability to complete and ship our guitars to waiting customers.Lowden Guitars successfully managed to keep news that it was working with Sheeran mdash one of the worldrsquos biggest music artist, who has sold  million albums and has had more than  billion streams mdash under wraps for considerable time.

But a starting price for a Lowden was three grand. When yoursquore , three grand may as well be a million pounds.ldquoThe dream of any kid who likes music is to have a guitar and the dream of any musician is to have a signature guitar.George realised that he needed to make a range that was something special and revealed that he sought inspiration from the North Coast.ldquoEvery guitar that I design and make I have to feel afterwards proud of it, I have to feel that I have achieved something with it. That itrsquos not just a normal guitar, he explained.ldquoThe main aim was to design and make a guitar here at an affordable price noticeably better than anything  at that price range. So I went up to the North Coast and spent a week at the Giants Causeway walking and thinking and drawing. Then having designed it, of course I sent it off to Ed and the rest is history.Sheeran has previously bemoaned that fewer youngsters seem to be interested in guitar-playing these days.ldquoThere are fewer guitar bands and fewer artists using guitars now, and not as many kids picking up guitars, he added.ldquoThat is something I would like to change by getting these great quality guitars, made in Ireland, into kidsrsquo hands and encouraging them to learn and progress.The Sheeran by Lowden acoustic guitar range features eight inidual models across two small body sizes familiar from the Lowden range, known as the S and the Wee Lowden.The guitars have been designed for uncompromising tone and playability and are made using sustainably-sourced wood including naturally fallen trees and reclaimed spruce.George says that the new range combines years of hand-crafting and traditional luthier methods with new construction technology.ldquoItrsquos taking everything I have learnt over the last  years, cherry-picking from that a few traditional methods of working by hand and introducing those into a whole series of new groundbreaking procedures for guitar making so that the end result is a guitar made in Ireland but one which really sings and which I hope inspires many young musicians and older ones as well, he added.The first orders should be shipped in March.

Will they have any heart to get the changes needed, or will they even have the ability  “They have already negotiated a failed and useless deal, so are they really going to be able to do any better now  Will they even want to “You need a change in the team to have a change in outcome. “Put it this way,you had a football team that had got hammered by the other side, would you send them back out again, or would you change your starting line-up the next time “In this case, the team we sent out last time didn’t even try to play.”A source close to the government said they understood that Mr Falconer is one name that has been mentioned by Number  as a potential addition to the negotiating team.The News Letter asked Downing Street to clary whether Mr Robbins would still be heading up the negotiating team, and whether Mr Falconer was being considered for the role.A spokesperson replied: “Oliver Robbins is still the lead civil service negotiator.

From its founder Ian Paisley being pictured with a sledgehammer and the slogan ‘smash Sinn Féin’ to deputy leader Peter Robinson leading an ‘invasion’ of the border town of Clontibret in the s to Ian Paisley Jr repeatedly shouting “moo, moo, moo” as a member of the Women’s Coalition spoke in the s, the DUP has always been far less concerned about the niceties of politics than most of its rivals.That willingness to act beyond the normal constraints of political discourse has been one of the secrets of the DUP’s ability to extract signicant concessions during negotiations - most obviously in  when the party secured a minimum of £ billion in new money for Northern Ireland in order to prop up Theresa May’s government.Even when in a weak position, the party believes that attack is the best form of defence.Over the last year there has been open DUP frustration – reaching a crescendo in December – at what it saw as Mrs May’s far less robust style of negotiation.But that simmering discontent has come to the fore over the last week as the DUP saw what it viewed as an open goal from the EU side.Last week – in what was the most dficult week for the otherwise watertight Dublin-Brussels relationship since the talks began – the European Commission’s chief spokesman said that in the event of a no deal Brexit it is “pretty obvious you will have a hard border” in Ireland.Dublin dismissed that argument, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stating that “even in a no deal, there will not be ato a border”.The very obvious question from the DUP was: If a hard border is not going to happen under any scenario – even a no-deal Brexit – why is the EU unprepared to move on the backstop, when it is supposedly there as an ‘insurance policy’ to prevent a hard border When asked that question, Tanaiste Simon Coveney has been evasive, something which will have heightened the DUP belief that it is a point of vulnerability for Dublin and Brussels.Last week also saw Michel Barnier state that “even in the absence of an agreement, we will do our utmost not to create a hard border in Ireland”, while the Polish foreign minister suggested that the backstop could be time-limited to five years, a proposal which is anathema to Dublin.The shambolic state of the British negotiation has to some extent obscured these problems for Ireland.Belfast murder victim’s family need answers, vigil told Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"On Tuesday, Sammy Wilson was quite open about the party’s desire, stating that “now is the time for the Prime Minister to exploit the chaos in Brussels and Dublin and press for a better deal”.Signicantly, that statement was endorsed by the party and released through its central press office rather than as a solo run by Mr Wilson.However, the DUP faces two dficulties of its own. While it is influential, the party is not in charge of the British side of the negotiations and the prime minister has done little to suggest that she has the appetite or aptitude for the DUP’s methods.And the UK is also facing a formidable negotiating partner, the EU, which is so far sticking to the sort of hard-nosed tactics followed by the DUP.try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However what we have with this announcement by npower is a kick in the teeth for the workforce, many of whom are GMB members.ldquoIt is only a few short years ago that npower offshored customer relations work and in the process closed sites in the North East and rationalised work around Rainton Bridge in Houghton-le-Spring.ldquoThe company then brought that work back into the UK when that strategic decision clearly had not worked.Sue Ferns of the Prospect Union said: ldquoNpower workers were already worried after the failure of the merger with SSE ndash todayrsquos announcement will be even more worrying for them, and for workers across the retail energy sector.ldquoThis is symptomatic of conditions in the sector and the Government and energy companies need to start taking action now to mitigate any further impact on jobs, and to minimise compulsory redundancies.Npower is part of the innogy SE group, and serves . million residential and business customers with electricity and gas..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Cost reductions at npower likely to affect around  jobs article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Conservative Party enjoysa confidence and supply deal with the Democratic Unionists which helps to prop up Theresa Mayrsquos minority government.Mr Rees-Mogg saidhe was at the dinner to support the Conservativesrsquo coalition partners.He said he has worked very closely with the DUP during the Brexit debate.ldquoThe DUP has very similar views on many issues relating to Brexit, he said.In terms of speaking at the event, Mr Rees-Mogg said those gathered have a ldquogreat deal to talk about in terms of Brexit.He also emphasised that he wants the UK to secure a deal with the EU before Brexit.He described the Malthouse Compromise, a proposal to extend the transition period for a year and protect EU citizensrsquo rights, instead of using the backstop, as the way to do that.Mr Rees-Mogg said it was the best way to satisfy both Leavers and Remainers.ldquoI think the Malthouse Compromise has received a good deal of interest and widespread support, itrsquos supported by the DUP, it is supported by many Conservatives from both the Leave and Remain points of view, and it seems to be something the Government is willing to run with, he said.ldquoI think there is a possibility of leaving with a sensible deal which is the preferred option for most people.ldquoIt is indeed my preferred option.Arriving separately, Mr Bankstold the Press Association that the DUP MPs had been very supportive of the campaign he was involved in for the UK to leave the EU, and said that he wanted to reciprocate that.ldquoI think the DUP have been fundamental,Brexit gets delivered, it will be because of the DUP, he said.Political donor Arron Banks was among guests at a DUP dinner in Ballymena on Thursday night. ldquoThey have got a lot of power over Theresa May and they have used that, so good on them.Mr Rees-Moggrsquos attendance at the event was questionedby the Northern Ireland Conservatives.NI Conservatives chairman Alan Dunlop described it as an ldquoodd alliance.ldquoBackbench MPs are free to speak to anyone they wish to, there is a clear convention within the Conservative Party however, not to speak in support of rival political parties, he told the Press Association.ldquoJacob Rees-Mogg is a highly respected member of the party with impeccable knowledge of UK constitutional politics and conventions and therefore will be fully aware of this.ldquoSadly on occasions, often in an honest defence of their principal political views, politicians find themselves making odd alliances and standing elements of their own political logic on its head.ldquoThey make themselves look foolish when they do so.Mr Rees Mogg is not the first Conservative MP to headline a DUP event, and is following in the footsteps of several high-profile representatives.

The Conservative Party enjoysa confidence and supply deal with the Democratic Unionists which helps to prop up Theresa Mayrsquos minority government.Mr Rees-Mogg saidhe was at the dinner to support the Conservativesrsquo coalition partners.He said he has worked very closely with the DUP during the Brexit debate.ldquoThe DUP has very similar views on many issues relating to Brexit, he said.In terms of speaking at the event, Mr Rees-Mogg said those gathered have a ldquogreat deal to talk about in terms of Brexit.He also emphasised that he wants the UK to secure a deal with the EU before Brexit.He described the Malthouse Compromise, a proposal to extend the transition period for a year and protect EU citizensrsquo rights, instead of using the backstop, as the way to do that.Mr Rees-Mogg said it was the best way to satisfy both Leavers and Remainers.ldquoI think the Malthouse Compromise has received a good deal of interest and widespread support, itrsquos supported by the DUP, it is supported by many Conservatives from both the Leave and Remain points of view, and it seems to be something the Government is willing to run with, he said.ldquoI think there is a possibility of leaving with a sensible deal which is the preferred option for most people.ldquoIt is indeed my preferred option.Arriving separately, Mr Bankstold the Press Association that the DUP MPs had been very supportive of the campaign he was involved in for the UK to leave the EU, and said that he wanted to reciprocate that.ldquoI think the DUP have been fundamental,Brexit gets delivered, it will be because of the DUP, he said.Political donor Arron Banks was among guests at a DUP dinner in Ballymena on Thursday night. ldquoThey have got a lot of power over Theresa May and they have used that, so good on them.Mr Rees-Moggrsquos attendance at the event was questionedby the Northern Ireland Conservatives.NI Conservatives chairman Alan Dunlop described it as an ldquoodd alliance.ldquoBackbench MPs are free to speak to anyone they wish to, there is a clear convention within the Conservative Party however, not to speak in support of rival political parties, he told the Press Association.ldquoJacob Rees-Mogg is a highly respected member of the party with impeccable knowledge of UK constitutional politics and conventions and therefore will be fully aware of this.ldquoSadly on occasions, often in an honest defence of their principal political views, politicians find themselves making odd alliances and standing elements of their own political logic on its head.ldquoThey make themselves look foolish when they do so.Mr Rees Mogg is not the first Conservative MP to headline a DUP event, and is following in the footsteps of several high-profile representatives.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
