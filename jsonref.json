By the time Meghan had become a senior royal, the pair were still no closer than before the 2018. According to one source, Meghan was disappointed that they hadn\u0027t bonded, but was not losing sleep over it.    The book also details one awkward moment at Kensington Palace in 2017 when Kate went alone in her Range Rover while shopping - despite  the fact Meghan was also going to the same street. Though some aides claimed the sisters-in-law \u0027talked and texted regularly\u0027, they had barely spent any time together by the time of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding.  The book also reveals how Meghan regarded some commentary and tabloid stories as \u0027sexist\u0027 and \u0027prejudiced\u0027, with ambitious women of colour like her labelled \u0027demanding and aggressive\u0027.  A close friend of Meghan\u0027s told the authors: \u0027Duchess Different. That\u0027s what people have a problem with.

It can take longer for these nerve cells to repair and regenerate.\u0027 Non-neuronal expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in the olfactory system suggests mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated anosmia | Science Advances"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27652585c1668abcf490e9182ff176eb1f2c422c/0_0_5184_3888/master/5184.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d41a4d0946978f6b3fc9ec2097e80737 1400w","title":"amazon plans big expansion of uk online grocery service","story":"Company seeks to capitalise on uplift in demand following Covid-19 lockdown restrictionsAmazon is stepping up its competition with British supermarkets by pressing ahead with the wider UK rollout of its online grocery service by the end of the year.Larger orders on Amazon Fresh will be free to members of the online retailer’s Prime service from Tuesday and will begin to cover more areas in the UK, as the $1.5tn (£1.2tn) company seeks to capitalise on the growth in doorstep deliveries during the coronavirus pandemic.Amid criticisms that the scheme amounts to a “postcode lottery” that many Prime members living outside London and the home counties have been unable to access, the e-commerce giant is also expanding the scheme to cover more areas of the UK and to allow greater take-up by its estimated 15 million members. Amazon Fresh is currently available in just 300 postcodes in and around London.It is understood that Prime members in Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh will be among the first to benefit from a wider rollout by the year end. Last month the Bradford-based supermarket chain Morrisons – which collaborates with Amazon on the US company’s same-day grocery service – said it had more than doubled the number of stores serving Amazon Prime customers to 40.Until now, Amazon Fresh purchases have required a monthly add-on fee of £3.99 or a £2.99 delivery fee (in addition to the annual Prime subscription fee of £79 annually). From Tuesday, orders worth more than £40 requiring two-hour delivery will be free but will cost £3.99 for a one-hour slot. Orders under £40 will cost £3.99 for two-hour delivery and £6.99 for one hour, however. The minimum order value will also be lowered from £40 to £15.In other changes, the service is also being speeded up, with same-day grocery deliveries up to midnight in, initially, more than 40 postcode districts in the south-east guaranteed, provided shoppers order by 9pm.“Prime members love the convenience of grocery delivery at home, which is why we’ve made Amazon Fresh a free benefit of Prime,” said Russell Jones, country manager, Amazon Fresh UK. “Grocery delivery is one of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon … We will keep improving the grocery shopping experience so by the end of the year, millions of Prime members across the UK will have access to fast, free delivery of groceries.”“They will certainly cause major disruption, ruffle feathers and capture a material slice of the market,” said retail expert Richard Hyman. “Amazon has deep pockets and the massive luxury of not needing to make a profit from food retailing. This is just as well because no one really makes much if any money from online food retailing now. A new kid in town with the immediate muscle of the others, and no need to make money, and the best data-driven logistics in retail has been the incumbents’ nightmare for some time, and it’s about to come true.” One analyst, however, warned that Amazon will have to overcome shoppers’ loyalty to established grocers. “This will not be an easy mountain to climb for Amazon, despite its financial and logistical prowess. Many UK shoppers have a much more emotional bond with food than non-food, and Amazon’s greatest challenge will be in presenting itself as a “go to” destination for food purchases,” said Tom Brereton, associate analyst at GlobalData.Ocado ZoomOnly available to a limited number of postcodes from a small site in west London (second planned for north London).

In recent months racism in some of the UK’s top institutions has come under scrutiny amid the worldwide protests following the killing of US citizen George Floyd and, in the UK, protests that led to the toppling of the statue of slave owner Edward Colston in Bristol.However, the report showed that many aspects of British life are still dominated by white leaders. There are no BAME chief constables in the UK’s police forces, only six BAME council leaders, one BAME trade union boss and no BAME permanent secretaries in the civil service.There were only two FTSE 100 chief executives from an ethnic minority and no BAME chief executives from the top UK financial institutions. At the UK’s top 61 law, accountancy and consultancy firms, only six chief executives or managing partners were from an ethnic minority.Trevor Phillips, Green Park’s chair and the former Equality and Human Rights Commission chair, highlighted that most of the rise was due to Boris Johnson appointing 10 ethnic minority government ministers. Phillips is leading a review into why BAME people have been disproportionately affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, although his appointment has been criticised after alleged Islamophobic comments.Raj Tulsiani, the chief executive of Green Park, said the report “demonstrates not only the disparity of power in the UK’s highest echelons, but also the total failure to address it despite three years of government-backed targets and ample institutional rhetoric about commitments to ersity and inclusion.”“Those in entrenched positions of power clearly need access to new perspectives.

The company’s statement said: “The continued use of the CJRS will be crucial in supporting jobs whilst demand recovers.”Whiteside said he would delay any decision on staffing “to the last possible moment so we get a better view”.“We want to give as much time as possible for demand to rise,” he said. “We employ people to serve customers... It’s a question of activity really.”The £65.2m loss compares with a £36.7m profit at the same point last year.Greggs shops were closed from 23 March until it started reopening 800 stores on 18 June. Total sales in the 26 weeks to 27 June were £300.6m, compared with £546.3m in the previous year.“The broad appeal of the brand, which is not materially dependent on office-based workers, means we are less impacted by social distancing than many,” Greggs said. “The majority of our shops are located in towns and suburbs, or catchments that are generally accessed by car. However, we still expect sales to remain below normal for as long as social distancing is required.”The pandemic has also changed Greggs’s expansion plans. The chain had planned to open more than 100 new stores this year, but now only plans 60 openings, with the focus on locations accessible by car, where sales have been more resilient, rather than those dependent on public transport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f1c01b30971e03e48338b55591ab4fa1e32be01/0_145_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0baa4385e62b347c9dbdfbf569af4f2","title":"how much is a life worth northern irish community split over gold mining plans","story":"There’s gold in the Sperrin mountains – £3bn, to be precise – but local residents fiercely oppose developers’ plansPeter McKenna remembers the trickle of visitors who started panning for gold in the Sperrin mountains of County Tyrone in the 1970s. “We put them in the same bracket as the leprechauns and the ringforts, end of the rainbow type stuff.”It turned out there really was gold. But an attempt to start mining in the 1980s faltered – the Troubles were raging and authorities feared the IRA would steal any explosives brought into this corner of Northern Ireland.Now, with the Troubles a memory, a New York-based investment fund is planning to build a mine at Greencastle, a hamlet in the Sperrin mountains that sits atop what is by grade one of the world’s biggest unexcavated gold deposits, worth an estimated £3bn.McKenna, a gold sceptic no more, is a community relations manager for the mining company Dalradian Gold, and instead of leprechauns he envisages licences, drilling and jobs. “This is something that has world potential.”Its fate hangs in the balance. The Stormont government announced on 29 June a public inquiry into the application, saying it had received more than 40,000 representations, the vast majority objections.The proposed site at Greencastle is just one of a slew of applications to mine gold in the Dalradian supergroup, a 450-mile belt of rock ning Ireland and Scotland.A surge in global prices – hovering at $1,800 an ounce as investors seek a haven from turbulent markets – may further whet the appetite for Celtic gold on both sides of the North Channel.Commercial extraction of ore at the UK’s only operational gold mine at Cononish near Tyndrum is to start later this year. Cononish is doing geological surveys at two other nearby sites and has exploration licences for 13 parts of the southern Highlands.A second firm, Erris Resources, has begun test sampling at two sites south of Loch Tay in Perthshire that it says have “good prospects” for gold, silver and zinc. Those licences cover hundreds of square kilometres.Other companies have obtained gold prospecting licences for several counties in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, including a site in Clontibret, county Monaghan, said to hold about 500,000 ounces. It is 40 miles south of Greencastle.The Dalradian supergroup was becoming famous for untapped gold, said Richard Gray, the managing director of Scotgold Resources, which owns Cononish. “In the parlance of geologists, it’s elephant country.”The geological formation is named after the Dál Riata, a Gaelic kingdom credited with a golden age of influence in the sixth century. The prospect of mining companies ushering in a literal golden age has polarised opinion in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some welcome the promise of jobs and investment. Others, including conservationists and environmentalists, fear pollution and despoliation.Politicians and regulators face intense lobbying from both sides. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) is drafting its first mining and quarrying strategy which will cover the water and environmental pollution laws gold mines need to uphold.“We’re clear that environmental compliance is non-negotiable. Every Scottish business will comply with the law, and we’ll work to ensure as many as possible will go even further,” said Kenny Boag, Sepa’s head of strategic regulatory initiatives.Northern Ireland’s infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, said a public inquiry would “robustly scrutinise” the proposed mine at Greencastle.Battle lines have formed for the greatest prize in the Dalradian supergroup. On one side stands Orion Resource Partners, a US investment fund that owns Dalradian Resources, the Canadian parent company of Dalradian Gold.After spending £130m exploring the site it submitted an application for a mine and processing plant in 2017, later revising the application when it dropped plans to use cyanide. The company posits hundreds of jobs, a £750m lift to Northern Ireland’s economy – and clean practices to protect a designated area of outstanding natural beauty.“We’re a first world country with first world standards,” said McKenna. To extract an estimated 3.5m ounces of gold the mine would remove about 1,500 tonnes of rock per day and return about half of it, backfilling tunnels. “Compared internationally it’s a baby, engineers call it a boutique mine,” said McKenna.On the other side stands a group of residents who doubt the promised jobs and fear contamination of air, land and water. They staff the Greencastle People’s Office, a clutch of caravans near the proposed mine which serves as a command centre.“First they’ll blast with explosives and that’ll just be the start. It would wipe out this whole area, it would be toxic,” said John O’Donnell, who fishes trout in rivers.Martin Tracey, 46, a farmer, said damaging dust particles could reach schools and homes close to the site. “If that lodges in the lungs it doesn’t come out again. How much is a human life worth? It’s like someone coming into your house and attacking your family.”The protesters accuse Northern Ireland’s main political parties of ignoring them and question the independence of an inquiry that will sit before the planning appeals commission.The proposed mine has ided the community and sundered friendships, with each side accusing the other of surveillance and intimidation.Instead of gold, the mine may excavate a history of resistance to outsiders that dates back centuries, said Tracey. “We’re well prepared to fight these guys. The pedigree is there. I’m not going to lie down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1452d1a2f6bde8d99fb8759444ff976924f1f6f0/0_257_3009_1807/master/3009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e971195103ad7c3d1bc407554aaad98","title":"ousted renault boss thierry bollore appointed new head of jaguar land rover","story":"Frenchman Thierry Bolloré to help steer UK’s biggest carmaker through industry’s worst crisis for decadesThe former boss of French car giant Renault has been appointed as chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s biggest carmaker.Thierry Bolloré, who said he was the subject of a “strong-arm coup” when he was ousted as Renault chief executive in October 2019, will take over from Sir Ralf Speth as JLR’s CEO in September.Bolloré, 57, will be tasked with guiding JLR through the car industry’s worst crisis in living memory as consumer demand for new cars plummeted amid the global economic crisis prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the chairman of India’s Tata conglomerate, which owns JLR, said: “I am delighted to welcome Thierry to Jaguar Land Rover. An established global business leader with a proven track record of implementing complex transformations, Thierry will bring a wealth of experience to one of the most revered positions in the industry.”Bolloré said: “Jaguar Land Rover is known around the world for its peerless brand heritage, exquisite design and deep engineering integrity.

I couldn’t be more excited to join the team continuing to shape the future of this iconic company.”Bolloré was ousted from Renault after less than a year in the top job as the French carmaker sought “a breath of fresh air” following the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, its former boss, in a huge financial scandal in Japan. Ghosn presided over the global alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi.At the time of his ousting in October, Bolloré, once a close associate of Carlos Ghosn, told the French business paper Les Echos that the “brutality and the totally unexpected nature of what is happening are staggering”.“Operationally, I do not see where the fault is,” he said. “This coup is very worrying”.Speth, 64, who has been CEO of JLR for a decade, will become non-executive vice chairman.Chandrasekaran said: “I want to thank Ralf for a decade of outstanding vision and leadership for Jaguar Land Rover and welcome him to his new non-executive position in addition to his existing role on the board of Tata Sons.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25c7ca916b9d4bf4db45ad90622919b2d906ff9/0_134_4602_2761/master/4602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e42924ba6cb883653421f59613490c3a","title":"gold eases from new 1980 record as dollar lifts ahead of fed covid 19 business live","story":"I’m on a call hosted by the International Air Transport Association, which represents the global airline industry.HSBC’s move comes after the recent Black Lives Matter protests in the United States and around the world.

It has also said it will work with headhunters to “engage” black and ethnically erse candidates for leadership roles and improve their representation on shortlists in mid-career roles. It will also update its recruitment processes to reduce potential bias and “enhance” hiring strategies for its graduate programmes.The planned closure of the furlough seems to be a mistake, motivated by an understandable desire to limit spending. The scheme was intended by the chancellor to be a bridge through the crisis and there is a risk that it is coming to an end prematurely and this increases the probability of economic scarring.” The scheme has been an undeniable success in terms of keeping furloughed employees attached to their jobs. The incentives offered to employers by the Job Retention Bonus look too small to be effective given the uncertainty about the economic outlook ─ a one-off payment of £1,000 per employee compared to an average wage of £530 per week.Barry Naisbitt, Associate Research Director for Global Macroeconomics at NIESR, says:While the economic policy responses have been swift, they have not been coordinated. It is not obvious that policies to unlock economies will be coordinated either. Given the risk of a second wave of the virus and of long-term economic scarring, there is a compelling case for international policy coordination to ensure that public health is restored and that the benefits of a global economic recovery are widely shared.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a UK think tank, has published its latest UK and global forecasts. Even with such an increase, however, the level of GDP at the end of 2021 will be lower than had the pandemic not occurred.Returning to the CBI retail sales survey, Andy Bruce, economics reporter at Reuters, has summed it up nicely:Staying with retailers... Selfridges is to cut 450 jobs across its department stores, in the latest blow to UK high street retailers hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, it emerged today.The move follows 700 job losses at upmarket rival Harrods which were announced earlier this month. At the time the Harrods chief executive, Michael Ward, blamed the cuts on social distancing and a lack of tourists visiting the UK.Greggs, famous for its traditional and vegan sausage rolls, was more upbeat, despite posting a £65m half-year loss. Here is our full story: The CBI surveyed 62 retail chains, as well as 55 wholesalers and 16 car retailers. Wholesalers reported the fourth consecutive month of falling sales and orders, though at a slower pace than last month. Both sales and orders are expected to worsen again next month.The CBI survey showed that shoppers bought more food and drink this month, but sales of hardware and DIY products and other things such as cards, flowers and stationery also returned to growth. Although most other retailers – for example clothing, footwear and department stores – continued to report significant declines, in some cases falls were less severe than in recent months.Here are the CBI’s main findings for retailers:NEWSFLASH: UK retail sales rose in July to its highest level in over a year, mainly because of higher grocery sales, according to a survey. Non-esssential shops were allowed to reopen from 15 June after being closed for months, since the government imposed a Covid-19 lockdown on 23 March.The measure is a balance of those who are reporting higher sales minus those whose sales have fallen. For August, retailers are expecting a weaker performance. It’s great to see retail sales stabilise this month, but this doesn’t tell the whole story. This crisis has created winners and losers within the retail sector and for some businesses the picture remains bleak.The re-opening of non-essential retail was a vital step towards recovery but isn’t a cure-all. The government has provided critical support for firms and jobs throughout the crisis. But ongoing financial pressures are a major challenge for some retailers, and additional direct support to shore up cash flow, such as extension of business rates relief, should be considered.European banks are being urged to preserve their cash for longer, amid fears that the coronavirus crisis could drag on for the rest of the year, reports our banking correspondent Kalyeena Makortoff.The European Central Bank, which previously told banks to halt idend payments and share buybacks until at least October, said this morning that lenders should extend that restraint until 1 January 2021. It has also told CEOs to be “extremely moderate” with staff bonuses, consider how much variable pay could be cut or how long payment could be delayed. The ECB said banks should not try to compensate staff for those losses in other ways, and warned that the regulator would be monitoring pay levels. The ECB said recent analysis showed that bank capital levels “could decline significantly” in a “severe” scenario.“This updated recommendation on idend distributions remains temporary and exceptional and is aimed at preserving banks’ capacity to absorb losses and support the economy in this environment of exceptional uncertainty. “This uncertainty makes it difficult for banks to accurately forecast their capital positions.”The central bank pledged to review its stance in the fourth quarter, taking into account the economic environment, stability of the financial system and reliability of capital planning. The Bank of England, which already pushed banks to scrap payments for the entirety of 2020, said it would also carry out a review of its own policies in Q4. Aside from the proposed US stimulus package, hopes of some progress in efforts to find a Covid-19 vaccine have also added to the more buoyant mood in stock markets today.Moderna, a Boston-based biotech firm, has just begun its first late-stage trial of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine, giving the first doses to participants in what will be a 30,000-person trial, it announced yesterday. It is conducting the trial in partnership with the US National Institutes of Health.Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech also announced they were starting a late-stage trial of their vaccine.Josh Mahony at IG says:As Moderna heads into the third phase of their vaccine trial, it does feel as if we are entering the final stretch of a historic push for a solution to this pandemic. While markets have been burnt by heavily manipulated announcements from pharma firms working on treatments and vaccines, the fact is that we have multiple routes to success, as Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Moderna all push to get their vaccines across the line. The big question for the short-term is whether the likes of the UK and US will be willing and able to extend much of the financial support provided throughout this crisis, with a failure to do so likely to spark a huge spike in unemployment as a result. Housebuilders are leading gains in the London stock market today, with investors piling into a sector that tends to benefit in post-crisis periods. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at online trading platform IG, says:With the recent stamp duty holiday expected to spark a resurgence in demand, speculation over the potential measures such as a help-to-buy extension adds yet another string to the bulls bow. Fears surrounding a potential spike in bankruptcies and job losses remain an issue for banks, yet the housing sector still has the opportunity to enjoy a particularly strong period as previously hesitant movers finally take the plunge thanks to government incentives. Alongside the stamp duty holiday, Johnson’s promise to relax planning restrictions for new builds, and invest £12bn in 180,000 affordable homes goes to highlight the boom that could be ahead for the sector. But the stamp duty cut has only really benefited wealthier buyers in London, says the property website Zoopla. The tax, which is paid by homebuyers, was temporarily removed on properties up to £500,000 in England and Northern Ireland by Rishi Sunak as the centrepiece of his summer financial statement this month.Designed to boost housing transactions and demand for goods and services related to moving home – such as estate agents, solicitors, removals and the building trade – the tax holiday is set to last until 31 March 2021, at a cost to the exchequer of £3.8bn.In its monthly assessment of house prices and property sales, Zoopla said the change had less of an impact on regional housing markets than in London. “This boost to transaction volumes has not been replicated in other regions, where average property prices are lower and less responsive to stamp duty amends,” the property website said.Over in Japan, Nissan has forecast its biggest-ever annual operating loss in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

By swimming upstream, they transport nutrients from the oceans and provide food for many land animals, including bears, wolves and birds of prey.The migratory fish are also critical for the food security and livelihoods of millions of people around the world, while recreational fishing is worth billions of dollars a year. The causes of the decline are the hundreds of thousands of dams around the world, overfishing, the climate crisis and water pollution.“For migratory fish, there’s nothing worse than a dam,” said Zeb Hogan, at the University of Nevada and an author of the new report. He said the good news was that fish could return quickly: “Almost without exception, where dams have been removed, you see populations bounce back, often much more quickly than anyone anticipated.”A river restoration completed by the Penobscot River Restoration Trust partners in 2016 on the Penobscot River in Maine, US, led to river herring numbers growing from a few hundred to nearly 2m a year. The Dam Removal Europe coalition is working to free the continent’s rivers from more than 100,000 obsolete barriers. But thousands of hydropower dams are being built in other parts of the world.“Catastrophic losses in migratory fish populations show we cannot continue destroying our rivers,” said Arjan Berkhuysen, at the World Fish Migration Foundation. “This has immense consequences for people and nature across the globe. We can and need to act now before these keystone species are lost for good.”She said migratory fish were often the driving force in food chains because they transport nutrients: “If these fish populations continue to decline, there will be far-reaching consequences for many species which rely on them.”The report, led by Stefanie Deinet at the Zoological Society of London, examined data from 1,406 populations of 247 species. There are 1,100 species that must migrate to survive. The researchers said much more data was needed for regions outside Europe and North America to go beyond the general trends presented in the report.Migratory fish often use water temperature as a cue to start their journeys, but dams can significantly lower the temperature of river water. Global heating is also a factor, and can also change rainfall patterns. “So you get these very unnatural flows that can really have an impact on migratory fish,” said Hogan.“Not all dams are created equal,” he added. “Some dams are more environmentally damaging than others and how you place, design and operate them is important.” The damage to ecosystems and livelihoods must be taken more into account when building new dams, he said.Stephanie Januchowski-Hartley, at Swansea University, UK, said the millions of small obstructions to rivers, such as road culverts, also needed to be considered: “The cumulative effects of those are potentially greater than that of larger infrastructure, because of sheer numbers in the waterscape.”“We know why we’re losing these fish and we know what to do to save or restore them,” Hogan said. “It’s now a matter of public awareness and public will.” Stuart Orr, at WWF, said: “The world needs to implement an emergency recovery plan for the benefit of people and nature.”• This article was amended on 28 July 2020.

Nuclear fusion promises clean, unlimited power but, despite 60 years of research, it has yet to overcome the technical challenges of harnessing such extreme amounts of energy.Millions of components will be used to assemble the giant reactor, which will weigh 23,000 tonnes and the project is the most complex engineering endeavour in history. Almost 3,000 tonnes of superconducting magnets, some heavier than a jumbo jet, will be connected by 200km of superconducting cables, all kept at -269C by the world’s largest cryogenic plant.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, launched the assembly phase, alongside senior figures from Iter members, the EU, UK, China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the US. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, said: “I believe disruptive innovation will play a key role in addressing global issues including climate change and realising a sustainable carbon-free society.”“Enabling the exclusive use of clean energy will be a miracle for our planet,” said Bernard Bigot, Iter director-general. He said fusion, alongside renewable energy, would allow transport, buildings and industry to run on electricity.Nuclear fusion releases vast amounts of energy when heavy hydrogen atoms fuse together, but this requires a temperature of 150m C, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. The hydrogen fuel is obtained from seawater and just a few grammes is needed but huge magnets are needed to contain the plasma in doughnut-shaped vacuum chamber known as a tokamak.Like conventional nuclear fission reactors, the process itself does not produce climate-warming carbon dioxide but fusion reactors cannot meltdown and produce much less radioactive waste.The Iter project will be the first to achieve a “burning” or self-heating plasma and is expected to generate 10 times more heat than is put in, far more than any previous attempt. It will also use a significant amount of electrical energy when it is running, to power the magnets and scientific instruments, But it is intended to be a proof-of-concept of large-scale fusion, not a design for a future commercial reactor.Among the components being assembled is the 30-metre-diameter cryostat, manufactured by India, which surrounds the reactor and keeps it at the extremely low temperature required. One of the electromagnets, called the central solenoid and built by the US, will have the magnetic power to lift an aircraft carrier.There are numerous private-sector companies pursuing nuclear fusion via much smaller devices, including Tokamak Energy, based in the UK and which has raised £117m in investment. Its executive vice-chairman, David Kingham, said: “We welcome the progress at Iter which we see as a great scientific project and a major endorsement of tokamak devices.”“But we are convinced that faster progress is possible, driven by the need for more carbon-free energy and enabled by private investment, modular designs, new materials and advanced technologies,” he said. Iter engineers said their giant project is the size that proven technologies can deliver.Other nuclear fusion companies include Tri Alpha Energy, which harnesses particle accelerator technology and is working with Google, General Fusion, which uses a vortex of molten lead and lithium to contain the plasma and is backed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and First Light Fusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79eb10e9f989a5120f7955da24796c64e766ed6d/0_137_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=324aa89170baed813653712d7d75c071","title":"caught in the act camera traps snare rarest species in pictures","story":"Snow leopards, tapirs, oriental storks and many others feature in WWF’s new collection.

But there was a problem. Yaya Touré was on the verge of joining, but wanted to make sure City signed David Silva first. The Valencia man’s response? “Sign Yaya first, I will come.”They both did and the rest – at least, as of Sunday evening – is history. As Silva took his leave from the Etihad Stadium pitch after his final appearance in English football, the absence of a crowd barely detracted from the warmth of his reception: not just the affection of his teammates and coaches, but weeks and months of tributes and superlatives from the wider game.Running through all these tributes were a few common themes. Genius. Magic. Humility. Sophistication. Joy. “City’s first world-class player in my lifetime,” said Gary Neville on Sky Sports. “City’s finest ever player,” was Jamie Carragher’s verdict. Elsewhere, we heard even more lavish claims: bracketing him with Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo or Eric Cantona as one of English football’s greatest foreign players. Or with Frank Lampard, Ryan Giggs and Steven Gerrard in a discussion of the Premier League’s greatest midfielders.The point of this column is not to quibble with the immense and immeasurable brilliance of Silva – which would be stupid – but to point out the curious absence in many of the above discussions. Greatest City player, greatest Premier League midfielder, greatest foreign import: where, pray, is Touré’s name in all of this? Well, as of last week, he was training at Leyton Orient. Still going at 37, and stuck in London during lockdown, Touré contacted the League Two club with a view to building up some fitness while plotting his next move.In the week that Silva departed English football with praise ringing in his ears, the marginalisation of Touré feels even more poignant: the sense that while Silva’s legacy is secure, Touré’s is still being negotiated.At City, they need little convincing of his impact. There’s a pitch at the training ground bearing his name, a mural immortalising his feats. Even so, occasionally you wonder exactly what is being remembered. Often City fans will describe Touré as a great match-winner, drawing a fine line between technical ability and competitive instinct. Joleon Lescott makes the same distinction in describing Silva as “the best footballer” of City’s modern era, and Touré as “the best player”.Able to play every position from central defence to No 10, able to pile up goals, assists, dribbles, passes and tackles with the same relentless ambition, able to dominate a game in virtually any way he chose. He could sit deep and orchestrate, barrel through the centre, kill you with a free-kick. He could snuff out a game or bend it to his will, run it with breathtaking vision or one of the most sophisticated first touches around.More than that, he loved City to his bones. He did more than anyone to elevate the club’s stature and mentality, shed their inferiority complex, turn them into serial winners. Yet nobody describes Touré as a genius or a magician, pays tribute to his humility or sophistication. Why might this be? Partly, this is about how we remember footballers. The stories we tell about them. How we condense the thousands of things they have done on into a tidy, bitesize package. Silva: a wizard, a model professional, a club stalwart for a decade. Touré: a catchy chant, a birthday cake, some unforgettable moments and an acrimonious departure.Clearly, there has been a racial element to some of his treatment: not just the overt abuse he received while playing in Ukraine but the later accusations of physical decline (fair), laziness (unfair) and avarice (what would have been a reasonable wage for a first-choice Barcelona midfielder in the summer of 2010?).Perhaps, too, Touré has suffered from timing. His career-defining season in 2013-14 under Manuel Pellegrini coincided with the least-cherished of City’s four title wins. He was arguably never quite the same player after the death of his brother Ibrahim in 2014. Having taken a circuitous route to the top, his route down – Olympiakos, the Chinese second ision, an aborted move to Botafogo – feels similarly unsatisfactory, a waning rather than a dying of the light.Yet it is high time for a reassessment. The departure of Silva breaks one of the last surviving links with that first great City team under Roberto Mancini (Sergio Agüero is still elegantly ploughing on). Posterity and hindsight may offer a fairer reading of that side: not simply an expensively assembled star factory that got wildly lucky at the end, but a prototype for the meticulous winning machines that followed it. Silva, finally, has his due.You only hope that in time Touré will get his."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a806b3f9bf86a39de4a102b321a4a4a0c6890845/672_863_6263_3760/master/6263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f03bf90b197c39020f65a8f36fb9b7b1","title":"soap dodger meet the doctor who says we have been showering wrong","story":"Hand-washing aside, James Hamblin has not used soap for five years. He warns that our obsession with being clean is harming the microbiome that keeps us healthyWhen James Hamblin tells people he has not used soap in the shower for five years, they tend not to hold back in expressing their disgust. “It’s one of the few remaining things for which we feel fine telling someone that they’re gross,” he says. “It’s amazing to me, honestly.”Yet despite people’s “clearly moralising judgments”, Hamblin is no hygiene slouch. Even pre-pandemic, he made a point of washing his hands with soap. He is, after all, a doctor who lectures at the Yale School of Public Health and a medical writer and podcaster for the US magazine the Atlantic. At 37, he looks so youthful that he still gets compared to the fictional child doctor Doogie Howser.But eschewing soap on your pits and bits does raise awkward technical questions, more on which after some context. Hamblin’s minimalist showering habits evolved gradually, after he relocated from California to a studio apartment in Brooklyn, New York, to pursue a writing career. He needed to save time, money and space. Simultaneously, he says: “I started learning about emerging microbiome science and decided to try going all-out for a bit.”Even if you have not yet read up on our microbiomes – the trillions of microbes that lead symbiotic lives with humans, colonising our skin and our guts – you may have spotted vague statements such as “microbiome-gentle” printed on bottles of shower gel. This because microbiologists – and brands – are learning more and more about the complex relationship we have with our germs. These include their starring roles in developing our immune systems, protecting us from pathogens (by creating antimicrobial substances and competing with them for space and resources) and lessening the likelihood of autoimmune conditions such as eczema. So, there is a growing awareness that scrubbing them off, along with the natural oils on which they feed, or dousing them with antibacterial products may not be the best idea after all.Hamblin’s new regime got him thinking about modern notions of cleanliness, what is natural and how these two issues are, frankly, all over the shop. Stigmatism of body odour began as an advertising strategy that helped quadruple the sales of Lifebuoy soap in the 20s. A century later, we still live in fear of anyone detecting the slightest hint of BO on us. We are more perfumed, moisturised and exfoliated than ever.Yet despite advances in skincare and modern medicine, conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis, as well as other autoimmune diseases, have been rising steadily. Also, while we attempt to appear squeaky clean, research has revealed that many of us don’t wash our hands properly – or at all – when it matters most: before eating and after going to the toilet. (That said, awareness of the importance of handwashing has certainly risen as a result of Covid-19.)“It’s all mixed up right now, right?” says Hamblin, who set out to explore these paradoxes in perceived cleanliness in his book Clean: The New Science of Skin and the Beauty of Doing Less. He says the key to the success of his experiments, which saw him all but give up deodorant, was his “slow-fade” approach. “As I gradually used less and less, I started to need less and less,” he writes. “My skin slowly became less oily, and I got fewer patches of eczema. I didn’t smell like pine trees or lavender, but I also didn’t smell like the oniony body odour that I used to get when my armpits, used to being plastered with deodorant, suddenly went a day without it.” As his girlfriend put it, he smelled “like a person”.It is not that we were unaware of bodily odours before “BO” was coined, but Hamblin thinks our natural smells are far more nuanced and informative than we give them credit for. “We know from historical writings that certainly people smelled bad. We didn’t just accept all smells,” he says. “Now, if someone smells sweaty or of anything less than soap, perfume or cologne, we think of that as being unclean.”Hamblin started to notice that he smelled less pleasant when stressed. He interviewed a researcher who could train dogs to sniff out cancer in humans, while lovers he spoke to told him they thought the way their partner smelled naturally was good. He writes: “The hundreds of subtle volatile chemical signals we emit may play roles in communicating with other people (and other species) in ways we’re just beginning to understand.”Hamblin also highlights the bare-faced cheek behind the rise of the skincare industry, as soap progressed from a multipurpose, often homemade product to a seemingly infinite parade of near-identical concoctions advertised for different problems, genders and occasions, at wildly different prices. Once hooked on daily soapings that remove our natural oils, we needed moisturisers and hair conditioners to replace them. In the 50s, the industry further cashed in by highlighting the drying effects of soap and offering milder detergents. Today, Hamblin writes, we have come full circle many people seek products that are “as close as possible to nothing at all”.He writes about a fellow journalist – and soap dodger – Maya Dusenbery, who had been prescribed every acne treatment going. The only one that worked? Nothing at all.She had tried astringents, to dry out the skin oral and topical antibiotics the pill and isotretinoin, a drug that has been linked to side-effects such as suicidal thoughts and inflammatory bowel disease. Not only were these ineffective, but she also developed rheumatoid arthritis – an agonising autoimmune condition. When she started taking immune-suppressing medication for that, her hair started falling out. Enough was enough: Dusenbery stopped taking any medication for her skin. After an extremely oily few months, it settled. Now, the only things that touch her face are a microfibre cloth and water. Thanks to her adoption of a more holistic approach to her rheumatoid arthritis, in consultation with a specialist, this has gone into remission, too.On the subject of antibiotics, Hamblin writes that they have commonly been prescribed for acne he says they “seem to play a part in causing and exacerbating autoimmune disease” and that “antibiotic overuse is likely to be a bigger threat to biomes than hygiene”.There is a good chance we will never understand our microbiomes well enough to manipulate them confidently and to positive effect. “Maybe there are some things we can do, but … it keeps coming back to this holistic sense of ‘everything matters’.”Microbiologists have found that hunter-gatherers and Amish people, who work together on farms from childhood, have optimally erse microbiomes and minimal chances of contracting autoimmune conditions and associated inflammation. Urban westerners who want to boost their more modest skin microbes would benefit from close contact with other people and animals, and from spending as much time as possible in nature, preferably getting dirty.But now that we are in a pandemic, much of that behaviour is on hold. In fact, if the relative sterility of the world before Covid-19 (in which Hamblin’s book was written) was already compromising our microbial balance, lockdowns and social distancing could challenge it even more. “I don’t know when we’ll go back to handshaking and ways that we might have been sharing different sorts of microbes with one another,” says Hamblin.Of course, reducing antibiotic use is key to microbiome success, along with resisting washing so frequently. Which brings us to bottoms – for this is what people visualise when they get grossed out over other people not soaping themselves. How can you get rid of unwanted residue down there with just your hand and water? “Dry toilet paper kind of creates that problem,” says Hamblin. “If you were gardening and had mud all over your hands, would you just use a dry paper towel? No, you’d at least get them wet and scrub them together. When people use bidets, they have less of an issue with that, or when people use disposable towelette things.” But the towelettes are expensive, wasteful and block drains, he admits, so “wetting toilet paper is fine”. This is his solution, which he shares to satisfy curiosity, rather than to preach or prescribe. And no, the paper does not fall apart when wet – “unless you’re trying to drown it”.Clean: The New Science of Skin and the Beauty of Doing Less by James Hamblin is published on 6 August by The Bodley Head (£16.99).

The cost to democracy is great. It takes a toll on civic engagement – even on citizens’ ability to have a common sense of reality and facts, the very basis of self-governance.”The news industry, where profits tend to vary between slim and non-existent, has particularly suffered over the past four months. Scores of newspapers have laid off staff or closed entirely, according to Poynter, and in April Penny Abernathy, the Knight chair in journalism and digital media economics at the University of North Carolina, told the  she expected “hundreds, not dozens” of newspapers and news websites to close.But this acute loss is the result of a long decline, Sullivan writes. More than 2,000 newspapers have closed since 2004: “and many of those that remain are mere shadows of their former selves”.Facebook and Google have borne much of the blame, sucking up the advertising that local newspapers, in particular, once relied on. The 2008 recession meant further losses.“Round after round of layoffs and buyouts at nearly every paper in the country resulted local journalists who thought they had a lifetime job covering local government, for example, were out on the street,” Sullivan writes.“Copy editors were deemed nonessential. Unsurprisingly, the quality of many newspapers went down.”The result was many communities no longer having a newspaper dedicated to local coverage, resulting in “news deserts” – areas which have no local news coverage at all. In 2018 a study by Abernathy, at the University of North Carolina, found that 1,300 US communities have completely lost news coverage.“Studies have shown us some interesting things. For example, municipal borrowing costs go up when local news declines. Why? Because the watchdog isn’t there – and so, local government becomes less efficient and more prone to corruption or at least wasteful spending,” Sullivan said.“We also know that people become less civically engaged when local news declines. They become more partisan: Less likely to cross the political aisle to vote for a candidate whose party they don’t belong to. It increases the tribalism that is already such a curse in American politics.”While this has been a long time coming, Sullivan believes it could have been exacerbated by the ascension of Trump, and his loathing of any media which disagrees with him.“I don’t know that it can be proven, but I firmly believe that Trump’s attacks on the press have caused harm,” Sullivan said.“When Americans are told day after day that reporters are dishonest, that they are ‘scum’ or ‘the enemy of the people’, it has an effect. It turns people against the press. And at least some people will react by walking away from traditional news sources.“Of course, the converse is also true – many people have decided they need trustworthy news sources more than ever. So it’s a mixture, and I think we need some time to pass before we figure out what the real effects have been.”It’s not all bad news for journalism, however. Sullivan points to the success some non-profit organizations have had in recent years as a way news organizations could revive their fortunes.“I’m also hopeful that more traditional outlets, particularly regional newspapers, will continue to increase the digital subscriptions in a way that will sustain them. There need to be many different ways to fill the growing void.“It’s really important because the way our democracy functions squarely rests on having informed citizens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fa134f3869f8b0a37a91827f3abe834956d6f7/0_193_5715_3429/master/5715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b53636a17d688e178c7da7c9447157da","title":"i cant contact odeon cinemas to get a ticket refund","story":"We booked a one-off showing that was cancelled but now we can’t get our money backWe booked in advance two tickets at £23.25 each for the Guildford Odeon’s live showing of the Royal Opera House production of Elektra on 18 June.

But cinema chains, where people typically don’t book well ahead (with the exception of more expensive one-off live screenings of opera, ballet and theatre, as in your case) have generally agreed to make refunds after closing all their venues in March. Some cinema chains and independents have been reopening since 4 July but where they remain closed you cannot simply walk in.When  Money got in touch, Odeon said your refund had slipped through the net.

Headteachers explain how it’s doneWhen it became apparent that the school lockdown was imminent, principal Vicki Redhead and her team at Bishop Creighton academy, a primary school in Peterborough, wrestled with a tricky issue. How can you make online-only learning as safe as possible? They came up with a simple solution. The devices they used at school were already set up and locked down. Why not just let children take those school devices home?“Otherwise, those devices – which were bought for the benefit of the children – were just going to sit in a cupboard,” she says. “Luckily, we had already made the decision that every child should have their own device. You’d never ask a child to share an exercise book.”Today’s tech makes it much simpler to make those tweaks – and schools which had been exploring its possibilities before the lockdown have already considered many of the big questions around online safety. Choosing devices that can be rolled out with ease is a key consideration in reducing IT complexity. At University Technical College (UTC) Reading in Berkshire, pupils had already received training on professional behaviour both face-to-face and online. “They know what’s right and what’s wrong, and the consequences of doing something that is outside what we would consider professional,” says principal Jon Nicholls. “And they get it. We have close ties with industry, and our students understand professional boundaries.”However, a secure platform is also crucial. UTC Reading’s Microsoft Teams package has considerable functionality for keeping both students and staff safe online. All student data is held securely. Only invited students can attend classes – nobody else can join. Teachers can invite students into small groups for additional support work without other students being aware. Another teacher or learning support staff member is always online to actively monitor student chat. And lessons are recorded and stored – including any chat – so they can be checked if any concerns are raised by staff or students.Choosing the correct platform can also help to solve the problem of device access. There has been an explosion of cloud-based learning platforms and tools in the education sector that are designed to be used solely in a web browser, says Brendan Tapping, chief executive officer at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust, a multi-academy trust that serves south Tyneside, Sunderland and east Durham.“This has overcome many of the hurdles that students would have faced when trying to complete work from home. The cloud-based learning platforms allow students to complete their homework anytime, anywhere from almost any device, including their own mobile phones,” he says.These platforms are also key to allowing staff to easily communicate, collaborate and share learning resources, tips and strategies, helping to replicate face-to-face staffroom discussions and prevent teachers themselves from feeling isolated.But although being online has its own risks, the biggest risk for a child is living in an environment where threats exist – and lockdown could mean more risk for them. How can schools keep track of them in an online-only environment? Again, they’re using established best practice combined with tech and the art of good communication.At Ribblesdale, the school’s online learning platform, Teams, logs everything – including how often a child logs on to the platform, which the school can then monitor. “If a child is not accessing any work, that’s the first potential warning that something is wrong,” says Cox. “But we won’t use technology if it’s not the most applicable way of safeguarding. We might simply decide to phone up a child if that’s the right thing to do.”Regular communication has also been paramount at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust. “All pupils and parents receive regular wellbeing phone calls from a familiar member of staff, with our most vulnerable pupils and parents or carers being spoken to on a daily basis,” says Tapping. “It’s key to ensuring our families feel fully supported and we can ensure we keep our community as safe as possible in their virtual learning world.”And as school leaders begin to contemplate what school life might look like in the future, Redhead is optimistic that the key to staying safe online is having that strong safeguarding culture embedded in the first place – and that hasn’t stopped in lockdown. “I’ve got 200-plus children accessing Teams, and nobody’s misbehaving!” she says. “Nobody’s using it inappropriately, and that’s not because I’m telling them not to do it – that’s around the culture in the school. We shouldn’t be afraid of tech. It’s where our children’s futures are going to be.”Five tips for online security1. Ensure staff are trained in online safety and recognise the security risk posed by phishing emails.2. Choose a cloud-based, secure online learning platform which allows recording of lessons and chats.3. Keep lines of communication with pupils and other agencies open – if necessary, just make a phone call.4. Encourage parents and pupils to use school devices which are already locked down, and loan them out if necessary.5. Think of tech as an enhancement to safeguarding, rather than a barrier to it.Interested in finding out more about safeguarding pupils online?

The battle is still going on – though it’s a bit more polite.“There is a tussle going to define Boris. We are reconciled to Brexit because of the democratic mandate from the election. But there is still a fight to be had about what sort of party we are – over agriculture and trade, over the economy and coronavirus support. Is this an attempt to bring out the liberal, one nation Boris? Yes, it is.”The former Cabinet Office minister Damian Green, who chairs the group, said he was keen to move the focus of the group away from Brexit and added that there was a need for an “intellectual regeneration” of the party.“In a first-past-the-post political system, a successful party has to be a coalition,” Green said. “And the moderate voice has got to be very loud inside the Conservative choir or it becomes narrow and sectarian.“If you want to see what can happen to parties who only appeal to a narrow part of their base, then look at 2019 and Labour. The Tory party must never end up like that. We have had bad times, when some of my best friends in politics were being thrown out of the Tory party. But I maintained what I want to continue fighting for.”The group’s new website, launched on Monday, counts more than 100 members, making up more than a third of the parliamentary party.Green said a significant number of the MPs contributing to the group were from the new intake of 2019 and were keen to contribute ideas on “levelling up” the ide between north and south. “This is exactly what their voters, first-time Conservatives, want to see.”Stephen Hammond, the former health minister who lost the Tory whip over his opposition to a no-deal Brexit but then regained it to fight the 2019 election, has written one of the group’s paper’s on the post-Covid economic recovery.“Much of this is where Boris has been, evidenced in the second half of his mayoralty in London. We want to present practical solutions to problems presenting us in the post-Covid world.”George Freeman, a former transport minister and the author of the group’s statement of principles, said: “Last year Boris won a massive majority by promising to end the Brexit civil war and deliver Brexit and an inspiring one nation programme of investment in ‘levelling up’ to spread opportunity across the whole country. We need to honour both parts of that promise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f15179127c1b2ddbef56e2d5059bd7362b7ba35f/0_224_8944_5366/master/8944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d47c4cef341d99b3186723e95d33d69c","title":"how chatbots can keep your customers loyal five trends reshaping retail right now","story":"Three experts look at how technology can help businesses recreate the joy of shopping – in a world that’s gone virtualCovid-19 has changed how we work – and few sectors are undergoing as much change as retail. A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Last week, a Manchester restaurant said it had received nearly 1,000 applications for a receptionist post within 24 hours, reflecting the pressure that the jobs market is under. Paid employment in Britain has fallen almost 650,000 employees since March, which has left some businesses inundated with applications.‘It’s frightening that so many people in the industry are out of work’One front-of-house position, paying £10-12 an hour, had more than 400 applications, compared with 40 in February, and 200 people applied to a full-time barista role at the same hourly rate, up from just 25 people at the start of the year.“We’re delighted to have such experienced candidates coming to us for jobs,” says general manager Victoria Sheppard, who has received applications from “really prestigious” hospitality backgrounds. “The downside is that it’s frightening so many people in the industry are out of work. You wish you could help more people.” Victoria expected an increase in applications due to the scale of recent job losses in the industry but says it is “tricky” to see overqualified candidates. “We were quite shocked to see people applying who were paid considerably more than we had advertised. We’re a mid-range, luxury hospitality company, but we’re not Michelin-starred.”‘I’ve not seen this volume of people applying for roles in over 20 years’“I’ve worked in recruitment since 1998 and I’ve never seen this volume of people applying for roles,” says Adam Jennings, director of JMF Associates, a recruitment company based in Beckenham, south-east London, that specialises in accounting and finance.“I’ve seen applications from people earning six figures who are willing to drop to £50,000 or £60,000 as they’ve lost jobs in hotel management, retail or the arts and leisure sector,” he says. ”It’s really tough, and it’s likely to get worse before we see any improvement.”‘There’s a different calibre of applicants applying’The Oxfordshire-based Evergreen Agency has received a 10-fold increase in the number of applications for its digital marketing roles since March.“We’d normally get half a dozen good applicants for a role,” says the managing director, Aaron Rudman-Hawkins. Not only has the digital marketing agency received 70 to 80 applications for recent postings in roles such as digital PR, but the quality of applicants has increased too. “It’s rich pickings,” says Rudman-Hawkins. “There’s a lot of talent out there – fantastic people with great skills sets. There’s a different calibre of applicants applying, which is great.”Its location might also be a factor. People might be more reluctant, because of the pandemic, to commute by public transport to London, says Rudman-Hawkins. ‘I can see my mental health declining massively’Ellie, based in Devon, has applied for 100 jobs since she was made redundant from a food service company the day before lockdown. She had been in the job for less than a month but with cafes and pubs closing, the business went downhill “really rapidly”. Ineligible for the government’s furlough scheme Ellie, 25, found herself out of work for the first time.“I had a good few weeks of being really down and depressed. I didn’t have the strength to job hunt,” says Ellie. She eventually landed a temporary contract with a call centre in May but knows that the work could end at any time. “It’s really stressful not knowing if I could be let go tomorrow,” she says.In the meantime, she has applied for all manner of permanent jobs – in pubs, restaurants, supermarkets, other call centres and offices – but is yet to get an interview.“I don’t think employers want people my age because we get a higher rate of pay,” she says, referring to the national living wage bands that rise to £8.72 an hour over the age of 25. “Even random pub jobs get 100 to 200 applicants … I don’t stand a chance.”“I’m worried for my future. I don’t know how long this is going to go on for. I’m really anxious and depressed all of the time,” says Ellie. “I can see my mental health declining massively, not getting out of bed in the morning. I expect it’s going to be really hard.”Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02eeb2913648cb3e17835016b96718c5177f0987/0_145_4368_2622/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26be1d3db2dd42244ea08234df431bee","title":"we are the ae of law the first uk law centre for poor people turns 50","story":"Austerity cuts to legal aid may have restricted North Kensington’s resources, but they haven’t crushed its spiritIn a basement office under the shadow of Grenfell Tower in west London – where discoloured water drips from the ceiling into a plastic bin – lawyers and caseworkers are this month celebrating the 50th anniversary of the UK’s first law centre.Established in July 1970, North Kensington Law Centre pioneered a social justice movement aimed at making the law accessible to everyone. Austerity cuts to legal aid may have restricted its resources but they have not crushed its spirit.Peter Kandler, a solicitor now aged 85, was the driving force behind its creation. The original office was in an old butcher’s shop on Golborne Road, a street at the top of Portobello Market in west London, now adorned with fashion outlets.“Meat hooks were still on the wall when we moved in,” recalled Kandler, brimming with reminiscences. “In those days, lawyers were people in suits you were respectful to. We didn’t get anyone through the door for the first day or two.“Then I put our newspaper cuttings in the window: the Sun had written ‘Poor Law in a Butcher’s Shop’. People realised we were proper lawyers and started coming in droves. We saw more than 200 in the first three weeks.”The initiative derived from radical ideas Kandler imbibed at the Partisan Coffee House in Soho, then the cultural centre of the New Left. Having begun his legal career in a firm that specialised in probates and trusts, it was for him a “political awakening”.By the late 1960s, Kandler was running advice stalls for campaign groups and helping Notting Hill residents resist eviction from exploitative landlords like the notorious Peter Rachman. “He offered us three houses at one stage to lay off him,” Kandler remembers.Among those involved were Michael Zander, formerly professor of law at the LSE and for many years the ’s legal affairs correspondent, and Lord Tony Gifford QC, one of the most prominent advocates of his generation. Zander had returned from studying law centres in the US.Kandler was one of the first solicitors who insisted on going into police stations to meet clients in an era where, he said, it was common for officers to beat confessions out of suspects – before codes under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 came into force.“Not only did the police beat you up, they also charged you with assault back then,” Kandler recalls. On one occasion, he says, he secured a client bail by instructing him to show the stipendiary magistrate bruises on his arm, face and chest.North Kensington’s success was copied widely. At the peak in the 2000s there were more than 70 law centres in the UK now, following a decade of austerity cuts, there are about 40.Housing cases, funded by legal aid for those who could not afford an expensive lawyer, remain an area of specialism. The others are immigration and asylum, welfare benefits, employment and criminal defence cases.The director is Annie Campbell Viswanathan. Her obsession, she confesses, is money – trying to secure sufficient funds to keep the law centre running. A significant portion of her time is spent navigating her way through the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the Legal Aid Agency. Immigration cases, for example, on average cost about £8,000 to run, she estimates, but usually only generate about £5,000 in legal aid payments.The failure to lift qualifying income thresholds for entitlement to legal aid for decades means that fewer and fewer people qualify for help. Many seeking help are turned away  or charged. Like other cash-strapped law centres, North Kensington has itself begun to charge for some immigration work and settlements in employment cases as a means of generating additional income. Last year it brought in £15,000 through charging those who did not qualify for legal aid.The more bureaucratic society becomes, the more important it is to be able to challenge decisions, Campbell Viswanathan believes. For example, the list of evidence required for Windrush compensation claims is a severe deterrent. “Some you have to prove to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt, others on the balance of probabilities. How is an ordinary person meant to manage that?”When she arrived in 2018, she says the centre was at risk of closure partially due to cuts imposed by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, which drastically restricted the scope of legal aid, and partially because the Grenfell Tower disaster consumed so much time but resulted in few adequately funded cases.As legal aid spending has been slashed and councils’ budgets squeezed in the last decade, law centres have had to seek more and more erse sources from grant-giving organisations to survive.For years the law centre has provided legal observers for the nearby Notting Hill carnival. Since the Grenfell Tower fire, it has been supporting victims’ families – helping with visas and immigration advice. A few families are still in temporary accommodation.Holly Stow, a young paralegal who has just finished her law degree, is leading the centre’s Windrush project, seeking compensation for those affected by the government’s hostile-environment policies. Because they could not prove their nationality status, people who came to Britain decades ago lost jobs, were evicted and were robbed of opportunities they would have otherwise enjoyed. Stow is already handling 35 claims including some brought by those who were deported.Covid-19 has meant the law centre’s half-century celebrations have been delayed until next year, although an online party was held this month. The pandemic also delivered £60,000 in one-off emergency funding from the Ministry of Justice that recognises the importance of law centres for those most in need.The law centre says many of its more vulnerable clients are unhappy working online and feel digitally excluded, so it is gradually reopening for face-to-face consultations.A further consequence of coronavirus is a massive backlog in housing cases. Evictions were suspended during lockdown but there are fears that there will be a surge of litigation. Campbell Viswanathan is trying to recruit another housing solicitor.“If you don’t have meaningful access to law, you don’t have democracy,” she says. “It’s simply lip service if the only people who can use the law are rich people.“Law centres have a really important democratic function – holding government to account. We are the A\u0026ampE of law. We are the people who pitch up when a crisis has occurred.”• 17 July 1970: North Kensington Law Centre opens for business in Golborne Road, west London.• 1975: Given government funding to keep it out of financial difficulties.• 1981: Fire at Clanricarde Gardens in nearby Notting Hill killed eight migrant workers.

Flo \u0026amp Joan and Ruby Wax’s daughters, Maddy and Marina Bye, on becoming family double acts They’ve been described as “the other popular comedy duo” from TV’s golden age, second only to Morecambe and Wise. But double-act life was not kind to Mike and Bernie Winters. They were together, they split up, they reunited. They agreed to separate for good, but set the date five years into the future. This, wrote one chronicler of comedy, was to “discover ever more rancorous ways to despise each other”. When they finally parted in 1978, it was only because their father had died: he had, Mike reported ruefully, “always wanted us to be together”. After that, Bernie replaced Mike with a St Bernard dog that became more popular than either of them.The Winters – born the Weinsteins – were brothers, of course, posing the question: who, knowing the fraught history of the comedy double act, would enter into such a relationship with their own sibling? Creative and financial co-dependency, meet deep-seated familial rivalry! And yet the sibling comedy twosome endures. From the Chuckle Brothers to This Country duo Charlie and Daisy May Cooper – and beyond, into a new generation of mostly female sibling double acts – the hope springs eternal that mutual acrimony can be forestalled by love and a sense of humour shared since infancy.Can it? One of today’s pre-eminent sibling duos is Flo \u0026amp Joan, the musical comedy partnership of Rosie and Nicola Dempsey. Their last show, drolly titled Before the Screaming Starts, referenced After the Screaming Stops, 2018’s must-see documentary on Bros, the band comprising two brothers whose lovehate relationship hurled sparks out of the screen. “We watched it and were like, ‘Oh shit,’” says Nicola. “It was such a jarring film. A lot of our friends were like, ‘Before anything else happens, you should watch this and take some notes.’”But Flo \u0026amp Joan seem far from the Bros or Mike and Bernie Winters prototype. Yes, there’s the song Assister Suicide from their Kindness of Stranglers show, in which Rosie offers to slip fentanyl in Nicola’s tea, and Nicola fantasises about throwing Rosie down the stairs. But in person – or at least, via Zoom – it’s all sisterly harmony.There are templates for the non-rancorous sibling comedy duo. Take the evidently loving and supportive Jamie and Natasia Demetriou, who make the sitcom Stath Lets Flats together – although they’ve never been a stage partnership. And who can forget (OK, most of us have forgotten) Cockney charwomen Gert and Daisy – AKA Elsie and Doris Waters – who reputedly helped Britain win the war via their popular radio shows, and were personally thanked by Churchill for doing so. Having shared music halls with Laurel and Hardy in the 1930s, Gert and Daisy lived and worked together happily until Doris’s death in 1978. Likewise, the Chuckle Brothers remained inseparable until Barry Chuckle’s recent demise – and beyond, if we’re to believe Paul’s claim that Barry now returns from the afterlife to comfort him in his dreams.Chat to Marina and Maddy Bye – performing as the double act Siblings – and you could believe they’ll still be besties beyond the grave. “I’m overwhelmingly happy,” says Maddy to Marina, “if you do something really funny on stage. You can see it on my face. It’s a big sisterly thing.” These daughters of the comedian Ruby Wax gave been in lockdown together in their shared home. Says Marina: “When you’ve lived with someone all your life and come out of the same womb, you speak the same language. You understand each other’s rhythms, each other’s humour. When Maddy and I do comedy together, it’s like we could finish each other sentences. We never collide, we never interrupt.”And then there’s the efficiency – attested to by Flo \u0026amp Joan as well – of making comedy with a sibling. “If Maddy writes something I don’t think is funny,” says Marina, “I’ll just straight up be like, that’s not funny. In a double act without a sibling, I can’t imagine being able to speak that brutally.”We’re getting to the nub, presumably, of why siblings might make comedy together: because they’ve spent their entire childhoods making each other laugh, and refining a worldview (and a way of communicating) that’s unique to them. Rose Rock – mother of superstar standup Chris and not-so-superstar standups Tony and Jordan – once told an interviewer, “Maybe it’s in the breast milk?” But Maddy Bye of Siblings prefers the nurture to nature argument: “Lots of siblings do plays together when they’re kids. And I guess it’s just the chance of doing that as a grownup.”But Siblings don’t make comedy out of their closeness – they make comedy out of their rivalry. The shtick, based in truth, is that Marina is a trained actor with delusions of grandeur, and Maddy is a clown (taught by Parisian guru Philippe Gaulier) who undermines her at every turn. Siblings come together to their shows, the sisters tell me. “We play on the sibling competition,” says Marina, “because people really enjoy watching it.”They’re not the first to do so: Sarah and Lizzie Daykin burned brightly but briefly in the mid-2010s with their double act Toby, which played sibling antagonism with a scarily straight bat. Flo \u0026amp Joan, by contrast, actively avoid rivalry as a subject for comedy – but, like Siblings, their audiences just can’t help remarking on the sister thing. Says Rosie Dempsey: “They’ll tell us, ‘I brought my sister along. We think we look like you!’” Adds Nicola: “They never look like us. It’s just that one of them has blonde hair, and one has dark hair and glasses.”A fascination with their personal relationship is clearly part of what draws audiences to sibling double acts. “People find siblings weird in general,” says Rosie. “Even as adults, if you meet two people in a bar, and one of them says, ‘This is my sister,’ it’s like, ‘Oh my GOD!’ We know what a sibling is – it’s not an odd new thing. But a lot of people can’t imagine working with a family member, and find it strange that anyone would want to.” Who never looked at the Chuckle Brothers in action and thought: there’s something a bit odd here?“Then there’s the fact,” adds Rosie, “that if the show goes wrong, audiences are not only embarrassed for you, they’re embarrassed for your family.” Flo \u0026amp Joan were scheduled to tour this spring, and expected to spend every day in one another’s company. Says Nicola: “If we were any other double act or a band, you wouldn’t think that was weird. But when it’s your sister and you’re adults, and you can say, ‘We haven’t spent a day apart since the beginning of January,’ people worry about you.”That hasn’t happened yet, nor looks likely in either Flo \u0026amp Joan or Siblings’ case. But then, like most family comedy duos these days, they’re female. Whither the brother-brother double acts? Do men feel more need to establish their independence from family ties? Is the male double act somehow doomed to “rancorous ways to despise each other” – or just punching each other in the face?Perhaps, says Rosie Dempsey, with due caution, “it’s because women in families tend to take the maternal role. So at the end of the day, they have to come back to family. Whereas guys often flee the nest?” Either way, it’s left the field clear for Flo \u0026amp Joan, or Siblings, to become the Chuckle Brothers de nos jours. “It’s working,” says Nicola Dempsey, cheerfully. “We write and perform well together. I know it makes us sound co-dependent and embarrassing, but as long as it’s fun, we’ll carry on.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

However, despite the government’s long list of exempt countries and territories, only a limited number will allow Britons in without restrictions on arrival. Currently, this is 28 – out of the government’s list of 79.Many of the destinations on the list still have their own restrictions in place, including testing, quarantine procedures and outright bans on tourists. Australia and New Zealand’s borders remain closed to international tourists and Austria, Cyprus and Japan have restrictions on countries that have seen high levels of coronavirus, including the UK. Spain and Portugal – popular destinations for UK tourists – are currently omitted from the government’s list.The Department for Transport’s (DfT) current list of  travel corridors, includes 79 countries and overseas territories. Arrivals from these locations (both overseas tourists entering and UK nationals returning) will not face quarantine in the UK. In addition, the Foreign Office (FCO) is also continuing to update its advice for a list of countries it no longer considers high-risk (which is being added to periodically). This gives the go-ahead for non-essential travel, although many of these countries still have their own restrictions or bans in place.Regardless of whether the UK government says it is safe to travel to a country, each destination has its own rules on who can enter. Some countries may not permit UK nationals to enter and they may ban anyone who has been in the UK in the previous 14 days. Security measures could also be in place at borders to prevent potential loopholes for passengers attempting to transit through other “safe” countries in order to dodge travel bans.Although there are now many destinations open to UK tourists without restrictions, some may still have health screening on arrival or an entry form to complete before leaving. Arrivals from the UK may also face restrictions if they have travelled to other countries in the 14 days prior. Countries not listed below may require testing on arrival, mandatory quarantine or have a ban on arrivals from the UK. The situation is constantly changing and restrictions could be subject to re-enforcement without notice.This article was first published on 6 July.

It calls to mind series such as Dave, I May Destroy You or Fleabag – shows based on flawed but likable protagonists, addressing questions of morality for a millennial audience with humour and darkness. As it’s currently tricky to stream in the UK (it is available on Amazon’s StarzPlay channel here), you may not have heard of it. But, with a Golden Globe win earlier this year and season two guest-starring Oscar winner Mahershala Ali, momentum is building round both the man and the show.Like TV Ramy, real-life Ramy grew up in New Jersey, visiting his grandparents in New York on weekends and spending his summers in Cairo. Real Ramy was into comedy and film-making as a hobby, but it was Laith Nakli (who plays Uncle Naseem in Ramy) who convinced him to seriously pursue acting when they met at a comedy festival more than 10 years ago. At 20, Youssef landed a job on a Nickelodeon sitcom and moved to LA, where he managed to sell Ramy before he even had a standup special out. Beyond that, I am reluctant to ask how much further the similarities go – especially considering that some of the storylines are a bit spicy (episode one has a toe-curling scene where a girl wants Ramy to choke her during sex).The focus of the series is not just Ramy himself. Some of the most groundbreaking episodes are when the lens moves away from him and focuses on the other members of his family. Each is viewed with affection, but none are without their own, sometimes infuriating flaws. Ramy’s father defines himself by his work and struggles when he loses his job, while his chauvinistic brother-in-law, Ramy’s uncle Naseem, is a successful businessman. Best of all is his neurotic mother (Succession’s Hiam Abbass) whose unsolicited advice and objectionable opinions are reminiscent of a classic Arab auntie. What is striking is how her character appears in the episodes away from her children, where she is revealed as more than just a mother: complex and conflicted like Ramy himself, with her own sexual desires and frustrations. “I want to look at the way that we stereotype ourselves,” Youssef says.Many of the themes raised in the show are universal, from the differences between generations to what it means to be a man. “How has Ramy been influenced by the way he’s been treated versus the way his sister’s been treated by their mother and father?” asks Youssef. “It’s like he has been babied so much because he’s a boy that it’s prevented him from becoming a man, or even just a version of his potential.”In an age when tribalism groups people according to politics, race and experience, it is refreshing to see such seemingly contradictory yet relatable characters existing even within a nuclear family. The struggle isn’t just about “us” and “them”. As a practising Muslim, Ramy doesn’t simply have to contend with an Islamophobic society some of his biggest issues are coming to terms with himself and his relationship with his own faith.“I think for every character, very much so for the Ramy character, it’s ‘me versus me’,” he explains. “Whether it be with writers who are in our room or whether it be with people who are in my life, I try to imagine: what are they hiding?”This approach has resulted in a show so honest that it can make for uncomfortable viewing. In series two, Ramy is getting to know a Muslim woman, and tries to be honest with her about his sexual history and the fact he thinks he has been watching too much porn. She advises him to “hide his sins”, a cultural and religious value that is shared across different Muslim communities.So how does he square that principle with making a show that lays bare the transgressions of his characters? “If anything, because this show is fiction, this is a place to explore sin,” he says. “It allows there to be a reference point to talk about things, while others can continue to hide their sin.” For Youssef, this is the role of art in the community. “What should the artist be doing exactly? Showing Islam and its perfection? No, that’s what the teachers, imams and the sheikhs are supposed to be doing. I’m not studied on Islam, so my job, if anything, is to show a nuanced story in which we can discuss things. It doesn’t feel like a contradiction at all. If anything it feels like the purpose of the show.”Youssef has been surprised at the show’s positive reception in the Middle East. “They get that we’re skipping all the entry-level conversations and trying to get into nuances about faith and ego. There’s this desire where American audiences sometimes are like: ‘Couldn’t you just have had some wholesome conversations as opposed to getting into all the ego, sex and drugs – all this stuff you went right into that makes people feel uncomfortable?’”Mahershala Ali’s appearance in season two, playing a wise and loving sheikh, has drawn more attention to the show. It’s clear that for Youssef this partnership was just as important on a personal level. “To me, it seems like a ine collaboration,” he says excitedly. Ali first reached out to thank Ramy for making series one. “It turned into me angling for us to meet and hang and eat,” he continues. Soon Ali was on set, praying with Ramy between scenes. “You never see a religious leader on TV that isn’t chockful of hypocrisies or corruption, and we get to have this guy who is full of love,” he says. “It’s so hard to even imagine someone else playing that role.”Even off screen, Youssef has led with his faith. When he received his Golden Globe earlier this year for lead actor in a comedy series, he thanked God in his acceptance speech, saying “Allahu Akbar”, a phrase that in the western world is often associated with acts of terrorism, but for Muslims simply means “God is great”. He was asked in the press room later if he did so for the benefit of host Ricky Gervais – a staunch atheist – whose monologue roasting Hollywood’s hypocrisies and performative politics went viral.“The timing of it was funny after what Ricky said, but it was really important,” Youssef says, adding that Gervais is “a really funny and a really cool dude”. He even reached out to Gervais about how the line between atheists and believers has come full circle. “I told Ricky that he talked about God so much, he might be Muslim!” he laughs.As trust in the media and lawmakers declines, much comedy has become more political. What does Youssef make of people turning to comedians such as Trevor Noah and Hasan Minhaj for their news? “To me that’s a genre of comedy,” he says carefully. “The truth I think comedy should be providing is emotional truth.Ramy season two is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video’s StarzPlay from 6 August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b0aad22638133aa06cd68347bed2390b555e63/0_477_2945_1767/master/2945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7ca603b79a21df7596d0b0e25127d","title":"pet cat diagnosed with covid 19 uk government confirms","story":"Siamese cat is thought to have caught virus from its ownersA female Siamese cat has become the first animal in the UK to catch coronavirus, prompting a warning to owners not to kiss their pets or share food with them.The cat from southern England is believed to have caught the virus from their owner in May. It was initially diagnosed by a private vet with feline herpes. But samples from the cat tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 in June as part of a coronavirus screening programme for hundreds of cats at Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.Follow-up samples tested at the Animal Plant Health Laboratory in Weybridge last week confirmed the cat was also infected with Covid-19.The six-year-old cat experienced only mild symptoms including shortness of breath and nasal discharge and has since recovered. But Margaret Hosie, professor of comparative virology at Glasgow University, who leads the screening programme, advised cat owners to “observe very careful hygiene”.She said: “If you have any respiratory signs, then be sure to catch your cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue, and wash your hands before you handle your cat. Don’t kiss your cat. Don’t have the cat sleeping in a bed with you, and don’t share food with the cat.”She expressed surprise that a Siamese cat, a breed which has short fur, caught the disease. “I thought maybe fluffier ones would be more ready to catch any sneezes or cough droplets. But you can’t draw any significance from that.”She stressed that only a handful of cats around the world had tested positive for coronavirus and there was no evidence that the animals could transmit the disease to humans.In early April the British Veterinary Association created panic among cat owners after its president, Daniella Dos Santos, appeared to suggest the UK’s estimated 10.9 million cats should be kept at home during the pandemic.After its website crashed, the BVA was forced to clarify that only owners who were self-isolating should keep their pets indoors if possible, raising the prospect of Larry the Downing Street cat having to go into isolation.Dos Santos said the positive test should not cause alarm. She said: “It is really important that nobody should panic. There have been a tiny handful of cases across the world where pet animals have been infected with covid and there is no evidence that pets can pass on covid to their owners.”She repeated the BVA advice that cat owners who have tested positive for Covid-19 or have symptoms should keep their cats indoors if possible.said: “This is a very rare event with infected animals detected to date only showing mild clinical signs and recovering within in a few days.“There is no evidence to suggest that pets directly transmit the virus to humans. We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change.”Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said it was a reminder for people to wash their hands after contact with animals. “This is the first case of a domestic cat testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK but should not be a cause for alarm,” she said.“The investigation into this case suggest that the infection was spread from humans to animal, and not the other way round. At this time, there is no evidence that pets can transmit the disease to humans.”A small number of cases of animals infected with Covid-19 have been reported globally, including a number of tigers and lions at the Bronx zoo in New York."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96adef04df7016d9004fa1f703d3c9a418e657ee/154_0_2681_1610/master/2681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e95b0f641d08ebebc7b4d0cd1853eeb","title":"berlin couple test positive for coronavirus after manchester visit","story":"Urgent track and trace operation under way after couple’s entire family infectedAn urgent track and trace operation is under way in Berlin after a couple tested positive for coronavirus after returning from a holiday to visit friends in Manchester.Fifty people who have had contact with the couple since their return are in quarantine, of whom 13 have so far tested positive for Covid-19. The Turkish couple, a 50-year-old taxi driver and his 45-year-old wife, arrived home on a Ryanair flight on 16 July. They were not diagnosed until six days after their return. The whole family is now infected, including the couple’s four children, aged nine to 21, and their grandmother.Gudrun Widders, an official at the local health office in the Berlin-Spandau district, told the Bild newspaper that no one in the family has required hospital treatment.She said that the health office had made repeated attempts to contact Ryanair so that the airline could contact other passengers who were on the plane, but that it has “so far had no feedback”.It is not known if Ryanair has reacted to the information and informed other passengers who were on the same flight as the couple.In a separate development, Germany’s foreign ministry advised holidaymakers on Tuesday not to travel to several Spanish regions, including Catalonia, that have seen coronavirus infection rates rise. “We currently advise against unnecessary tourist trips to the autonomous communities of Aragon, Catalonia and Navarre due to high infection numbers and local lockdowns,” the ministry said on its website.From Wednesday, Berlin airports will be offering free tests to people arriving in the city. On Monday, the state of Bavaria spearheaded the mass rollout of coronavirus testing facilities in the hope of reaching as many returning holidaymakers as possible.

There are also concerns that masks could affect communication in classes.However, with face coverings now mandatory in most enclosed public spaces across England, including inside shops and on public transport, unions say the current policy in schools is out of step with wider public health policy, and they want teachers and school staff to have the same protection as other workers.With masks also compulsory for children over the age of 11 in these public spaces, the NASUWT teaching union believes there is now a strong case for wearing them to be made compulsory for older children when they return to school in September.“The government’s wider public health advice confirms that whilst children aged under 11 are not required to wear face masks, they are mandatory for children aged over 11 when they visit a range of other facilities,” said the NASUWT’s general secretary, Dr Patrick Roach. “So there is a strong argument that face masks should also be made compulsory for children when they return to secondary schools in September.”Some schools are already taking the matter into their own hands. Neil Strowger, the chief executive officer of the Bohunt education trust, which has seven schools in the south-east of England, said: “We are encouraging our community to wear masks inside, as there is evidence to support their use, but we are clear that students and staff are not required to wear them.”Dr David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School and the co-chair of the medical academic staff committee of the British Medical Association (BMA), did not advocate face masks in primary schools but agreed that masks for teenagers in secondary school – in situations where they could not keep their distance – were a sensible precaution.The BMA, which is one of the top representative bodies for doctors, has said that wherever 2-metre social distancing cannot be observed, including in schools, masks should be worn as a way of limiting transmission.“When it comes to teenagers in secondary school, they are very unlikely to be badly affected by Covid, but there is some evidence that they can be carriers and spread it on,” said Strain. “Therefore the idea of them wearing masks to stop spread around the school – enabling them to potentially take it home to older relatives and also risking teachers – is a sensible precaution.”Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said masks were already in use in schools in some other countries. “We expect that most schools will follow the existing guidance, although some may decide to use face coverings as an extra level of assurance.”Karen Leonard, a national officer at the GMB union, added: “GMB’s position is to allow school staff to wear masks if they want to. Staff who may be vulnerable or at increased risk should not be prevented from wearing them.”Avis Gilmore, the deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It remains our view that no member of staff or pupil should be prevented from wearing a face mask if they wish to do so and we anticipate that the majority of schools and colleges will respect this.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have set out the controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission of the virus when they open to all children from September.“This does not include the wearing of face coverings as we believe the system of controls laid out adequately reduced the risk of transmission to both staff and students.”• This article was amended on 28 July 2020. An earlier version incorrectly stated that the Bohunt education trust had “eight schools in Hampshire”. Text about the rules on wearing face coverings in England was also changed to clarify that it is mandatory in most enclosed public spaces, but not all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2fcc0ca6d40a5eebcec2597f06e8b327e08de5c/0_868_5218_3132/master/5218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2ead67f2001284a6cca1a12a15f2651","title":"untouchables caste system us race martin luther king india","story":"We cannot fully understand the current upheavals, or almost any turning point in American history, without accounting for the human pyramid that is encrypted into us all: the caste system. By  Isabel WilkersonIn the winter of 1959, after leading the Montgomery bus boycott that arose from the arrest of Rosa Parks and before the trials and triumphs to come, Martin Luther King Jr and his wife, Coretta, landed in India, in the city then known as Bombay, to visit the land of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of nonviolent protest. They were covered in garlands upon arrival, and King told reporters: “To other countries, I may go as a tourist, but to India I come as a pilgrim.”He had long dreamed of going to India, and they stayed an entire month. King wanted to see for himself the place whose fight for freedom from British rule had inspired his fight for justice in America. He wanted to see the so-called “untouchables”, the lowest caste in the ancient Indian caste system, whom he had read about and had sympathy for, but who had still been left behind after India gained its independence the decade before.He discovered that people in India had been following the trials of his own oppressed people in the US, and knew of the bus boycott he had led. Wherever he went, the people on the streets of Bombay and Delhi crowded around him for an autograph. At one point in their trip, King and his wife journeyed to the southern tip of the country, to the city of Trivandrum in the state of Kerala, and visited with high-school students whose families had been untouchables. The principal made the introduction.“Young people,” he said, “I would like to present to you a fellow untouchable from the United States of America.”King was floored. He had not expected that term to be applied to him. He was, in fact, put off by it at first. He had flown in from another continent, and had dined with the prime minister. He did not see the connection, did not see what the Indian caste system had to do directly with him, did not immediately see why the lowest-caste people in India would view him, an American Negro and a distinguished visitor, as low-caste like themselves, see him as one of them. “For a moment,” he wrote, “I was a bit shocked and peeved that I would be referred to as an untouchable.”Then he began to think about the reality of the lives of the people he was fighting for – 20 million people, consigned to the lowest rank in the US for centuries, “still smothering in an airtight cage of poverty,” quarantined in isolated ghettoes, exiled in their own country.And he said to himself: “Yes, I am an untouchable, and every negro in the United States of America is an untouchable.” In that moment, he realised that the land of the free had imposed a caste system not unlike the caste system of India, and that he had lived under that system all of his life. It was what lay beneath the forces he was fighting in the US.What Martin Luther King Jr, recognised about his country that day had begun long before the ancestors of our ancestors had taken their first breaths. More than a century and a half before the American Revolution, a human hierarchy had evolved on the contested soil of what would become the United States – a concept of birthright, the temptation of entitled expansion that would set in motion what has been called the world’s oldest democracy and, with it, a ranking of human value and usage.It would twist the minds of men, as greed and self-reverence eclipsed human conscience and allowed the conquering men to take land and human bodies that they convinced themselves they had a right to. If they were to convert this wilderness and civilise it to their liking, they decided, they would need to conquer, enslave or remove the people already on it, and transport those they deemed lesser beings in order to tame and work the land to extract the wealth that lay in the rich soil and shorelines.To justify their plans, they took pre-existing notions of their own centrality, reinforced by their self-interested interpretation of the Bible, and created a hierarchy of who could do what, who could own what, who was on top and who was on the bottom and who was in between. There emerged a ladder of humanity, global in nature, as the upper-rung people would descend from Europe, with rungs inside that designation – the English Protestants at the very top, as their guns and resources would ultimately prevail in the bloody fight for North America. Everyone else would rank in descending order, on the basis of their proximity to those deemed most superior. The ranking would continue downward until one arrived at the very bottom: African captives transported in order to build the New World and to serve the victors for all their days, one generation after the next, for 12 generations.There developed a caste system, based upon what people looked like – an internalised ranking, unspoken, unnamed and unacknowledged by everyday citizens even as they go about their lives adhering to it and acting upon it subconsciously, to this day. Just as the studs and joists and beams that form the infrastructure of a building are not visible to those who live in it, so it is with caste. Its very invisibility is what gives it power and longevity. And though it may move in and out of consciousness, though it may flare and reassert itself in times of upheaval and recede in times of relative calm, it is an ever-present through-line in the country’s operation.A caste system is an artificial construction, a fixed and embedded ranking of human value that sets the presumed supremacy of one group against the presumed inferiority of others, on the basis of ancestry and often of immutable traits – traits that would be neutral in the abstract, but are ascribed life-and-death meaning in a hierarchy favouring the dominant caste whose forebears designed it. A caste system uses rigid, often arbitrary boundaries to keep the ranked groupings apart, distinct from one another and in their assigned places.Throughout human history, three caste systems have stood out. The tragically accelerated, chilling and officially vanquished caste system of Nazi Germany. The lingering, millennia-long caste system of India. And the shape-shifting, unspoken, race-based caste pyramid in the US. Each version relied on stigmatising those deemed inferior in order to justify the dehumanisation necessary to keep the lowest-ranked people at the bottom, and to rationalise the protocols of enforcement. A caste system endures because it is often justified as ine will, originating from a sacred text or the presumed laws of nature, reinforced throughout the culture and passed down through the generations.As we go about our daily lives, caste is the wordless usher in a darkened theatre, the flashlight cast down the aisles, guiding us to our assigned seats for a performance. The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power: which groups have it and which do not. It is about resources: which caste is seen as worthy of them, and which are not who gets to acquire and control them, and who does not. It is about respect, authority and assumptions of competence: who is accorded these, and who is not.As a means of assigning value to entire swaths of humankind, caste guides each of us, often beyond the reaches of our awareness. It embeds into our bones an unconscious ranking of human characteristics, and sets forth the rules, expectations and stereotypes that have been used to justify brutalities against entire groups within our species. In the American caste system, the signal of rank is what we call race, the ision of humans on the basis of their appearance. In the US, race is the primary tool and the visible decoy – the frontman – for caste.Race does the heavy lifting for a caste system that demands a means of human ision. If we have been trained to see humans in the language of race, then caste is the underlying grammar that we encode as children, as when learning our mother tongue. Caste, like grammar, becomes an invisible guide not only to how we speak, but to how we process information – the autonomic calculations that figure into a sentence without our having to think about it. Many of us have never taken a class in grammar, yet we know in our bones that a transitive verb takes an object, that a subject needs a predicate, and we know without thinking the difference between third-person singular and third-person plural. We might mention “race”, referring to people as black or white or Latino or Asian or indigenous, when what lies beneath each label is centuries of history, and the assigning of assumptions and values to physical features in a structure of human hierarchy.What people look like – or rather, the race they have been assigned, or are perceived to belong to – is the visible cue to their caste. It is the historic flashcard to the public, showing how people are to be treated, where they are expected to live, what kinds of positions they are expected to hold, whether they belong in this section of town or that seat in a boardroom, whether they should be expected to speak with authority on this or that subject, whether they will be administered pain relief in a hospital, whether their neighbourhood is likely to adjoin a toxic waste site or to have contaminated water flowing from their taps, whether they are more or less likely to survive childbirth in the most advanced nation in the world, whether they may be shot by authorities with impunity.Caste and race are neither synonymous nor mutually exclusive. They can and do coexist in the same culture, and serve to reinforce each other. Caste is the bones, race the skin. Race is what we can see, the physical traits that have been given arbitrary meaning and become shorthand for who a person is. Caste is the powerful infrastructure that holds each group in its place.Caste is fixed and rigid. Race is fluid and superficial, subject to periodic redefinition to meet the needs of the dominant caste in what is now the US. While the requirements to qualify as white have changed over the centuries, the fact of a dominant caste has remained constant from its inception – whoever fit the definition of white, at whatever point in history, was granted the legal rights and privileges of the dominant caste. Perhaps more critically and tragically, at the other end of the ladder, the subordinated caste, too, has been fixed from the beginning as the psychological floor beneath which all other castes cannot fall.Caste is not a term often applied to the US. It is considered the language of India or feudal Europe. But some anthropologists and scholars of race in the US have made use of the term for decades. Before the modern era, one of the earliest Americans to take up the idea of caste was the antebellum abolitionist and US senator Charles Sumner, as he fought against segregation in the north. “The separation of children in the Public Schools of Boston, on account of color or race,” he wrote, “is in the nature of Caste, and on this account is a violation of Equality.” He quoted a fellow humanitarian: “Caste makes distinctions among creatures where God has made none.”We cannot fully understand the current upheavals, or almost any turning point in American history, without accounting for the human pyramid that is encrypted into us all. The caste system, and the attempts to defend, uphold or abolish the hierarchy, underlay the American civil war and the civil rights movement a century later, and pervade the politics of the 21st-century US. Just as DNA is the code of instructions for cell development, caste has been the operating system for economic, political and social interaction in the US since the time of its gestation.In 1944, the Swedish social economist Gunnar Myrdal and a team of the most talented researchers in the country produced a 2,800-page, two-volume work that is still considered perhaps the most comprehensive study of race in the US. It was titled An American Dilemma. Myrdal’s investigation into race led him to the realisation that the most accurate term to describe the workings of US society was not race, but caste – and that perhaps it was the only term that really addressed what seemed a stubbornly fixed ranking of human value.The anthropologist Ashley Montagu was among the first to argue that race is a human invention – a social construct, not a biological one – and that in seeking to understand the isions and disparities in the US, we have typically fallen into the quicksand and mythology of race. “When we speak of ‘the race problem in America’,” he wrote in 1942, “what we really mean is the caste system and the problems which that caste system creates in America.”There was little confusion among some of the leading white supremacists of the previous century as to the connections between India’s caste system and that of the American south, where the purest legal caste system in the US existed. “A record of the desperate efforts of the conquering upper classes in India to preserve the purity of their blood persists to until this very day in their carefully regulated system of castes,” wrote Madison Grant, a popular eugenicist, in his 1916 bestseller, The Passing of the Great Race. “In our Southern States, Jim Crow cars and social discriminations have exactly the same purpose.”In 1913, Bhimrao Ambedkar, a man born to the bottom of India’s caste system, born an untouchable in the central provinces, arrived in New York City from Bombay. He came to the US to study economics as a graduate student at Columbia, focused on the differences between race, caste and class. Living just blocks from Harlem, he would see first-hand the condition of his counterparts in the US. He completed his thesis just as the film The Birth of a Nation – the incendiary homage to the Confederate south – premiered in New York in 1915. He would study further in London and return to India to become the foremost leader of the untouchables, and a pre-eminent intellectual who would help draft a new Indian constitution. He would work to dispense with the demeaning term “untouchable”. He rejected the term Harijans, which had been applied to them by Gandhi, to their minds patronisingly. He renamed his people Dalits, meaning “broken people” – which, due to the caste system, they were.It is hard to know what effect his exposure to the American social order had on him personally. But over the years, he paid close attention, as did many Dalits, to the subordinate caste in the US. Indians had long been aware of the plight of enslaved Africans, and of their descendants in the US. Back in the 1870s, after the end of slavery and during the brief window of black advancement known as Reconstruction, an Indian social reformer named Jyotirao Phule found inspiration in the US abolitionists. He expressed hope “that my countrymen may take their example as their guide”.Many decades later, in the summer of 1946, acting on news that black Americans were petitioning the United Nations for protection as minorities, Ambedkar reached out to the best-known African American intellectual of the day, WEB Du Bois. He told Du Bois that he had been a “student of the Negro problem” from across the oceans, and recognised their common fates.“There is so much similarity between the position of the Untouchables in India and of the position of the Negroes in America,” Ambedkar wrote to Du Bois, “that the study of the latter is not only natural but necessary.”Du Bois wrote back to Ambedkar to say that he was, indeed, familiar with him, and that he had “every sympathy with the Untouchables of India”. It had been Du Bois who seemed to have spoken for the marginalised in both countries as he identified the doubleconsciousness of their existence. And it was Du Bois who, decades before, had invoked an Indian concept in channelling the “bitter cry” of his people in the US: “Why did God make me an outcast and a stranger in mine own house?”I began investigating the American caste system after nearly two decades of examining the history of the Jim Crow south, the legal caste system that grew out of enslavement and lasted into the early 70s, within the lifes of many present-day Americans. I discovered that I was not writing about geography and relocation, but about the American caste system – an artificial hierarchy in which most everything that you could and could not do was based upon what you looked like, and which manifested itself north and south. I had been writing about a stigmatised people – 6 million of them – who were seeking freedom from the caste system in the south, only to discover that the hierarchy followed them wherever they went, much in the way that the shadow of caste (as I would soon discover) follows Indians in their own global diaspora.The American caste system began in the years after the arrival of the first Africans to the Colony of Virginia in the summer of 1619, as the colony sought to refine the distinctions of who could be enslaved for life and who could not. Over time, colonial laws granted English and Irish indentured servants greater privileges than the Africans who worked alongside them, and the Europeans were fused into a new identity – that of being categorised as white, the polar opposite of black. The historian Kenneth M Stampp called this assigning of race a “caste system, which ided those whose appearance enabled them to claim pure Caucasian ancestry from those whose appearance indicated that some or all of their forebears were Negroes”. Members of the Caucasian caste, as he called it, “believed in ‘white supremacy’, and maintained a high degree of caste solidarity to secure it”.While I was in the midst of my research, word of my inquiries spread to some Indian scholars of caste based in the US. They invited me to speak at an inaugural conference on caste and race at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, the town where WEB Du Bois was born and where his papers are kept.There, I told the audience that I had written a 600-page book about the Jim Crow era in the American south – the time of naked white supremacy – but that the word “racism” did not appear anywhere in the narrative. I told them that, after spending 15 years studying the topic and hearing the testimony of the survivors of the era, I had realised that the term was insufficient. “Caste” was the more accurate term, and I set out to them the reasons why. They were both stunned and heartened. The plates of Indian food kindly set before me at the reception thereafter sat cold due to the press of questions and the sharing that went on into the night.At a closing ceremony, the hosts presented to me a bronze-coloured bust of the patron saint of the low-born of India, Bhimrao Ambedkar, the Dalit leader who had written to Du Bois all those decades before.It felt like an initiation into a caste to which I had somehow always belonged. Over and over, they shared stories of what they had endured, and I responded in personal recognition, as if even to anticipate some particular turn or outcome. To their astonishment, I began to be able to tell who was high-born and who was low-born among the Indian people there, not from what they looked like, as one might in the US, but on the basis of the universal human response to hierarchy – in the case of an upper-caste person, an inescapable certitude in bearing, demeanour, behaviour and a visible expectation of centrality.On the way home, I was snapped back into my own world when airport security flagged my suitcase for inspection. The TSA worker happened to be an African American who looked to be in his early 20s. He strapped on latex gloves to begin his work. He dug through my suitcase and excavated a small box, unwrapped the folds of paper and held in his palm the bust of Ambedkar that I had been given.“This is what came up in the X-ray,” he said. It was heavy like a paperweight. He turned it upside down and inspected it from all sides, his gaze lingering at the bottom of it. He seemed concerned that something might be inside.“I’ll have to swipe it,” he warned me. He came back after some time and declared it OK, and I could continue with it on my journey. He looked at the bespectacled face, with its receding hairline and steadfast expression, and seemed to wonder why I would be carrying what looked like a totem from another culture.“So who is this?” he asked.“Oh,” I said, “this is the Martin Luther King of India.”“Pretty cool,” he said, satisfied now, and seeming a little proud.He then wrapped Ambedkar back up as if he were King himself, and set him back gently into the suitcase.

Both sides are warning that failure – meaning that Britain would leave after the transition period on 31 December without a deal – is a real prospect. Those working for Michel Barnier, the EU negotiator, complain that the British have wasted July by refusing to offer meaningful compromises.Failure is certainly possible. But a deal this year is more likely, for several reasons. First, there has been more progress than one might suppose from the public comments of Barnier and David Frost, the UK negotiator. The EU has hinted at a softer line on fisheries and state aid, and agreed that an arbitration mechanism rather than the European court of justice should adjudicate on disputes.The UK has moved a little, too. By making clear that it will stay in the European convention of human rights it has facilitated future cooperation on justice and home affairs. And it has agreed to the EU’s demand for an overarching structure encompassing various EU-UK deals, as opposed to a series of disconnected agreements (which the EU has with Switzerland and strongly dislikes).Another encouraging sign is that Northern Ireland has become less neuralgic. The withdrawal agreement requires checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, so when Boris Johnson several times denied the need for such controls, the EU became frantic. But Michael Gove – the British co-chair of the joint committee for implementing the withdrawal agreement – has clarified that goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be controlled.The two sides remain far apart on the “level playing field”. The EU is worried that the British will gain an unfair advantage by undercutting its standards, for example on social and environmental protection. The most sensitive part of the playing field is limits on state aid for industry, with the UK refusing to say what kind of regime it wants. The other thorny issue is fish, with the two sides arguing over how many fish the EU should be able to catch in British waters and how often quotas should be reviewed.But the second reason for optimism is that there is still time for both sides to resolve these differences. The real deadline for a deal, so that MEPs have time to ratify it by year-end, is mid-October.Third, Covid-19 has increased the chances of a deal. The British government’s handling of the pandemic has led to questions about its competence. If the year ended with no deal, chaos at borders, disrupted supply chains and food shortages, there would be still more questions. That is why Boris Johnson may at the last minute prove as flexible as he did last October, when he accepted a border down the Irish Sea in the withdrawal agreement, having promised that he never would.A fourth reason is that no deal and its consequences would boost support for the SNP in next May’s Scottish elections. The SNP is already on course for a majority, but the bigger its vote, the harder it will be for Johnson to block another referendum on independence. Rather late in the day, No 10 has woken up to the risk of the UK breaking up.Similarly, no deal would also impact Northern Ireland. Goods travelling from Great Britain to the region would have to pay tariffs, making the new border regime more complicated and uncomfortable for Northern Ireland.A fifth reason is that if no deal looms business leaders will squeal. They have said very little about Brexit in recent months, fearing that it would be counter-productive and incur the wrath of No 10. But they are counting on the government doing what it takes to secure a deal, and if by October it appears unwilling to do so, they will speak out. Public opinion may then start to worry about jobs.The Conservative party was close to big business from the time of Robert Peel’s leadership in the 1840s right up to Johnson becoming prime minister. The current distance is not sustainable for long, especially now that Labour has, in Keir Starmer, a leader who is sympathetic to business.Johnson’s government is much more united on Brexit than that of Theresa May. No cabinet minister questions the pursuit of a hard Brexit (even if some backbenchers do, in private). But there are nuances among the people who count. In No 10, Dominic Cummings is apparently indifferent to whether there is a deal. Frost, who is an influential as anyone on Brexit, wants a deal, but only on his terms he expects the EU to make concessions. Like Frost, Johnson wants a deal and says he can live without one – but the prime minister gives the impression of being more willing to show flexibility. Gove is the keenest of the four to get an agreement – perhaps because, being responsible for no-deal preparations, he has thought through the implications.If Frost and Barnier can strike a bargain, it will lead to a much harder and more disruptive Brexit than most Britons imagine. Manufacturers will suffer friction at the border, service firms will be barred from the single market and employers will find it harder to hire workers.The macro-economic difference between the Canada-style free trade agreement (FTA) that Johnson envisages and no deal is not immense. Some leavers therefore argue that the UK might as well go for the full-blown sovereignty and simplicity of no deal.That would be a mistake. The tariffs that a “WTO terms” Brexit would entail would cripple sectors such car-making and livestock farming. And the EU might not recognise British financial regulations as “equivalent” or data privacy rules as “adequate” – thus hitting financial services, police cooperation and tech firms.But the biggest impact of no deal would be political. An acrimonious end to the transition would hit economic confidence and make it very hard for the UK and the EU to build close cooperation on trade or security for years to come. Although a thin FTA would harm the UK economically, it could be an interim measure. In the long run, when emotions over Brexit have subsided – when leavers no longer suspect remainers of trying to block it, and EU governments have stopped fearing that a slash-and-burn UK economy will outperform them – rational actors on both sides may see the benefit of closer economic, political and security cooperation.Britain will not rejoin the EU any time soon but it could move away from “Canada” towards something more like “Norway” or “Switzerland”. The advent of a Labour government would hasten that process.• Charles Grant is the director of the Centre for European Reform"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Call for donor countries to build climate change resilience into Covid-19 recovery plansS\u0026atildeo Paulo Letter: Jungle destruction prompts global pressure but makes little impactEcocide \u0026ndash the deliberate destruction of ecosystems \u0026ndash must be seen as the worst crime against humanity and nature"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4315575.1595923000!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plans to extend luas to finglas to bring 30 000 within 1km of green line","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLuas to be extended from Broombridge to Charlestown. Photograph Nick BradshawThe Plans for the extension of the Luas Green line to Finglas, which will put the north Dublin suburb within 30 minutes travel time of the city centre, have been released for public consultation.The proposed route will see the Green line extended from Broombridge in Cabra to Charlestown north of Finglas Village with four additional stops and two new bridges.The 4km extension will bring an additional 30,000 people within 1km of the Luas line, the National Transport Authority (NTA) said. However, it is likely to be another decade before the new line opens to passengers.The cross-city Luas line – the extension of the Green line from St Stephen’s Green to Broombridge – was designed a decade ago to allow a future extension to Finglas. Luas lines to Bray, Lucan, the Poolbeg peninsula, and Finglas were included in the 2016 NTA transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, but the Finglas line is the only route to reach the selection stage.The route, starting at the current Broombridge terminus, would require the construction of a new bridge across the Royal Canal and existing rail line at Ashtown, followed by second bridge just 300m later at Tolka Valley Park to cross the Tolka River. The first stop would be at St Helena’s Road south of Finglas Village. The next stop would be in Finglas Village, the third stop would be at Mellowes Park north of Finglas, with the new terminus at St Margaret’s Road at the Charlestown shopping centre.The route was chosen from a short list of four options and is the most direct alignment from the Broombridge to Finglas. Much of the route will pass through parklands, but “some acquisition of private land will be required”, the NTA said. The route will run along an “attractive grass track” through the parks the NTA said and a new cyclepath will be built alongside the tram line.A park-and-ride facility will be developed at Charlestown and passengers can change to the Maynooth and docklands rail services at Broombridge where the railway station and Luas stops are co-located."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockWhat the PUP is going on?Quite. Let’s start at the beginning: The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is the €350 a week enhanced social welfare benefit for anyone who lost their job due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The scheme has been extended until April but the Government will cut the payment from September, close it to new applicants and taper the payments depending on whatrecipients earned pre-Covid. It’s being paid to more than a quarter of a million people (down from almost 600,000 people in May). So why is it in the news now? Sunday’s edition of the Business Post reported that some 104 people have had their PUP cut off because they were found to be boarding a flight abroad in breach of rules another 44 people have had other payments, such as jobseeker’s allowance, cut for the same reason. Can’t people on unemployment benefits travel?Historically, this has been the case you were allowed two weeks in any calendar year for a holiday, without losing your welfare entitlement. However, the Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys, introduced a new rule two weeks ago stating that the holiday must be “in accordance with the Covid-19 General Travel Advisory in operation by the Department of Foreign Affairs”. In cases whereby people need to travel overseas for essential reasons, the Department of Social Protection will continue to pay the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) to these recipients. Examples of this would be travelling abroad due to bereavement or to care for a sick family relative, according to the Department. It said the PUP is not paid to people who are leaving the country to reside elsewhere or who go on holidays abroad. Neither is the payment paid to iniduals during a 14 day quarantine period. Who does this apply to?There was some confusion as to whether the restriction applied to those on PUP alone or on jobseekers, not helped by Táiniste Leo Varadkar stating on Sunday that those on jobseekers allowance are “allowed to take a break away of up to two weeks”. However, this appears not to be the case on Monday, Ms Humphreys said that this flexibilty has been “temporarily suspended” - advice put up on Gov.ie on Sunday, and updated on Monday, states that holiday periods for Jobseeker’s payments have been suspended and will not be made to anyone who travels abroad. According to the Department the rules apply to people on the PUP and Jobseeker’s payments “as the Department of Social Protection temporarily suspended the normal two week holiday period for jobseekers”Even to a green list country?That is not clear the statutory instrument introduced by Ms Humphreys refers to the “general travel advisory”. The Department of Foreign Affairs website states that its advice is against non-essential travel overseas but since the introduction of the Green List “travel to a very limited set of locations is exempted”, and non-essential travel can resume with normal precautions, or a so-called “green” rating. The Department said the green list is “not a list of holiday destinations”.Have the airports been passing passenger information to the Government?Again, Mr Varadkar’s appearance on The Week in Politics caused some confusion when he said the Department of Social Protection “gets information from the airports” - this caused concerns about data protection and privacy, and prompted Dublin Airport to clarify this morning that it doesn’t share data with third party agencies. The Department said checks involve inspectors speaking directly to passengers under legislation passed in 2005 and 2012.Are gardaí allowed to ask passengers for this information?Gardaí can demand your name and address if they have a reasonable suspicion you have committed a road traffic or public order offence. They can also demand the name and address of someone suspected of breaching a penal provision of the coronvirus legislation. Most of these penal provision have now been repealed. It appears as if social welfare payments conditions are not considered penal provisions.\u0026nbspBut gardaí have no general power to demand a name and address. They can request one however and, in practice most people provide it. Sources say most people stopped at the airports were simply requested to give their names, addresses and PPS numbers and they complied (perhaps not being aware that they had a choice).Are there any concerns about all this?In a word, yes. In the first instance, several people have questioned whether it is fair to cut someone’s dole for going on holidays, even if that’s against the travel advice. It is worth pointing out that hundreds of thousands of civil and public servants are required to take leave, including unpaid leave, if they need to quarantine after travel, even if working from home. But civil liberties activists and lawyers are asking wider questions about whether the statutory instrument introduced by the Minister might be on legally shaky ground. According to Liam Herrick, executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, there is a potential weakness in how the regulations are constructed. This, he says, is because the statutory instrument relies on the travel advisory - but that is, as the name suggests, just advice. “It seems to be grounded on, or give legal status to, something that isn’t the law, which is the travel advice.”Mr Quill also argues that the Government did not do enough to inform people of the change when it was introduced on 10th July, that could also weaken their case for enforcing the rule, as people would have formed a legitimate expectation they could travel and the normal rules, ie that they could do so for two weeks without their payment being impacted. Have the rules around qualifying for the PUP changed?It’s not clear how, or whether, there’s a link between this and the travel question, but again, comments by Mr Varadkar on Sunday raised this issue. The Táiniste said someone had to be “genuinely seeking work” to receive the PUP. This is now listed as a condition for eligibility on the Gov.ie website, but archived versions of the page show that as recently as last Wednesday, it wasn’t. Also, the Irish language version of the site doesn’t list it as a condition. On Monday MS Humphreys confirmed that some people in receipt of PUP should start looking for work as they might not be able to return to their former job. The Department has been asked to clarify this.

Photograph: Tom FlemmingFlickrThe Shelbourne Hotel has taken down two statues of manacled slave girls which have stood outside the hotel for the last 153 years.The statues were removed on Monday as a result of the Black Lives Matter protests, which have highlighted the number of statues to slaves or slave owners in cities around the world.Four bronze statues were commissioned by the Shelbourne Hotel’s original owner in 1867. They depict two Nubian princesses from east Africa and their slave girls holding torches.The statues were cast in bronze and commissioned from the studios of MM Barbezat of Paris.The Shelbourne Hotel, which has been situated on St Stephen’s Green since 1824, removed them on Monday in line with the decision by other bodies and local authorities to remove states relating to the slave trade.In a statement, the hotel said it removed the statues on Monday and the removal had been planned for “some time now”.The decision was taken in “light of recent world events”, although it did not elaborate on whether the decision was taken unilaterally or under pressure from outside sources.The Shelbourne Hotel is now working with Irish Heritage on plans for a suitable replacement “that are in line with the heritage and values of the property. We will share further information in due course”.The five-star hotel underwent a €40 million renovation programme between 2005 and 2007 and was closed for 18 months.

Photograph: iStockTeachers have cast doubt over whether schools will be able to reopen next month.The Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland (Asti) said it has a “mighty task” ahead of it to get students back within weeks.Deirdre Mac Donald, Asti president, said on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland she was “not confident” the Government’s plan for reopening schools can be put in place within the time frame outlined.“It is the logistics of it,” she said. “Some schools will need more changes to the school infrastructure, or maybe have to get in extra portacabins or space that is available in a nearby hall or something like that.”Ms Mac Donald also warned that getting the 1,000 promised extra teachers, as well as panels of supply teachers in place, “is no small task either”.Minister for Education Norma Foley said the recruits would be drawn from a “variety of pools or strands” including from 1,300 teachers who were already job-sharing in secondary schools. Limits on the number of hours a job-sharing teacher can work are to be lifted.Schools will also be looking to more than 2,000 secondary teachers registered but not teaching “for a variety of reasons” and more than 300 teachers newly qualified and trained this year in the UK, Ms Foley said.“I have every confidence they can be in place in time, in the next number of weeks.”More than 1,000 additional secondary school teachers are to be hired as part of plans announced by the Government to reopen schools at the end of August.A significant funding package of more than €375 million to support schools reopening was signed off at a Cabinet meeting on Monday.Under the plans, extra teachers will be hired to allow some schools to split larger classes to adhere to physical distancing rules of one metre between desks.While she expected significant numbers to be drawn from existing part-time teachers, the Asti president said few would be encouraged to come out of retirement.Ms Mac Donald also suggested a staggered return to schools would be better than everyone arriving back “in big bang theory on one day”.“Everyone has to get used to this new regime,” she said. “Everybody will need their day to get in, see the place, how it works — it is a very different place from September of any other year.”Supply teachers need to be assigned to a school, rather than several schools, she added, to keep “as closed a school regime” as possible.Smaller schoolsMs Foley has urged smaller schools around the country to “reimagine” their space so pupils and staff can safely return under Government guidelines within weeks.Under the roadmap for reopening schools, every primary school class is a “bubble”and smaller groupings or “pods” within the bubble will be distanced one metre apart. Pupils within the pods will also have to stay one metre apart.Ms Foley said €75 million is available as part of a minor works programme to help schools “declutter classrooms, remove all unnecessary furniture and maximise space”.Schools should look at “general purpose areas, assembly areas and reimagine how those spaces can be used to meet the needs of classes at a given time,” she added.“I have confidence that schools will have the potential and certainly have the financial resources to reimagine and to reconfigure spaces where required.”On the plan to roll out piloted substitute teacher panels nationwide, Ms Foley said supply teachers on a year-long contract “will be shared among a small number of schools within a particular location”.On concerns that supply teachers switching between schools risks spreading coronavirus, Ms Foley said: “It will be on a very, very limited basis.”While schools have “autonomy” to meet their own needs, the Minister said they should all be open “as normal at the end of August, early September as it was in the past.”“There is always within schools a latitude to decide what exactly will be their opening day – whether it is the 27th of August or the 25th of August or the 1st September,” she said.“That latitude within a couple of days remains, but in the main what I am saying is schools will open as normal at the end of August, early September.”Weeks-long delaysSome schools may be hit with weeks-long delays in reopening, John McGowan, general secretary of Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI), has said.While every effort will be made to adhere to the Government’s timeline for opening school gates next month or early September at the latest, it is likely “for local reasons that simply won’t be possible” for some schools, he said.“Schools may still be in the business of getting ready to return. In those circumstances, pragmatism has to win out, the school has to be given time to get itself ready.”Some schools may consider a staggered return of students, such as taking in first-year pupils for a short induction period, or incoming sixth years to reintegrate them, according to Mr McGowan.“Hard and fast statements and hard and fast rules on this are unhelpful in the current circumstances,” he said.Mr McGowan suggested schools where work is needed to allow for social distancing could suffer setbacks with delays in getting contractors.“If schools are not made ready on the button, pragmatism has to apply, “ he added.Mr McGowan said he would be surprised if there were weeks-long delays for most schools “but in some local circumstances that can’t be ruled out.”On plans to hire more than 1,000 new teaching staff, Mr McGowan told RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney it will be “very difficult” but he added it is “necessary”.While part-time staff and those on job shares could have their hours upped, he suggested there were several hundred students in their second year of professional master of education qualification, who are Garda vetted and registered with the Teaching Council, who could also be targeted.Also, those on a career break, whose plans may have gone awry because of the crisis, might be interested in returning to work.It was “wistful and nostalgic” to suggest teachers working overseas might return to Ireland, he said, adding that those abroad were there because of pay disparity at home, saving for a home-loan deposit or because they have a permanent full-time post.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Harry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleNajib may face decades in jail after conviction linked to multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandalGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

The report is notorious for predicting a “reasonable worst-case scenario” of 510,000 deaths. But it made another important point which is often overlooked. A lockdown would only save a significant number of lives if it was kept in place indefinitely, until there was a vaccine, “which could be 18 months or more”. Otherwise, the virus would simply rebound, probably worse than ever, after it was lifted.Professor Ferguson’s team had previously put the point like this. Aggressive isolation policies “merely push all transmission to the period after they are lifted, giving a delay but no substantial reduction in either peak incidence or overall attack rate”. The current spikes in countries that have lifted lockdowns, such as Spain, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong, bear this out. Some of them had longer and stricter lockdowns than we did.It follows that, as far as the lockdown was concerned, there were only ever three coherent options. Option one was to have no lockdown. Option two was to have an indefinite lockdown, putting our whole national life into cold storage for the duration at unimaginable cost. Option three, which the Government chose, was to have a lockdown for long enough to allow the intensive care capacity of the NHS to catch up. In the event it caught up within a month.The Government lifted the lockdown in June, six to eight weeks after it had lost any justification even by its own logic. But let us declare a truce on whether it was imposed too early or lifted too late. The question now is what happens next.The Government’s position appears to be that the famous R-number can be kept below 1 without a lockdown but with social distancing. Some epidemiologists agree with this. Others do not. I do not propose to venture into those murky waters. But assuming that the Government is right, there are some awkward issues to be confronted.One is that if the R-number can be kept below 1 with social distancing alone, then we could have done it in March instead of locking down. This is not hindsight. It is what Sweden did. It is fashionable to rubbish the Swedish approach. But their deaths per million of population are substantially lower than ours. Their hospitals were never overwhelmed. They never closed their schools. The predicted damage to their economy is about half of ours.The most awkward question, however, is about the exit route. Assuming that social distancing can keep transmission of the disease low, it has to be kept in place indefinitely until there is a vaccine. What does this mean for our world?Physical proximity to other people is not some sort of optional extra which can be ironed out of our culture. It is fundamental to our humanity. Conversation round a table, friendship, love and tears, children at play, most educational activity, depend on physical proximity. Our whole transport infrastructure, the buildings in which we work, play and eat out, depend on our being close together. With social distancing, physical cooperation becomes impossible. The social dimension of work all but disappears. The House of Commons, a great national forum in the crowded chamber, is reduced to a poor phone-in programme in a half-empty space. With social distancing there is no crowd around the bar, no singing at weddings, no orchestras or choirs, no theatre, no sport, no live audiences – in short, no collective activities, only the dismal solitude of the electronic screen. We have surrendered our liberty to the virus. Are we to surrender our humanity as well?Masks, by comparison, are a minor issue. They are uncomfortable and depersonalising. They conflict with a basic instinct of Western society to interact visually, showing our faces. But if they encourage people to come out and live together again or to send their children to school, that can only be good. People will soon tire of them.The brutal reality is the same, masks or no masks. We are going to have to live with Covid-19 whether we like it or not, unless and until there is an effective vaccine. And not just with Covid-19.Shocking? Perhaps. But only because in Europe we have had a false sense of security for so long. In the last two decades there have been Mers and Sars. Before that there were Asian flu, Hong Kong flu, H1N1, and non-respiratory epidemic diseases like HIV, Ebola and Zika. All of them had higher case mortality than Covid-19. But, apart from HIV, they barely touched Europe.This seems likely to change. International movement of people and other organisms is increasing. A major UK pandemic has been top of the National Risk Register since it was first published in 2008. It estimates that a new strain of flu could cause between 50,000 and 750,000 additional deaths in the UK and that emerging diseases, usually originating in animals, are a growing threat whose impact is unpredictable but may be very high.Covid-19 is a serious disease, but historically it is at the bottom end of the scale. For any one under 50 the risk of death is tiny, less than for seasonal flu. In the great majority of cases the symptoms are mild or non-existent. Our ancestors lived with far worse epidemic diseases without rushing to put their heads in a bag. In other parts of the world they still do (world-wide, tuberculosis kills many more than Covid-19).We all need to make our own personal risk assessments in the light of our age and state of health and the sort of activities in which we engage. For some people, social distancing will remain a sensible precaution. The rest of us should respect their choice but drop it and get on with our lives. We cannot keep running away.Jonathan Sumption is a former Justice of the Supreme Court and was BBC Reith Lecturer for 2019More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"church blamed frances coronavirus epidemic","story":"As an evangelical pastor in Mulhouse, eastern France, Samuel Peterschmitt has spent most of his life spreading the good word.For the past four months, he has been fighting allegations his Open Door church carelessly sowed death.“People need scapegoats,” he sighed.Mr Peterschmitt, 55, was speaking from the vast hall of a former supermarket in the poor, multicultural suburb of Bourtzwiller, which he transformed into a “super church” able to house a burgeoning congregation twice a week.His “crime”? Holding an annual mass gathering of fasting and prayer from February 17 to 21 many branded the supercluster that turned Mulhouse into France’s Covid ground zero and the country into one of the world’s worst hit.For five days, around 2,200 people from around mainland and overseas France, neighbouring Switzerland and Germany and even Burkina Faso sang gospel and clasped hands.“We’re going to celebrate the Lord! Are you feeling the joy tonight?,” the charismatic pastor asked as they prayed for a miracle cure from ailments. Little did he know that the coronavirus had also entered the building and that almost his entire flock would be infected, 80 hospitalised and 31 die from the disease.When followers returned home, they unleashed what one top health official called a “viral nuclear bomb” whose fallout was felt around France.The health minister dubbed it France’s “flipping point”. Its scientific council said without it, the country would be on a par with Germany - only 15 minutes away for 45,000 cross-border commuters but which suffered a third as many deaths.Twisting the knife, the state prefect of the Grand Est region, Josiane Chevalier, accused the church of failing to respect basic “social distancing measures: in short, everything you shouldn’t do”.The claims triggered torrents of hate mail. One of hundreds of messages read: “Thanks again for the French pandemic. We know who you are”.“The main culprit should have died so that this sect could answer for all the evil it has inflicted on Mulhouse!,” read another.Joining his hands, Mr Peterschmitt said: “We have received calls on social media to ‘gun him down with a Kalashnikov’ or ‘burn the church’. A colleague even received death threats at work.”Returning to the four corners of France, believers who fell ill said they were ostracised.Antoinette, a 70-year-old grandmother who lives on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, said she could not be fully identified as believers had been stigmatised by people outside the church for spreading the virus.“People have pointed their finger at me. They need a scapegoat, she said.Indeed, there is mounting evidence that the disease was already spreading relentlessly in the region before the gathering and that French health authorities had failed to pick up far earlier warning signs of impending disaster.President Emmanuel Macron gave a speech barely 200 yards from the church that very week. “He was shaking hands and taking selfies for an hour and a half,” said local shopkeeper Simsek Meleki, 40. \u0027Now people joke that Macron brought the virus with him.”Mr Peterschmitt asked: “How do expect us to know there was a risk if the President of France wasn’t aware of it?Two recent studies, one on chest X-rays in nearby Colmar, another quizzing 3,300 locals, suggest that that the first cases date back to November and that the epidemic had already taken off by mid-February in the area.Laurent Gerbaud, an epidemiologist at Clermont-Ferrand university hospital, said the findings suggested health authorities had failed to detect early warning signals.  “We have a woefully centralised bureaucracy incapable of receiving information from the ground up,” he said.All that said, there was little doubt, he added, that the church gathering turbo-charged contamination in France.Nobody felt ill during the event, but the following week, the pastor came down with flu-like symptoms and by Sunday, at least 800 people didn’t show up to church.On March 2, his son Jonathan tested positive and warned local health authorities about the gathering. That very same day, the first Covid patient was admitted to intensive care in Mulhouse’s Emile-Muller hospital.Joy Mootien, 54, chief consultant at the hospital’s medical intensive care unit remembered his patient zero well.“He was lying in his bed with breathing difficulties. When I saw the chest X-ray, I instinctively grabbed my mask,” he recalled. His family said he had not travelled recently but his wife did mention a large church gathering.“When I heard how big it was, I knew we were in trouble.”That night, Patrick Vogt, 64, a doctor fielding emergency calls in Mulhouse, witnessed the tidal wave.“More than 1,000 people rang in with such symptoms. It was frightening. We weren’t prepared here or in France,” he said. Despite the flood, state authorities calmly announced just six cases in the region the following day.“There was a chasm between what we were seeing on the ground and the official claims the virus was contained,” said Mr Vogt. “We lost two weeks pinpointing the church cluster,” he claimed.On March 5, gasping for air, Mr Peterschmitt was hospitalised. “I felt like a candle in the wind and thought my final hour had come. I was quite calm,” he said. Some 18 members of his family were struck down.That evening, Jean Rottner, 53, a casualty doctor and president of France’s Grand Est region sent a text message to President Emmanuel Macron.“I told him: ‘Watch out, what is happening here is not in line with the discourse we’re hearing in France. Please understand we’re in the midst of an epidemic.” In two days, the number of local cases multiplied by eight.French pride in its globally lauded public health took a huge knock when it realised that Germany was coping far better. Mr Rottner said this was partly down to mass testing, better communication between GPs and hospitals and far more intensive care beds - some 20,000 to France’s 5,000 at the start of the crisis.“But also we had this very particular cluster in Mulhouse which led to a brutal viral explosion. Germany didn’t have to deal with a problem of that magnitude.”At the hospital, very quickly all ICUs were full.“We were not on the front line, we were the front line,” said Marc Noizet, head of A\u0026ampE and emergency services.As critical patients kept arriving, soldiers were dispatched to construct a field hospital in the hospital car park with another 30 beds.Patients were ferried by helicopter to surrounding hospitals, then by plane and specially medicalised TGV fast trains to less affected regions of France. Others were sent to neighbouring Switzerland, Germany, as well as Luxemburg and Austria, whose hospitals were never underwater.In town, taxi driver Salah Aitabbes, 55, recalled: “It was like a science fiction movie with helicopters coming and going, the wail of ambulance sirens, empty streets and hearses.”A few hundred yards from the Open Door Church, Brigitte Ritz’s undertaker business was overwhelmed.“When you work with death, you tame your fear but this was different,” she said, arranging plastic flowers.“The funerary centre had coffins piled up with the air conditioning on full blast. When that was full, they were put in a special refrigerated hangar,” she said.Four months later, the death toll in the Grand Est region’s hospitals from Covid-19 is 3,383 with 1,809 more deaths in nursing homes. France, meanwhile, has just surpassed the 30,000 deaths mark.Many who did pull through intensive care are still struggling to recover.Malika Fisli, an auxiliary nurse from Mulhouse, was plunged into an artificial coma mid-March and woke up in Brest, western France, two weeks later.Today, she has lung scarring that will take up to nine months to heal and requires daily physio to regain 16kg of lost muscle. “I get breathless and have palpitations,” she said.“I still don’t dare go into shops and get angry when I see groups of people without masks.”Mrs Fisli worked in a nursing home, many of which turned into silent death traps. On her floor alone, ten among 49 elderly residents died of the disease and half her colleagues fell ill.She suffers from flashbacks in which she runs towards a blinding light and can hear a man saying: “Unplug her”. “But doctor, she’s only 58 and has four children,” another, female, voice chimes in.It was no nightmare. “During the coma, I heard these things. Afterwards, I asked the nurse if it was true. She went pale and confirmed that it was. I owe her my life,” she said. “But I don’t blame the doctor, he was only doing his job.”Like Malika, Mulhouse - a town with a proud industrial past that saw it dubbed the “French Manchester” - is slowly healing.“We were, without doubt, France’s ground zero,” said Mr Rottner, the Grand Est president.“We all know people who died, families that were affected. We won’t forget that. But we know our challenge is to shed this image of a region that was seriously hit by this disease and show that we can recover.”Others said it was high time to turn the page.“I’m fed up with Mulhouse being singled out as a pestilential city,” said Jean-Claude, a train conductor. “The truth is that for most of us it wasn’t as catastrophic as all that and certainly no worse than in Paris,” he said.As locals return to cafes, bars and restaurants, French health officials are fretting about an uptick in infections with the “R number”, which reflects infection rates, now above one in most regions. But ironically, the only one today below that dangerous watermark is the Grand Est.Back in his empty church, Mr Peterschmitt checked hand gel and spacing between chairs that have quartered capacity to 600.After weeks of online worship from his living room, he was finally about to meet the faithful in the flesh for the first time since that fateful gathering.Still weakened from his illness, he said he was worried about the future.“We’re in a very sensitive area here. What if a madman passed by and shot followers during the next worship?,” he asked.“Human beings are predators for their own kind. All this proves I was right to be a pastor and evangelist. Rousseau said, \u0027man is good but society corrupts him\u0027. The bible says, \u0027the heart of man is bad and society is simply its reflection.\u0027”“We are guilty of nothing. We were a fire in a forest already burning.”Despite his fears, he said he was looking forward to reconnecting with his flock.“I will tell them two things: how happy I am to see them again and to take heart: we can’t keep looking in the rear mirror. Life goes on.’”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must slim many nurses fat","story":"Shortly after reading Matt Hancock’s article about combatting obesity in yesterday’s paper, I emerged from a café to find my way virtually blocked by an enormously wide, youngish woman in a nurse’s uniform. It was a vivid reminder of a general fact about the National Health Service: many of its staff are fat.That matters, not only for the health of the NHS staff involved, but also for the effectiveness of any anti-obesity campaign. If the public are being urged to lose weight, they will not take the message seriously if they notice that a substantial proportion of those caring for them are not doing so. It reminds me of the days when lots of doctors still smoked.In his article, the Health Secretary also mentioned “stark inequalities in our nation’s health”. These are apparent within NHS staff. Sightings of fat NHS doctors are definitely unusual these days. Nurses and ancillary staff, on the other hand, are often disproportionately tubby.Why should this be? My guess is that the NHS, as a collectivity, is not a very health-conscious employer. What sort of food is served to hospital staff? Are they discouraged from eating too many American-style muffins? Certainly most hospital food for patients remains fattening and unappetising. Most hospital public coffee-shops groan under the weight of buns and fizzy drinks.The Government justifies an anti-obesity campaign partly in terms of the need to “help protect the health service”. As with its coronavirus slogan, this gets the problem back to front.Obviously, all citizens should behave well towards the public services. There is something even more disgusting, for example, about rioters who attack police and emergency services rather than just lamp-posts or one another. But the public do not exist to look after the NHS. The NHS exists to look after us.It will be an evil day if our defective lifestyle choices ever count against us when receiving medical treatment. When the AIDS epidemic began in the 1980s, one chief constable said that AIDS victims were “swirling around in a cesspool of their own making”. Even if this had been true, it would not have justified rationing or withholding their treatment. Motorcyclists and riders get more head injuries than the average. Drunks suffer from far more ailments than the sober.All of us, even the most virtuous, create work for the NHS simply by being alive, especially if we have the impertinence to get old. Don’t let’s go down the slippery slope of judging patients on their moral worth.The good reason for slimming is that you, and those dear to you, will usually have a happier and healthier life as a result. The message should be as simple as that.Last night’s BBC Panorama programme, China’s Coronavirus Cover-up, laid out the story efficiently. There can surely be no reasonable doubt that the Chinese Communist Party reacted slowly and mendaciously to the appearance of the virus. The results were literally fatal for thousands, arguably for hundreds of thousands all over the world. The programme brought this home.Two things, however, worried me. Both of them arose from the testimony of the programme’s star witness, Professor Kwok-Yung Yuen, who was part of the first delegation of external medical experts allowed to visit Wuhan.Professor Yuen spoke well and seemed wholly honourable, but it occurred to me that he might have fallen into a trap laid by the regime. He was told by the Wuhan authorities, he said, that the city’s wet market had been completely cleaned up before his arrival and that samples of only some of the animals there had been preserved. The implication, accepted by the programme, was that evidence of the disease’s origin had been erased.There is an alternative explanation. If it is true, as the scientists Angus Dalgleish and Birger Sorensen have posited in their learned paper on the subject (see this column, June 6) that the killer virus originated not in the market but in the Wuhan lab, then the reason for destroying much of the “evidence” from the wet market was not that the truth lay there, but that it did not. The Chinese wanted people to believe that the market contained something important, when actually it did not. You could put it thus: another creature from the animal kingdom, as well as bats and pangolins, had been available in the market – red herrings.My other doubt concerned Professor Yuen’s assertion that there had been “some cover-up locally”. I bet there was but surely the key point is that there was more than some cover-up nationally, at the highest level.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel updates five new countries added fco travel corridor","story":"As of today, Slovenia is now on the list of countries Britons can visit without going into quarantine on returnQuarantine to be cut to 10 days for people arriving from Spain Holiday quarantine: Which country will be next?

We were one of the first hotels to open in the capital and have assiduously followed health and safety protocols for the benefit of our guests.

Outbreaks were expected to appear and are being detected early and are being controlled with an early response plan agreed with Spain’s regions. In areas with bigger outbreaks such as Barcelona, Lleida and Zaragoza, the respective Autonomous Communities (or regions) have taken very forceful measures with regards to social distancing, which will allow them to regain control.Of the new cases detected, more than half are asymptomatic, which demonstrates the screening work being carried out with more than 4 million PCR tests already having been carried out. It is also important to note that hospital pressure remains low acute beds are below 1,500 patients and critical beds are around 160.Finally, just to outline that the death rate in Spain remains very low patients deceased by Covid in the last seven days totals approximately 10 people. Safety is our number one priority and we hope that the UK travel advice is revised soon to help the travel sector that has invested so much resource to allow a safe and secure reopening.”Here\u0027s everything you need to know about the situation in Spain.So says Greg Dickinson, who visited a club in Amsterdam last Thursday.There was a very limited capacity, no more than 45 people, which was enough to feel atmospheric without being irresponsibly packed in the aftershock of a pandemic. Best of all, my friend and I could actually hear each other speak.I suppose what I’m really describing here is a makeshift, low-capacity bar with live music. There’s nuance to this, of course. Clubs can only stay alive if they are getting enough bodies through the door and buying drinks, so once it’s possible they will go back to capacity. Queues and crowds will and must return. But in the meantime, this is a form of clubbing I can get into.The daily statement from Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, the federal government agency and research institute responsible for disease control and prevention, last Friday made for disconcerting reading: “The number of newly submitted cases on Friday, July 24, 2020, at 815, is significantly higher than in the previous weeks,” it said.These numbers represent the sharpest spike since the middle of May. The report offers various reasons, ranging from larger celebrations in family and friend circles, increased leisure activities, to rises within workplaces, community and health facilities.A new testing facility at Dusseldorf AirportBut it also mentions returning travellers as a new cause, a point which is underlined by images circulating in the media of German tourists flouting social distancing rules in destinations such as Mallorca and Bulgaria.Read the full report here.Quarantine for people arriving from Spain and other countries with high levels of Covid-19 will be cut to 10 days under plans being finalised by ministers, Charles Hymas reports.The Government hopes to announce this week a new policy of testing arrivals from high-risk countries eight days after they land. If they test negative they will be allowed to come out of self-isolation two days later, reducing the mandatory quarantine period by four days.The move will cut almost an entire working week off the self-isolation requirement, and ministers hope it will help salvage the summer holiday season for some of those already booked on flights abroad.Read the full article here.A big day in the world of travel, yesterday.

We can but dream.\u0026nbspOther contenders quite obviously – and deservedly – include Olivia Colman in The Crown, Jodie Comer in Killing Eve and Viola Davis in How to Get Away with Murder. Huge category, this.Then there\u0027s also a chance for Reese Witherspoon in The Morning Show, too (could she get two nominations this year? Little Fires Everywhere is a big contender in the Limited Series category).Who else is there? Jennifer Aniston for The Morning Show, which will probably be named in a few categories.Let\u0027s stick with The Outsider. It didn\u0027t set the world alight, but Cynthia Erivo\u0027s performance was one of the year\u0027s\u0026nbspbest. Julianne Nicholson\u0027s too. A nomination for either would be a very good thing.Sterling K Brown is a dead cert for This Is Us, although new competition could rear its head in the form of Tobias Menzies for his role as Prince Phillip in The Crown. There\u0027s also Al Pacino for Hunters, which Amazon Prime Video has been trying to make happen for a while now, and Ben Mendelsohn for cult HBO show The Outsider.Who will join the Succession boys in the main acting category? Expect to see Jason Bateman (Ozark), Billy Porter (Pose) and Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul).A nod for The Handmaid\u0027s Tale wouldn\u0027t come as too much of a surprise, but the same cannot be said for Westworld, whose third season was... not as good as what\u0027s come before.Then, there are some of the\u0026nbspold regulars: The Crown, Better Call Saul, Ozark, Pose and This Is UsExpect nominations for *takes deep breath* Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin and Matthew Macfadyen – and, with any luck, Nicholas Braun and J Smith Cameron.Succession has had a hell of a year. It\u0026nbspseems everyone\u0027s now fully on board with the Roy family\u0027s antics – and it seems this will be reflected in the nominations.What shows are you talking about? I hear you ask.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

The dissident artist said: “What is happening in Xinjiang is a look into the future of what will happen to Hong Kong. China sees it as simply a matter of domestic policy to crack down on minority groups by the hundreds of thousands. Tibetans have also faced similar treatment. It has been this way for years.” He added: “The Hong Kong situation has shown us that this authoritarian society will never give any space for discussion or negotiation. It is simply incapable of communicating with those with different ideas or ideologies.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They have always been this way and as long as the communists exist will remain the same into the future,” he continued. “‘One Country, Two Systems’ was finished the moment China applied its national security law to Hong Kong. China violated its own promise. It is a society that is unreliable and cannot be negotiated with.”Ai Weiwei among top artists donating work to our campaign auctionWhen will the UK take action over China\u0027s abuse of Uighur Muslims?\u0027Virtually entire\u0027 clothing industry \u0027linked to Uighur forced labour\u0027The auction is raising money for The Felix Project. Founded by Justin Byam Shaw, the former chairman of The Independent, Felix is the largest food surplus distributor in the UK and our appeal beneficiary. Weiwei stressed the importance of ensuring people have enough to eat. “Sharing food is the most fundamental human gesture, beyond ideology or religion,” he said. “Food is essential. It has a much more profound meaning about how we understand ourselves and how we relate to our culture. But for those who lack necessary nutrition, it’s really a matter of human dignity. Too often that dignity is in a shattered state.“I have visited dozens of refugee camps around the world where people ate in unthinkable conditions,” he continued. “I remember seeing people wait in lines for hours simply for a cup of tea, people cooking over open flames without any tools. Sharing food is the most fundamental human gesture.How to support our campaignSince the pandemic, Weiwei has launched himself into artistic and humanitarian projects. “Every event that happens around me has an impact on my work. I would have no work without the emotions or consciousness raised by those events.” In June he raised over £1m selling face masks with his renowned motifs of sunflower seeds and a defiant middle finger to support the work of international humanitarian charities battling coronavirus. He has also produced three documentaries, one covering a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh and another about life in Wuhan amidst the pandemic.Weiwei is no stranger to engaging with significant events in the Middle Kingdom. In 2009 for example, the Chinese government finally revealed the official death toll from the Sichuan earthquake after Weiwei launched his own investigation. At Munich’s Haus der Kunst he created an artwork – Remembering – out of 9,000 school backpacks to commemorate the students who died when their poorly-built classrooms collapsed after the earthquake.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He dismissed his homeland’s reaction to the virus as “untrustworthy, opaque and in denial of responsibility from the very beginning”, continuing: “The casualties are clear and factual. The conclusion from this crisis is still unknown. Many countries still deny the truth or shy away from it.” While he rejects the increasingly popular suggestion of a “new cold war between China and the West”, he warns that — if the West does not have a clear strategy — it “will lose this competition”. Weiwei’s father Ai Qing was one of China’s most eminent literary figures. He fell out of favour with the regime and the family was exiled to Xinjiang in the far-west, where his father was forced to clean communal latrines. In 2015, Weiwei was finally granted a passport and permission to leave China. He now resides in Cambridge and has a studio in Berlin. Of his vision post-pandemic, he said: “Covid-19 compels us to consider fundamental questions. How will society continue to develop? In what way can we still protect humanity and prevent a repeat crisis, especially those that are not natural disasters but the product of hidden and misleading information and irrational thinking on many levels, across different societies?Who are the Uighur people and why do they face oppression by China?China set to block UK’s offer of citizenship to Hong Kong residentsUK scraps extradition treaty with Hong Kong over China’s crackdownAi Weiwei’s Small Plate With Flowers and other works from the Food For London Now auction are available until 30 July.

There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She planned it.”The -year-old, who did not receive payment for speaking to The Sun, has also reacted to the content.On Sunday, it was reported that Meghan and Harry had “rejected” the idea of getting help to protect her father, as their royal romance grew.He says he was also berated by Harry for co-operating with the press while in hospital recovering from heart surgery.From his home in Rosarito, Mexico, he said: “The fact the royals advised them to get me help and they refused to do it is incredible news.”A heartbroken Meghan, according to the book, sent her dad one final text the night before her wedding.He was due to walk his daughter down the aisle at Windsor Castle until it emerged that he posed for the photographs, which were sold to papers around the world.Yet Meghan was still desperate for him to attend.And Finding Freedom tells of how she left dozens of frantic messages for her dad — telling him a car would take him to Los Angeles airport so he could fly to London for the ceremony.But despite her “barrage of voicemails and texts”, he refused to get in the waiting vehicle.And he did not respond to messages after she called him “at least  times”.Mr Markle then began making a series of bizarre statements to the press and he eventually said the stress of dealing with the media had caused him to have a heart attack.Finally, he told her he would not be coming and only her mother Doria would be there. The book says: “If it wasn’t for Harry, Doria and her friends, Meghan herself says she wouldn’t have mentally got through it.”Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday newspaper for revealing the contents of a letter she wrote to her dad, claiming it was a breach of privacy.Mr Markle said he wanted to share the letter after its contents were publicly misrepresented in order to “vily” him.High Court legal papers revealed Meghan felt “unprotected” by the Royal Family while pregnant with son Archie and was unable to defend herself against  claims. Other private information, which would indicate the Sussexes must have been involved in the biography, includes details of voicemails Meghan sent to her dad and frosty conversations between Harry and William.It claims the Duke of Cambridge told his little brother not to rush things with “this girl” — a comment that allegedly sparked fury from a “p***ed off” Harry.The Duke of Sussex is then said to have moaned to a friend: “It’s a sick part of the society we live in today, and no one is doing anything about it.Where’s the positivity  Why is everyone so miserable and angry ”Meghan is quoted as telling a pal: “I gave up my entire le for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes.”In another extract, the book amazingly reveals how Harry was left anguished after reading comments online dubbing him a “disgrace to the Royal Family”.A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom.“This book is based on the authors’ own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their independent reporting.”Author Scobie, asked whether there had been off-the-record conversations with the royal couple, said: “You’ve read the book. There are no on-the-record interviews with the couple.”Pressed again, he replied: “No, my time around the couple is enough for me to know my subjects.”Scobie, , has previously been vocal about his elevated access to Harry and Meghan since his time as a royal reporter at Harper’s Bazaar magazine.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a full-scalesoon is not likely. That is not down to animosity... they have not yet reached what they were seeking to do.”  The biography also explains how Harry felt that the “old guard” at Buckingham Palace disliked Meghan. According to the book - which was written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand - the rt between Harry and his brother William was due to some of the Duke of Cambridges comments about Meghan.Prince William is said to have told his brother Harry: “Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl.”Prince Harry felt that his brother’s remark was “snobbish”, the authors write.However, despite the tensions between them Harry still asked William to be his best man at his wedding.Finding Freedom also revealed Prince Harry was the first one to say I love you, while detailing messages that Meghan sent her estranged father Thomas Markle in the lead up to her wedding.But despite the incredible level of detail released in the book, a spokesperson for the couple insisted they had not been involved in the book.They said in a statement: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom.This book is based on the authors own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting.And in an interview with The Times, author Omid Scobie carefully answered: The book doesnt claim to have any interviews with Harry and Meghan. And nor do we.When quizzed over whether the couple had given off record interviews, he added: No, and I think that you can tell from the reporting, my time around the couple is enough for me to know my subjects.Yet the detailed excerpts also revealed Meghans heartache over her father before her wedding to Prince Harry - saying she had sent a barrage of voicemails and messages to the -year-old.The book stated: The night before the wedding, she sent her father one last text. He did not reply.“Sitting in a bath later that night, FaceTiming with a friend, the bride-to-be said she had left her dad a final message, adding: ‘I can’t sit up all night just pressing send’.It was then claimed in the book that Harry and Meghan got secretly engaged on a trip to Botswana two months before telling the world.The biography also claims that Meghan had told a friend that she gave up her entire le for the Royal Family. She is said to have added: I was willing to do whatever it takes.Insiders claim that the Queen will be most affected by the new book.Speaking to Vanity Fair, a source close to the royal family said: “Its going to open old wounds at a time when everyone wanted to move on.“I think the person who will be most upset about it all is the Queen.”Finding Freedom is set to be released on August , but is already among the bestselling books on Amazon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They have been instrumental during testing to identy the fairest process, and are being used to quality assure the outputs. Centre assessment grades are the primary source of evidence to calculate grades for low entry subjects, small centres and those lacking historical data.“From the data that we have reviewed, we expect the majority of grades students receive will be the same as their centre assessment grades, reflecting the skills, professionalism and integrity of those involved.”Any student unable to receive a calculated grade, or who would like to improve their grade will have an opportunity to take exams again in the autumn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nora Zukauskaite, global head of marketing at Skin Proud, said: We were surprised to find people care so much about what others look like - especially those they donapost even know.

At Skin Proud we want to help everyone embrace their inner beauty and realise that what is seen on social media is often far from reality.  The study also found  per cent lack confidence because they feel there is a lot of pressure to look a certain way. And  per cent donapost feel secure in their own skin because their natural look is dferent to the image they portray of themselves on social media. Blemishes emerged as a common cause of the confidence crisis for a quarter of those polled, while nearly a fth will feel less confident because of acne.As a result,  per cent of female respondents said they put makeup on to feel attractive - suggesting they would not without it. The research also found women are more likely than men to filter their images for social media -  per cent of women compared to  per cent of men. The main reason for going filter-heavy was to edit out blemishes, although  per cent try and enhance features like their lips. More than a third will try and smooth out their skin, while a tenth will attempt to reduce the size of their nose.

Peter Ivory, , now faces a £, bill after claiming he did the right thing by following his dying brother Mickaposs wishes not to let the rest of the family get their hands on his £, fortune. He said Mick was adamant on his deathbed that his money should go to the hard-working poor and homeless because he disapproved of much of his family. After receiving tube driver Mickaposs £, fortune, Mr Ivory says he converted most of the £, that was left after expenses into gold coins, which he then handed out to the needy on the streets of Cambridge, the Isle of Wight and Scotland. But the High Court in London heard because the cash should legally have been split with other members of the family because Mick had not made a will. And now, after being told he committed a monumental breach of his duty as administrator of Mickaposs estate, he has been told by a judge to stump up the cash he owes his relatives. You may think you took a moral position but what you have actually done is deprive other people of money that is actually theirs, and that is not a moral position, said Judge Timothy Bowles. The decision means Mr Ivory, from Hendon, north west London, will have to hand over about £, to his brother Alan, £, to another brother John and £, to his nephew Michael. The court heard Mick died without making a will aged  in November  and that afterwards Peter handled his affairs and arranged the sale of his home in Wallington, Surrey.  Mickaposs estate consisted of the proceeds of sale of the house, his beloved Lurcher dog Lady and a collection of rare Osmond Family memorabilia, accumulated by his we, Pat, who died four years before him. Under normal intestacy laws, which apply when someone dies without making a will, Alan, John and Michael expected to share the money with Peter as Mickaposs surviving next of kin. But Peter told the court he had been holding his brotheraposs hand as he lay dying in hospital and that Mick had been adamant that his money should go to the poor, and not his family. Mick told me to keep it all and,I couldnapost keep it, to give it away, he said.  His whole plan was to make sure they didnapost get it. He said he passed on the memorabilia to the Osmonds fanclub, took in his late brotheraposs dog, handed out a few small gts to others, and then converted most of the rest to gold coins and travelled the country, handing out the fortune to those who needed it. It doesnapost take long to give it away, he said. The case ended up in court after a claim by brothers Alan and John, and nephew Michael, to their share of the estate, which they said Peter had no right to deprive them of.  When the dispute first blew up, Peter wrote to his brother Alan, saying that Mick made me promise not to give his well-earned moneythe rest of the family. In court, Peter accepted that what he did was against the law, but insisted he considered the rest of the family were entitled to nothing morally. Mick worked his whole le,  years on the underground, for that money. I couldnapost give them his money, he said. They didnapost sit holding his hand as he was dying. They didnapost hear what he said to me.  He told me what he wanted to do. I thought my responsibility was to follow my dying brotheraposs wishes. I made a mistake, but I didnapost make a mistake as far as my brother is concerned. Ordering that he hand over the cash to Alan, John and Michael, the judge told Peter he had committed a monumental breach of his duty as administrator of his brotheraposs estate. You knew that they had legal entitlements, but you decided that, because your brother had expressed certain wishes, you werenapost going to comply with the law, he said. What you have done - and have decided to do - is think aposI donapost think much of the people legally entitled to this money and so I am going to give it to someone apos.

There are fears the book could be the final nail in the coffin for the Sussexesapos relationship with other members of The Firm - with Thomas Markle now taking a swipe at the royal couple. He said: This is the worst time in the world to be whining. And in a further blow, he told The Sun: I love my daughter but I really don’t appreciate what she’s become right now. The book - by former royal correspondents Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand - alleges Meghan felt let down when her dad lied to her by denying he helped stage paparazzi photos prior to her wedding in May . A week before the big day, Kensington Palace officials heard the photo shoot was to be exposed in the press as having been staged. The book says palace communications staff and lawyers were moving to have publication stopped, as Meghan phoned her father.  Dad, we need to knowthis is true or not, because my team is going to try and stop this story from running -you are telling me itaposs fake, she reportedly told him. If they do that, theyaposre going out of their way to protect you, Dad. Youaposre telling me youaposre being victimised, right  Mr Markle had replied Of course, failing to admit he had participated in the staging of the photos, which were duly exposed as set-ups in the press the next day.  Despite his deception, Meghan had still wanted her father at her wedding. He ultimately did not attend, partly due to suffering a heart attack days before the event, which he blamed on the stresses of pressure from the media. The book gives further glimpses of Meghanaposs troubled relationship with Mr Markle, including a string of uned phone messages and texts from the former actress to her father in the days before her wedding. A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said the couple did not contribute to Finding Freedom, but he did not deny the content of published extracts.

After the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their plans to split earlier this year the royal household rushed into damage limitation mode. Courtiers proposed that Harry and Meghan undergo a probation period to test the waters of le beyond the firm, before deciding how to continue. When the compromise was offered to the Prince he initially tried to turn it down, opting instead for a aposclean breakapos. Harry had to be persuaded of the merits of the trial period, which he and Meghan are currently undertaking. However with the publication of the aposFinding Freedomapos biography on Meghan and Harry it is thought the couple have burned any bridges of ing to the royal fold.A source told MailOnline : He was adamantly opposed to the review process.According to the publication Harry did not like the idea because he feared it would lessen the impact of the announcement of his departure. He feared a trial period would lead to intense media speculation that they couldto the Firm.  A source reportedly close to the family said they would not rule out the possibility of Harry and Meghan ing. They did sound a note of caution however, suggesting that a aposfull-scalesoonapos was unlikely. That is not down to animosity or anything like that, the source told MailOnline. They have not yet reached what they were seeking to do. The insights into the royal split come following days of revelations sparked by a biography into the Sussexes.  Finding Freedom, written by royal authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, claims to have spoken to  sources about the couple. Such is the detail of the bookaposs revelations that some have suggested that Harry and Meghan played some part in its creation.

But it was another lockdown aposfirstapos for the Monarch when she attended a virtual unveiling of a new picture of her. Despite seeing Miriam Escofetaposs piece for the first time over camera, the Queen was very quick to spot a slight issue with the work - and she pointed it out straight away. The portrait, commissioned by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as a lasting tribute to Her Majestyaposs service to diplomacy, shows the Queen sitting on a gold chair next to a round table. A beautul bunch of lilac flowers are sitting on the table alongside a gold tea cup - but itaposs empty. The Queen saw the painting for the first time via her computer screen, before speaking to members of FCO staff about their work around the world during the coronavirus crisis.The virtual visit was hosted by Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under-secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs and head of the Diplomatic Service, who was joined by the artist for the unveiling. Ms Escofet told the Queen during the unveiling that she had included a hidden symbol in the painting - the insignia of the FCO - painted on to a tea cup.  The artist said afterwards: She seemed to react very positively to it. She was smiling, asking how long it took andI had any more projects on the go after this. When I explained certain elements of the painting, the tea cup, she made some amusing comments. She said aposbut thereaposs no tea in the cupapos. Ms Escofet explained some of the details in the painting, which was inspired partly by Holbeinaposs The Ambassadors and the anamorphic distortion technique used by Renaissance painters. As such, she said, she resolved to have a slightly surreal but appropriate element as something intriguing for people to stumble upon. She told the Queen she had settled on a tea cup, including the insignia of the FCO on the saucer and reflected in the cup itself.  The artist said: It felt really right to apply it to the tea cup. Suddenly this very humble object carries this symbolism representing the FCO and linking the portrait to its destination. I explained this to the Queen and she made this very humorous comment about how thereaposs no tea in the cup. I said Iaposm afraid the tea has been sacriced for the symbolism. The painting took seven months to complete, with the final stages finished in lockdown. Ms Escofet had two sittings with the Queen - one at Windsor where she spent around half-an-hour photographing the monarch and the second at Buckingham Palace to focus on her facial expressions. She was chosen on the recommendation of the National Portrait Gallery after she won the BP Portrait Award with a painting of her mother, which Sir Simon said had perfectly captured the luminosity and dignity of her subject.  The Palace had been shown a sketch of her plans for the Queenaposs portrait but had been very hands off and had not interfered, she said. The second sitting at Buckingham Palace came in February, shortly before the reality of the coronavirus pandemic hit the UK, with artist and subject even discussing the situation in Wuhan during their time together. Of the sittings, Ms Escofet said the intensely precious time flew by. Ms Escofet said: Sheaposs a very experienced sitter. Sheaposs fantastic. Sheaposs very much focused on giving you what you need. Sheaposs very present in the room and focused on the job in hand. She has a sense of humour there bubbling under the surface. She was very down to earth,thataposs not a silly thing to say.  In the first sitting I was asking about her experience with previous portraits and whether she had any particular favourites. I tried to tease it out of her, but she was very diplomatic. Because it was at Windsor, a plane flew by and she commented on the noise. The second time, I did most of the talking because I wanted to get a reaction from her face. The painting was unveiled over videocall, with Ms Escofet at the FCO where she mounted the portrait on her own easel with a cloth draped over it. As she and Sir Simon pulled the drape down, she said the Queen smiled and looked very pleased. On the challenges of painting the Queen, she said she had tried to capture the essence of the private monarch alongside the knowledge she was probably the most recognisable person in the world. She added: What I wasnapost expecting was her humour. Iaposm not saying sheaposs cracking jokes, but you can feel it. Thereaposs a real sharpness, a keenness, sheaposs really there, she really takes you in. I guess itaposs a wisdom. I really wanted to catch that essence of her in the portrait. Thataposs a quality that you only really feel when you meet someone. Sheaposs a very powerful, small person, and quite luminous. You can feel this le energy from her, itaposs very striking. That became very useful for me because it meant I could get almost an aura of regalness around her in what was actually trying to be a very humane portrait of her. Sir Simon said the FCO was delighted with the terric portrait. He added: Thereaposs truth and dignity and wisdom in the portrait. We are Her Majestyaposs diplomatic service. There is a bond between this organisation and the monarch. For people to be able to say that the Queen was interested and impressed with their work is a wonderful and really motivating thing. Also on the videocall was Sanjibita Tariang, who has worked for the FCO for  years and is regional consular development officer at the British Deputy High Commission Kolkata, India. She spoke about her role in repatriating more than , Britons after the pandemic struck. She told the Queen about the challenge of co-ordinating the journey of one woman, who made a five-day, ,km trip through a locked-down country to board a plane home.  Seeing the smiles when theyhome and they send you the picture with their family, thataposs what we work for. It makes it all worthwhile, she said. She [the Queen] asked a few questions but she was listening and you could see she was impressed. For me, itaposs a dream come true. I always dreamed that I would one day get to speak to the Queen. That was something really, really special to me. And then when your work is recognised after youaposve put in so much, that really means a lot. It really means everything to all the staff here. Aletheia Bligh-Flower, joint head of global health at the FCO, spoke during the videocall about collaborative work to develop a Covid- vaccine, support vulnerable countries and keep supply chains for PPE open. She said the Queen had been particularly interested in how quickly the FCO had mobilised and knew all about the recent Global Vaccine Summit she had been working on.

Due to her lung condition the -year-old had been shielding since the start of the coronavirus pandemic but when she developed the infection her family were told to take her to hospital after encouraging her to see a doctor. Margaret agreed and the her daughter went to Wrexham Maelor Hospital with her.Gail, who is a former nurse, told WalesOnline : “She was my best friend. I was very lucky to have her for  years of my le, some kids donapost have their mums but that should never have happened and I donapost want it to happen to anybody .“She didnapost want to go because she thought she would catch the virus. I said to her ‘you have to go Mum,  you are going to die’. I knew that she wasnapost very well. When I saw her I thought she had deteriorated and lost weight. I had to encourage my mum to go to the doctoraposs and she was petried of leaving the house. She kept saying ‘I will catch it, I will catch it’.” Margaret, who was from Connahaposs Quay, Clywd, was told she had pneumonia, not coronavirus, when she was admitted to hospital. “We were very fortunate to be able to see her at the doorway, cuddle her and tell her how much we loved her,” Gail said. When I walked in and saw her I knew that she wasnapost very well. My mum is  and suffers with COPD. when I saw her I thought she had deteriorated and lost weight. Margaret was given oxygen for several days and appeared to be on the mend until July .  “I got a phone call saying theyaposve got some good news and some bad news,” explained Gail. “They said the good news is she has passed all the tests and the bad news is she has been in contact with somebody who is positive for Covid. “I said aposoh my god, how the hell did that happen apos I was absolutely appalled.”There has been very little transmission within hospitals in most of Wales but Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has seen a large spike in hospital-based transmissions.Last week,  people caught the virus in hospitals when they were there for non-coronavirus reasons. The rest of Wales saw five. Gail claims instead of keeping her mum in to seeshe developed symptoms and tested positive, they discharged her.  She said this meant she also risked her own health by taking her mum home. “When they told me the news I thought I couldn’t leave her there,” said Gail. “The next minute the phone rings and itaposs my mum calling me crying saying she really wanted to come home. I went to get her and we both had a cry. “I took Mum home and to start with she was great but after a few days she went downhill and was a bit tired. “On Saturday, July , she was OK in the morning. I gave her food and tablets while keeping a distance and hand washing and using the antibacterial gel. “She asked for a salmon fish cake for lunch and by the time I had made it for her she had gone really downhill. I called the ambulance and they were here for about  minutes. She was very confused. “As she left for hospital I said ‘I love you Mum’ and she said ‘I love you too love and I will see you soon’.” On Sunday, July , Gail got a call from the hospital with the news that her mum had coronavirus.  “I had a phone call to say that mum had tested positive,” she said. “The next day I started to feel not good. The st was my th birthday and the next day I took a test myself and it came back positive.” On July , Gail was informed that her mother had died - meaning she had to both grieve for her beloved mum and fight the virus herself. The last time they had spoken was on Gail’s birthday a few days previously. Gail said: “When she rang on my birthday she said ‘Iaposm so sorry Iaposm not there for your birthday, when I come out Iaposm going to make it up to you - I hope you have a lovely day and Iaposm going to buy you a cake’.” Gail is furious that her mum, who had an underlying health condition, was exposed to the virus and was discharged when staff knew she may have coronavirus. “I canapost believe that I will never speak to her again,” Gail said. “She was my best friend. I was very lucky to have her for  years of my le, some kids donapost have their mums but that should never have happened and I donapost want it to happen to anybody .” "},{"url":null,"title":"terrified meghan markles telling comment","story":"NewsTerried Meghan Markles telling comment to friend after realisation about royal leIn their new book Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand have written about the le-changing night when Meghan Markle and Prince Harry found out their secret relationship was about to become publicShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am video paul-burrell-says-harry-meghan-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news terried-meghan-markles-telling-comment-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The prince flew to Canada to spend time with his new girlfriend, and the American actress stayed with him at his Kensington Palace cottage. But despite their best efforts, news of their relationship was soon leaked and they had just a few hours to prepare before it appeared on the front pages. In their new book Finding Freedom, which has been serialised by the Times ahead of its release next month, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand share details of what happened on the night the couple were told their game was up. They write: One night late in October in Toronto, Harry was happy, and so was Meghan. Until their received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. A tabloid was going to run with the story of their relationship. Their main worry was that her place would be besieged by photographers within  hours. They had little time to think, because there were only a couple of paparrazi in Toronto but it wouldnapost be long before photographers flew in from New York and LA, all hoping to get that first picture of the happy couple. The Duke was inundated with calls from his staff, many of them trying to get him toto London early as they were concerned about his slimmed down security team.  However, he refused to leave. Scobie and Durand claim that while Meghan was nervous about what was to come, she was also relieved as it meant she no longer had to lie to family and friends. They say that she got more than  messages from former friends and acquaintances looking for gossip. But the authors claim that the true extend of the fame that came with dating a royal was a huge shock to Meghan, and resulted in her sending one particularly worried message to a friend. They write: Prior to meeting Harry, the only times she experiences cameras were on a set or on a red carpet.

The measure would allow police to prevent certain people from entering the area. The illegal car meet, dubbed aposDMO Shutdownapos, on July  took place at JDK Autoworx garage. It saw the streets taken over by car enthusiasts, who were filmed performing dangerous stunts and driving at speed. Police received at least  calls from horried residents as they watched cars performing wheelies and burnouts on the streets. Other areas of Tameside have already been under close surveillance from police in recent weeks, following intelligence about a number of illegal raves.  More than , people attended a aposquarantine raveapos at Daisy Nook Country Park in neighbouring Oldham earlier in the year, where one man died following a suspected drug overdose. Another illegal rave was prevented by officers in Tameside, which had been due to take place on July . In a letter addressed to Andrew Gwynne, Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, police said they were aposlooking atapos a PSPO covering the whole of Tameside in light of recent events.  The banning order would give police the powers to fine, arrest or remove people from the areaofficers suspect they are there to attend an illegal event. Superintendent Jane Higham said: We are currently looking at a Public Space Protection Order for the whole of Tameside to prevent and enforce the compliance in the future around events of this type. Preventative work is key and once an event like this is up and running, getting them stopped is extremely dficult.  Supt Higham said the force had no prior intelligence about the car meet on July , despite the event having been advertised on social media  hours before. She said the scale of the event escalated quickly, with  vehicles arriving within the first  minutes of the meet. A man has since been interviewed by police in connection with the event. Mr Gwynne said he welcomed the news that police were considering the imposition of a Public Protection Order.  Mr Gwynne said: Any power that helps the police and local authorities to prevent the shut down of a community like Denton and the sheer chaos and disregard for the law we saw last week has to be welcomed. The exact details of what the PSPO would include have not yet been confirmed. Stockport already has a similar banning order in place. Mr Gwynne believes the order would give police the power to prevent people entering the boroughthey fear they are travelling to an illegal event.  He said: We have been looking at having an order to cover the whole borough of Tameside that would prevent any kind of illegal events from happening. It would give police sufficient powers to stop these events from happening in a way they were not able to before. If a PSPO had been in place when the car meet took place then police could have turned cars away. It just sends out another message that the people of Tameside are not happy for their community to be open for illegal activity.

Jessica has been inundated with voice mails from strangers making Wookiee roars for two weeks after their broke up turned bitter. But it seemed her bitter ex-boyfriendaposs prank backfired - as the Queensland mum told reporters she actually found it quite funny. Her former partneraposs Star Wars-themed plot involved an advertisement promising a chance to win for the aposbestapos Chewbacca impersonation. He plastered posters around Cairns in northern Queensland with a picture of Hans Soloaposs shaggy sidekick and his exaposs phone number after their three-year-relationship came to an end.The mum-of-three old News :This has got to be the most childish break-up Iaposve ever had.All he had to do was say aposI donapost love you anymore, I wanna move on. Unfortunately for Jessica, it seemed many Australians fancied they could do a winning Wookiee impression. Iaposm getting phone calls at really strange hours of the night about one oaposclock to about four oaposclock, eh, she told the broadcaster. I thought it was quite funny actually, I thought it was a good joke. But Jessica has since been growing sick of the constant phone calls waking up her kids in the small hours of the morning. She said she is keen for the Chewbacca roar contest to end. But her plight has been going viral in Australia, where fans of the prank on Twitter declared it the story of the year. Jessica told the Cairns Post she was annoyed that some people didnapost believe her.Someone called and said they thought it might have been done as a joke because they watchedput up the poster, she said. It hurts my feelings.  Jessica said while she initially found the prank funny, she was appealing to hopeful Wookiees to stop roaring down her phone line at am.  She got the police involved after her ex allegedly took his revenge even further- dumping his car with the tyres removed in the driveway of her house to block her in. The police got in contact with me and finally theyaposre going to do something about it, she told the far north newspaper.Jessica also claimed she had broken up with her ex after she logged into his Facebook and discovered he was sending messages to other women.But his prank in retaliation for her ditching him appears only to have reaffirmed her decision.

But what , this whole time, youaposve been doing it wrong. A video shared to TikTok has sparked a debate by claiming to reveal the aposcorrectapos way to tie your laces.It cites a  study by UC Berkely which says the most common way to secure your laces - the ‘bunny ear’ method - is the weakest style as it is based on a  knot.The study explains: “There are two ways to tie the common shoelace bow tie knot, and one is stronger than the other, but no one knows why. “The strong version of the knot is based on a square knot: two lace crossings of opposite handedness on top of each other. The weak version is based on a  knot the two lace crossings have the same handedness, causing the knot to twist instead of lying flat when tightened.” And although the study found that both of the knots fail in the same way, it makes clear that one knot is stronger than the other. In the clip the woman demonstrates how you should be tying your shoes. She starts by crossing the left lace over the right lace, before making a loop on the right hand side. Then you should place the left loop around that side and pull it through. The voiceover says: “You want your laces to lie perpendicular to your shoe, not parallel.” Since being posted it has received , likes and thousands of comments debating which way was best. One said: “Isn’t that how everyone does it ” "},{"url":null,"title":"man 20 put kitten jar","story":"NewsMan, , put kitten in jar and watched it gasp for air in sick Instagram videoWARNING DISTRESSING IMAGES Yuri Soroka, from Sokal, western Ukraine, insisted his prank was just an innocent game as he let the kitten out unharmed, however animal rights activists were disgusted by the videoShareByRoksana PanashchukMatthew Dresch:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video man-put-kitten-jar-canned-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news man--put-kitten-jar-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The footage caused huge public outrage and caught the attention of the police who found and detained Soroka within a few hours. Police spokesman Ivan Sheremet commented: We seized the suspectaposs smartphone which he used to film the video and sent it along with other evidence for examinations. Officers launched a criminal case for animal cruelty against Soroka, who faces up to three years in prisonfound guilty. Speaking with local media, the man said: I donapost understand why to make a fuss. It was just an innocent game. I let the kitten out in a few minutes. It was not hurt. Animal rights activists took Shurik away from its cruel owner following the incident. Volunteer Kristina Chaparina, who is currently taking care of Shurik, said: That man put the kitten, who trusted him, into the jar and watched it gasping for air. The man should be severely punished for what he did. The kitten was terried and inert due to its ordeal. It took several days for Shurik to recover. Now its appetite has improved and it became more active. We are looking for a new caring family for it.

The North Korean leader had given the commemorative pistols to his leading commanding officers in a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement, signed on July  . The pistols, known as “Paektusan”, were conferred by the leader to dozens of senior officers, who pledged their loyalty to him, state media reported. They were pictured surrounding the leader with the weapons held in front of their chests. The ceasefire, signed after three years of war, left the peninsula ided and many families split by the so-called Demilitarized Zonebetween North and South Korea. Elsewhere, North Korean citizens have reportedly been forced to eat terrapins due to food shortages.The hermit kingdom has found itself in the grips of famine since tightening its borders even more than usual due to the  coronavirus  pandemic.The move has tipped many citizens over the edge into destitution, with millions having already been on the breadline for years due to governmental mismanagement and UN sanctions. North Korean trade has been targeted due to Kim Jong Unaposs drive for nuclear weapons. In a bid to help its citizens stave their hunger, the governmentaposs website Naenara has advised people to eat terrapins.

That’s a good thing.”United#s starting line-up was: Siegrist, L Smith, Powers, Connolly, Pawlett, C Smith, Robson, Butcher, Harkes, Shankland and Mochrie.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Since they came in they#ve been fine, but recently the dominant male has had a hiss at me.#The main thing is not to run away from them, because they will chase you.#The centre has recently seen an increase in the number of birds coming through the doors, with cockerels, geese, chickens, and even peacocks, among them.Dale added: #Even at this centre alone we#ve had a lot of birds like this coming in.#Poultry are becoming a lot more common, I think that the best thing for people to do is read about these animals and make sure that you#re willing to work with them, as they can be aggressive at times.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

east end of High Street, it would be ldquoconverting part of Elcho Green to a temporary car park to support access to the High Street area.It stated that ldquofollowing a meeting with local traders, North Berwick CommunityCouncil and North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, agreement has been reached to introduce a number of temporary measures in the town ndash but both the community council and area partnership told the Courier they had not given backing to the Elcho Green changes.The councilrsquos own timetable had Elcho Green car park opening last Friday .An online petition, West Bay not Parking Bay, to ldquoprotect stunning and iconic West Bay in North Berwick, was launched by resident Sarah Russell and had attracted more than , signatures in less than a week.It said: ldquoEast Lothian Council have announced plans to turn Elcho Green into a longstay car park.ldquoWhilst the council state that this is a temporary measure to comply with their Covid Spaces for People initiative, it is greatly feared that this will, in fact, lead to a permanent car park in the most iconic seafront location in East Lothian.\"North Berwick residents and visitors alike will be robbed of the very essence of this beautul recreational space that personies this famous conservation area seafront.ldquoTemporary or otherwise, Elcho Green is not the correct location for any car parking and we would urge you to help us stop this environmental catastrophe.Among those supporting the campaign was world-famous golfer and North Berwick resident Catriona Matthew, captain of Europersquos winning Solheim Cup team.The Courier has been swamped with letters and emails against the plans .The scheme was described as ldquoindefensible and ldquoundemocratic vandalism by some residents, while many asked why there had not been specic consultation on the plan and highlighted that the land had been gted to the town by the late Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple for recreational use in .On Monday, East Lothian Council released a statement that it was placing the ldquoElcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.It is the second time in a month that the councilrsquos plans to transform town centres have hit the buffers.Earlier in July, proposals to suspend parking in town centres were put ldquoon hold after traders and residents in Haddington reacted with anger as cones and parking suspension signs were put up overnight, sparking widespread concern.In Mondayrsquos statement, Councillor Norman Hampshire , environment spokesperson, said: ldquoEast Lothian Council has successfully implemented a number of physical distancing measures on North Berwick High Street to support the need for safe access to the town centre and economic recovery.ldquoA further support for Spaces for People was a proposal to utilise a small part of Elcho Green in North Berwick as a temporary car park.ldquoThe benefit of this would have been a reduction in the number of vehicles circling and queuing for parking spaces, enhanced safety for pedestrians and cyclists within the town centre, and improved air quality.ldquoEast Lothian Council is a listening authority and we are aware of the ious perspectives being raised within the North Berwick community.ldquoAs such, we intend to place the Elcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.\"This delay will also enable us to monitor the impact of increased traffic as a result of visitors and to assess the effectiveness of measures introduced.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said that recent u-turns were down to a ldquolack of political leadership within the Labour administration.He said he received more than  emails objecting to the Elcho Green plans.He called for a report on the Spaces for People plans, and in particular parking proposals in North Berwick, to be put before a meeting of elected council group leaders in two weeksrsquo time for approval.Under emergency Covid- procedures, normal council business is currently suspended and decisions are taken at monthly meetings of the group leaders and council chief executive.He said: ldquoThe decision must be approved by councillors at the leadersrsquo group meeting and it should be open and transparent and open to the press.Mr Hampshire accused Mr Currie of ldquoplaying politics in ldquoan emergency situation.ldquoWe have allowed him to take part in the meetings with officers at every point during the discussions, said Mr Hampshire.ldquoI have got to say the Conservative Group have been fully behind what we are doing.\"For the SNP to try to play politics in a situation where their own Government is instructing local authorities to create spaces in town centres is unbelievable.Conservative councillor Craig Hoy called on the administration to ldquotake notice of the recent problems caused by parking proposals.He said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure with limited resources, but that does not remove the need for them to consult fully and communicate clearly on big issues which impact our communities.\"I hope East Lothian Council and the Labour administration will take notice of the recent problems in North Berwick and fully engage with stakeholders.\"Hilary Smith, chair of North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, stressed that the area partnership had not attended any meeting regarding Covid- plans for the town or given its approval to the plans.North Berwick Community Council said it had not discussed Elcho Green prior to its meeting on Tuesday.East Lothian Council received pound.million from Scottish Government funding for Spaces for People projects to make social distancing easier in town centres and encourage people toto them safely.The council launched a consultation in May, asking people for their county-wide views.It attracted , contributions and more than  comments, including more than  from the North Berwick area.But North Berwick residents have not been asked their specic views on Elcho Green car parking.The council said it had given consideration to parking availability at a number of sites in North Berwick.In response to questions from the Courier, the council said: ldquoThe high school and sports centre are both due to re-open in coming weeks so were unsuitable to use.ldquoAn area of Elcho Green is considered suitable to take traffic arriving from the west to park for people visiting the town to intercept the flow of traffic and stop vehicles circulating through the town unnecessarily searching for parking spaces and generating additional traffic pollution.ldquoIt also seemed reasonable considering the area of land is used annually for Fringe by the Sea events.\"A maximum of  places had been identied for use as a potential temporary car park which is not part of the Spaces for People grant but provided as part of the

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

included introducing parking suspensions across town centres as it looked to create more space outside shops and relocate parking away from high streets.In Haddington town centre there was a furious response after cones and parking suspension notices went up over the first weekend of the changes, leaving traders and their customers fuming.Shop owners who had only just opened their doors feared the restrictions would stop costumers fromcoming to the market town and within days the council announced it was putting parking suspensions in all town centres on hold.Then last week, it announced plans to transform tourist hotspot North Berwickrsquos town centre and create a temporary -space car park on its iconic Elcho Green ndash a much-loved publicspace and putting green.The response from

councilrsquos Local Review Body overturned the refusal on appeal after councillors ruled the proposal was better than leaving the building to fall into disrepair.And they questioned whether the design of the new property, which featured extensive glass frontage to let in light, would, in fact, make the amenity more acceptable.Planning officers had estimated the new one-bedroom property would offer just nine square metres of living space in the proposed kitchen living area.The review body was told that there was no set standard for amenity and outlook when it came to conversions like the one put forward for the building, on the townrsquos Lamer Street.Instead, Leigh Taylor, council planning advisor, said it was down to the inidual officer involved.He said: ldquoThere is no exact standard, it

It has to find a new purpose.Councillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairman and ward member, also upheld the appeal.He said: ldquoIt has to have another use either as commercial or residential and I think residential is a good fit for this building.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

He left behind parents Steve and Gee, sisters Donna, Stephanie, Angella and Dominique, and brother Daniel.Now,  years later, the BBC has made a one-off, -minute drama which imagines the le Walker could have lived.Written by Bafta winner Jimmy McGovern TV series such as Cracker and Broken, and the TV movie Hillsborough, Anthony is inspired by conversations with the teenagers devoted mother Gee.It is not only an incredibly moving and emotional story about loss but is also full of hope and love.The programme came about after Gee approached Liverpudlian McGovernand \"you just dont say no to Gee\", the writer lovingly quips.\"The BBC had just shown a really good film about the death of Damilola Taylor, and I knew thatI went to the BBC with a drama that showed a lead-up to the killing, the killing and the aftermath of the killing, about a young black boy, the BBC would say, Well, weve already done this with the Damilola Taylor story,\" continues McGovern, when we chat over Zoom .\"So, I had to find a fresh way in.

But when he introduced himself, \"she just basically gave all of us her blessing to tell the story and she wished us the best and it was nothing but positivity and kind words\".He chuckles as he adds what she whispered to him later on that day.\"I was improvising, I was throwing stuff in that wasnt even in the script at some points, and she just pulled me aside and went, Anthony didnt swear!\"A particularly poignant part of the film depicts Anthony getting married, to a woman named Katherine, who is played by World On Fire star Julia Brown.Gee was on set for the wedding scenes, and Jimoh recalls the moment she walked in to see him suited and booted for the ceremony.\"She grabbed me, and she went, Wow. This is what my son would look likehe was getting married.\"It was huge for both of us and we had the longest hug in the world.\"Katherine is not based on a real-le person, which Brown - known for BBC series World On Fire - describes as \"liberating\".However, there were obviously many challenging moments on set.\"Especially, with the way that Jimmy did it, the couple of the scenes at the end, we show the alternate reality,\" she elaborates.\"So, sometimes, Toheeb and I would be laughing... like, we were filming when he walks me home after our first date, and we were having a great time, and then Terry our director said to us, OK, now Toheeb, go stand over there and Julia were going to film you walking alone.\"\"And then it hits you like a wave... That was quite dficult.\"The show is coming out at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement. Following the shocking death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May - which was caught on camera - protests against racism and police brutality have taken place across the UK.\"It feeds into the conversations that people are having at the moment about the bizarre nature of racism and Anthony really highlights for me how nobody wins,\" notes Welsh star Rakie Ayola, who portrays Gee, and is best known for her role in Holby City.\"Obviously Anthonys family dont win but the people who killed him dont gain anything. They dont gain so much as a pound coin from what they do.\"There was no reason at all to kill that young man. It wasnt to take his wallet, his phone, which is ridiculous enough.

What we Scots want to know is what England is going to do about the financial mismanagement of the UK economy, because the elected representatives we send to Westminster to reflect the views of the Scottish people simply cannot influence in any meaningful way what Westminster does. The facts are glaringly obvious that, despite years of austerity, England has failed to address fundamental flaws in our common economy and has compounded problems that have had and are having a detrimental effect on all the parts of our supposed union of equals.

Dferent communities with dferent identities and dferent priorities. I do not see one homogenous nation.As a person with very deep roots in the Celtic West I feel far greater affinity with the people of Ireland than I do with many of the communities further east and south. This is not a conscious choice, rather a statement of personal orientation and belonging.The people of the Highlands and Islands have had an exceptionally poor deal from Edinburgh and its Lowland bastions in recent centuries. Infor backing the wrong horse in the , our precious Highland and Hebridean heartland has been decimated, its people and language oppressed, subjugated, burnt out and cleared.

Who knows what we can achievewe can turn dust to seed, reap our own harvest and ring our own till Ill be honest and admit that I have no idea at this stage whether or not the people of the Highlands and Islands remotely share such a vision and how this could work economically but, in an age of iconoclasm and the redefinition of identity, no Lowland politician should assume that an independent Scotland would not, in turn, find itself broken up in time by those of us wishing to assert their fundamental right to self-determination.As the creation of Holyrood emboldened nationalism, so I hope that independence will, in turn, trigger an explosion in regional identity politics within Scotland itself. One step at a time.Fraser Kelly, Millport.THERE is a simple answer to Maggie Chettys questionwhy the Prime Minster wants to hang on to Scotland. It is because that is what the people of Scotland voted for in , in a fair and free democratic referendum. You would think she might remember that.Her letter also includes a fascinating reference to the UK benefiting from ious taxes, although of course the Scottish Governments own figures tell us that Scotland gets more out of the Union by way of revenues than it puts in. The tax mentioned by Ms Chetty that is most intriguing is the one on whisky, which looks an awful lot like the mythical whisky export tax so beloved of nationalist conspiracy theorists. Likewise, she has now added a fish tax and a beef tax.Which all begs a much better question than Ms Chettys:Scottish independence is such a great idea, why do its proponents have to tell so many lies to justy it Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.THERE seems to be growing concern that interpretation of the Hate Crime Bill presently going through Holyrood would have an adverse effect on freedom of speech , particularly as regards the aspect of \"stirring up hatred\" Could those of us who write to The Herald then run the risk of being accused of that crime by the overly sensitive taking offence at our use of language criticising them, their views or their actions and as a consequence stirring up hatred in their own breastnot where  The letterfrom David Stubley provides an interesting case study in what to me appears to be its deliberate use of language chosen in sum to be inflammatory and personally derogatory viz ldquolackeys\", \"toadying\", \"fallacious\", \"lie\", \"charlatan parties and their willing acolytes\", ldquo proven liar\" and \"used car salesman\".

It is the number of wealth in Hinduism, the number of gates of heaven in Islam, and is a lucky number in China and Japan, also because of its mythological connection to prosperity.And today I am going to make my case for the power of eight for Scottish unionism, a bedraggled concept which appears in slow decline. There should be no inevitability about this, however, and indeed I would suggest that they may find their own form of prosperity should they follow these eight simple rules. - Understand where you are and why yoursquore thereIn considering the narrative of last weekrsquos visit by Boris Johnson, which was presumably pre-briefed by Downing Street, one would be forgiven for thinking that nobody in the Prime Ministerrsquos operation has seen any of the news which has emanated from Scotland over the last  years. To suddenly be plunged into apparent lsquopanic modersquo is to misunderstand unionismrsquos position. Unionismrsquos deficit has been coming for years. Indeed, far from being a resounding victory, it looks increasingly as though the  referendum simply came early enough on the x-axis for unionism to survive. But unionism is not in the doldrums because of any irresistible pull-factor inherent in Scottish nationalism rather, there is a signicant push-factor involved. Unionism is stuck in an unappealing, perpetual panic, reacting to everything, offering nothing positive. SNP wins an election unionists create the Calman Commission. Yes almost wins the referendum unionists create the Vow and the Smith Commission. It is a humiliating lack of thought, understanding and planning all rolled into one. - Be less emotionalI appreciate I am in the minority as someone who does not feel particularly nationalistic or patriotic, either towards Britain or Scotland, however unionistsrsquo emotional, sometimes rather hysterical, obsession with lsquoour precious unionrsquo is preventing sensible decision making. Too many unionists exude the air of people who are confused and embittered that the general population doesnrsquot share their unrequited love. A more clinical approach, which is much more characteristic of nationalist leaders, would create the space for far more sensible decision making.: Nicola Sturgeon facing questions over her knowledge of Alex Salmond probe - Stop visiting Scotland to lsquosave the unionrsquoThis is a foolish endeavour for a number of reasons, but most obviously it underlines the fact that members of the Cabinet seldom come to Scotland, a part of the UK which they have just as much right to visit as anywhere , including England. Cabinet visits would be far less controversial, more normal indeed,they happened more often. - Stop talking Scotland downUnionists think this is a nationalist trope, but they are wrong: the tone of unionist communications is counterproductive and corrosive. Coronavirus has turbocharged the temptation to revert to this approach, and the notion that an independent Scotland could not have afforded furlough and a range of other measures is now a centrepiece of unionist messaging. It is, of course, nonsense, and while an independent Scotland would inevitably face uncertainty in its initial years, there is no reason to expect that it would not rapidly develop the ideological maturity to create a wealthy country.:Michael Gove not distracted by independence support surge as devolution key to union case - Stop doing the nationalistsrsquo work for themA great deal of unionist action plays directly into the hands of nationalism. Because of the raw emotion , Unionists tend to define victory as denying the SNP something that it wants, without understanding that this plays perfectly into the nationalist narrative. The prime example of this, which is coming at unionists like a herd of buffalo, is the current policy of saying no to a second independence referendum, evenit is secured with a majority of seats, perhaps even votes, on a clear manesto commitment. Unionists may see this as a clever tactic which puts Nicola Sturgeon in a hole, but in the medium- to long-term it is an appalling strategy which pushes soft unionists, dismayed at the denial of democracy, to the other side. - Get Brexit doneBy default, we consider Brexit to push Scotland towards independence, but in fact a swt Brexit with a reasonable deal has a good chance of becoming a positive for unionism. I voted Remain, but despite this I expect the outcome of Brexit to be signicantly less damaging than doomsayers predict, and this, coated in the toxic prospect of a customs border between Scotland and England should an independent Scotland rejoin the EUrsquos Customs Union, may well flip the Brexit issue from the nationalist column to the unionist one. - Do moreFor a group of people who are so ostensibly passionate about keeping Scotland in the union, the UK Government is prone to leaving the field of play empty for the Scottish Government to roam free. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and his team appear to understand the pitfalls of this better than their predecessors, but much of the damage has been done. Unionists should be bolder about planting their flag on Scottish turf, including in devolved competencies, especially when theyrsquove paid for the flagpole ndash a practice which is considered normal in federal countries. - Finally, itrsquos time for a New UnionUnionists are always chasing the curve reacting, panicking, misstepping. They need to make a calm, clinical analysis of where the people of the nations of the UK want to be in  years, and create a positive, proactive vision of a New Unionism which takes us all there. It is, in my view, highly likely to involve both more muscular unionismas well as an enhancement of devolved powers. They can call this federalism, or any other of the myriad terms people use for it ndash it is what it is. But whatever they call it, unionists should understand that New Unionism has a real chance of appealing to many of the soft centrists whom they have pushed towards nationalism.

Government efforts to calm the unrest have so far failed.The protests are a reminder that things are not so rosy for President Vladimir Putin.Despite this monthrsquos orchestrated vote on constitutional amendments that would allow him to rule for a further two terms, the regimersquos identity has deteriorated and is more fragile than ever.Indeed, an increasingly active civil society, an anxious but powerful elite, and a stagnating economy battered by Covid- means that should Mr Putin want to rule until , they will be the hardest years of his presidency.First there are the voters. For all the thuggery and kleptocracy of Mr Putinrsquos rule, his legitimacy remains tied to the idea of public support.His popularity is a mix of genuine loyalty and apathy, with roots in the early s oil boom which lted millions out of poverty.It was the beginning of a social contract that provided economic growth and stability, but indemanded the population turn a blind eye to the de-politicisation of public le.Voting became an act of theatre, the Kremlin deploying lsquogovernment resourcesrsquo ndash propaganda, coercion, manipulation ndash to make sure Mr Putinrsquos validity could not be questioned.As growth stalled a new conservative narrative emerged which continues to dominated politics today.In it, the Kremlin portrays Mr Putin as the only capable defender of a Russia besieged by internal and external enemies.The success of this narrative is waning. Most Russians care about schools, roads and hospitals. Others about the environment, internet freedoms and pensions.They want someone to tackle poor infrastructure, rising utility bills and unchecked corruption.These issues have spawned protests across the country. Some have remained local and apolitical. Others have become about power and accountability.Either way the increase in protests point to risingnot disparate civic activism amongst parts of the population the Kremlin needs to keep onside. The more these grievances are seen as consequences of Mr Putinrsquos rule, the harder it becomes for the president to avoid responsibility.Next is the elite. It is not just legitimacy derived from the public that Mr Putin relies on ndash he also needs the support of those in power around him.The presidentrsquos system is dominated by a handful of political, financial and industry figures who have accumulated interests and assets they want to protect.When this collides with structures that prevent traditional transfers of power, you get a succession problem. Indeed, the last few years has seen infighting bubble to the surface as elites jostle to best position themselves for a potential post-Putin world.Power struggles have played out in boardrooms and across the court system.How do you pass on a personalised system with no checks and balances  Who do you trust For now Mr Putinrsquos response to these questions has been to bury speculation by allowing himself to rule for another two terms. This is unlikely to assuage the worries of the elite in the long term.There remains no clear plan for Russiarsquos future.Then there is the economy. Despite often being described as close to collapse, it has shown itself to be resilient thanks to a well managed central bank and focus on macroeconomic stability.Years of sanction-induced isolation has helped Moscow prepare for financial shocks. But the economy remains vulnerable and has long suffered from stagnation ndasha result of the political decision to prioritise control over growth.Covid- has exacerbated these concerns, plunging the economy into deep recession. While the government has rolled out a stimulus package the response has been slow, and the worry is it wonrsquot be enough.Russiarsquos business ombudsman reported in May that  per cent of companies may struggle to survive. The economy could contract by as much as six percent this year.To make matters worse, the pandemic has come on the back of a price crash and drop in demand for oil, Russiarsquos main export earner.It may take years for consumption to rebound.Any recovery will be complicated by market shts towards decarbonisation and cheaper renewables.The Kremlin will likely find itself relying more on China but increased dependency will bring risks.To properly future-proof its economy Moscow will need to not only welcome innovation and ersication but also a fundamental restructure of a system long resistant to change."},{"url":null,"title":"stunning-570k-airdrie-mansion-sauna-grabs-2-50-raffle-competition","story":"The concept is simple ndash anyone over the age of  can enter the competition by answering one question, paying the pound. entry fee, and a winner is drawn using a number generating algorithm.The cap for ticket entrants is set at , tickets before the planned draw.Thiswas meantto take place in March, but has been postponed to December as a result of the coronavirus.Philip Leckie, who lived in the five-bedroom detached house at  AlexanderStreet, Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, for nearly a decade, has received interest from across the globe with his alternative and ldquomore creative way to pass on the property to a new owner.He said:ldquoWe got surveyors in who said it was worth around pound, ndash but wersquod be lucky to get pound, for it, maybe less.ldquoI thought to myself, lsquothere must be another way of doing thisrsquo.It was at that point that Philip came up with the idea of holding a competition ndash and is even planning to donate a large portion of the money raised to Airdriersquos local St Andrewrsquos Hospice.The home includes a sauna,large lounge, conservatory, sun lounge and full attic space.There is also a detached garage with a driveway fit for multiple cars.He continued: ldquoMy grandshyfather died in St Andrewrsquos Hospice about  years ago, and the hospice staff were always more than helpful ndash not just for my grandfather but for the entire family.ldquoThey are just amazing, even seeing the way they cared for Fernando Ricksen in his final months was incredible and inspiring.

Irsquod just learnt that ldquothe most blatant example of dark money in recent electoral politics can be traced to the south Glasgow suburb of Clarkston.The poundk-plus that the Democratic Unionist Partyspent on pro-Brexit advertising in the run up to the June  referendum on the UKrsquos membership of the European Union ndash not in Northern Ireland but Great Britain ndash was donated by an obscure body named the Constitutional Research Council . Its only named director was Richard Cook, a multiply-failed Tory candidate of Clarkston parish.This incident is totemic of the tawdry tale of secretive donors and anonymous propaganda that Geoghegan, investigations editor at independent media  openDemocracy and founder of the award-winning investigative website The Ferret, painstakingly weaves in Democracy for Sale. There are a few diamond mines and Russian ambassadors, itrsquos true, but in the main this story unfolds in unstimulating locales and features compromised mediocrities such as Cook.His business interests are nearly as convoluted as those of Arron Banks, one of the self-proclaimed ldquoBad Boys of Brexit. Drawing on the resources of a miasma of offshore companies, Banks bankrolled the belligerent, anti-immigration Leave.EU campaign with the ldquobiggest donation in British political history.The National Crime Agency investigated Banksrsquo pound.m donation to anti-EU causes amid mounting speculation about the source of the funds, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. Banks hailed the ruling as vindication of his Brexit campaign, but others saw it as ldquotacit acceptance that companies in offshore jurisdictions could underwrite political donations.The campaign for Brexit mingled such offshore money with obscure onshore funding. The CRCrsquos donation to the DUP encapsulates the problem. The CRC is an unincorporated association, not subject to the normal disclosure requirements that an incorporated company must meet. According to Geoghegan, unincorporated associations are ldquoblack boxes that can be set up for the sole purpose of funnelling money to political campaigns, with little or no transparency.The influential European Research Groupis also an unincorporated association. Geoghegan shows how the ERG, a party within a party that ldquobrought down a Conservative prime minister and called the tune on Brexit, was able to trouser around pound, in taxpayer money between  and  ldquothanks to a little-used Westminster convention. Another scream moment.The tale of how dark money reshaped the political agenda in the UK and beyond pullulates with such dim-lit legal entities. The same people and companies ndash Cambridge Analytica, Dominic Cummings, Nigel Farage ndash keep reappearing from the mists of an opaque complex of vested interests.Geoghegan claries that he does not believe Brexit was ldquosome grand conspiracy. The British state and the political and business establishment were behind Remain. Instead, he says, the referendum and its aftermath reveal something more fundamental and systemic: ldquoa broken political system that is ripe for exploitation.Arguably, the groundwork for Brexit ndash and for Donald Trump and Boris Johnsonrsquos victories at the ballot box ndash was laid by another brand of unaccountable entity: the think tank. In theory, think tanks do research and publish research papers in practice, says Geoghegan, ldquoWords like lsquoinstitutersquo and lsquocentrersquo give an appearance of academic rigour to what is essentially paid-for lobbying.In the book, Geoghegan illuminates a network of libertarian think tanks that have sought to shunt the political agenda to the right in the UK and the US. Of course, there are left-leaning think tanks too, but, as Geoghegan notes, they are generally more transparent about their funding, as they rely on public money and donations from trusts.Anonymous funding makes think tanks the ideal vehicle for business interests to influence government policy beneath the radar. Geoghegan shows how a ldquotiny group of American plutocrats invested billions in think tanks, universities and election campaigns over the last four decades. ldquoBefore this methodical and precisely targeted spending spree, libertarians had been largely thought of as cranks, he writes. ldquoAfterwards, the limited space within which policies are created and publicly discussed was filled with proposals that they wanted.The ldquogrande dame of libertarian think tanks is the Institute for Economic Affairsin London. Geoghegan reveals how the IEArsquos ldquosunny analysis about Brexit and unprecedented access to ministers helped determine the UK governmentrsquos course after the referendum. The IEA also worked to promote the idea of the Anglosphere in the UK ndash a union of English-speaking people as a bulwark against Brussels bureaucrats first mooted by Margaret Thatcher in .Democracy for Sale appears just as the UK government publishes its long-awaited report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics. Geoghegan touches on Russian influence in the UK and beyond, but the bulk of the dark money and misinformation that he documents sits much closer to home.ldquoHiding in plain sight is a phrase that recurs throughout this book. The ultimate source of the money donated to the DUP by the CRC in the run-up to the EU referendum was protected not by cloak-and-dagger Brexiteers but by Northern Irish legislation. Subsequent Electoral Commission inquiries into the donation proved toothless. ldquoThe system is broken, and nobody intends to fix it, transparency activist Tamasin Cave tells Geoghegan.In ldquothe digital Wild West, accountability is in even shorter supply. Geoghegan conjures a blizzard of examples of the disturbing ways in which digital campaigning can be used to undermine democratic mechanisms, from targeted messaging to voter suppression.In this shadowy world, truth is the first casualty. During the  general election campaign, the Conservative Party rebranded its Twitter account as FactcheckUK with no consequences. However, all the blame for the increasing role of unregulated digital campaigning in our politics cannot be laid at the door of right-wing parties. Barack Obama was one of the first to harness its power.Written in crisp, vivid prose, Democracy for Sale is a dense but compelling narrative that takes us from the backstreets of Washington DC to Viktor Orbagravenrsquos Hungary. Above all, it is a call to arms, and everyone who is concerned about our democracy should read it.While Geoghegan remains an optimist, he does not hide the scale or urgency of the challenge. ldquoLike the climate, democracy is fast reaching a tipping point, he warns."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-kirsty-hughes-time-scottish-politics-move-constitutional-divide","story":"Butitrsquos a question of when, not , another vote will happen, wouldnrsquot it be good to get it over with quickly  Scotlandrsquos politics may look relatively normal compared to the extraordinary trajectory of the UKrsquos politics in recent years. But itrsquos not that normal, or that healthy, when the dominant issue in politics is essentially a permanent campaign to which most  is subsumed .Of course, with ldquoyes ahead in the polls, and Johnson in office, itrsquos the pro-independence side that would grab the chance of an early voteit could. But the unionist side might consider where things will be in early . The economic impacts of the Covid crisis will still be strongly felt then , and ndash it has to be hoped ndash the health impacts will be much more under control.Some independence supporters might prefer a slower path ndash building support to % and more, working up the policy arguments. And many unionists doubtless hope that putting it off for several years will, somehow, lead to a sea-change in opinion.But, in the end, a politics of constant campaigning has some real downsides, whichever side yoursquore on. For a start, it means a mostly very inward-looking and a very process-driven debate. Is the Union a great thing or on its last legs  Does the Scottish Government have a democratic mandate to hold another vote  How badly is devolution maling  Would any Plan B work  And so on.True, the SNP policy of independence in the EU means some attention is paid to European issues ndash mainly to the key independence questions of whether, under what conditions and how quickly an independent Scotland could join the EU. But how many times does the same ground need to be gone over . Circular debate on the same issues is the inevitable outcome of a permanent but unresolved constitutional ide.Meanwhile, bigger issues of the European green deal, the massive new Covid recovery fund and future EU budget deal, the EUrsquos failures on the refugees and migration front, its populist and rule of law challenges, are all rather far from most Scottish political and policy debate. Beyond the EU, the current state of global power politics was parlous and deeply troubling even before the Covid- crisis. Whether as part of the UK, or as an independent Scotland in the EU, these global challenges need serious debate.And,Scotland does choose independence, then the process of becoming a well-established, mature independent state will take time. Itrsquos not only a question of the transitions from the UK and into the EU but a question of active, long-term state-building.And , contrary to current polls, Scotland chose to stay in the UK, then political time could be used to push for a more positive transformation of the Union rather than the catalogue of destructive errors currently emanating out of London. Resolving the constitutional debate quickly would free up time for such vital issues.But, of course, democratic politics doesnrsquot work that way. Democracy takes time. The UK and Scottish governments will continue their stand-off over another referendum SNP infighting over tactics will doubtless continue and opposition parties will carry on inveighing against independence. And, while the constitutional issue is at the core of Scottish politics, then it will be a politics dominated by a rather inward-looking debate.But the world is in a deeply unstable state and it would behove both sides of the independence ide to spend more time engaging with those wider challenges.Scotlandrsquos politics, given the constitutional ide, is inevitably stuck in a repetitive campaigning state.

It will take place on October .Nomination forms are now available and these can be lodged with the council from August  and by August .Interim chief executive with the council John Mundell said: “If you have considered standing for election in the past, or feel that you could contribute now to local government in Orkney, this is a great opportunity to serve the community and gain some experience as a councillor until the next local government elections take place again in May .“I would encourage everyone who feels they may be able to contribute to the local democratic process to consider standing as a candidate in this by-election.”The North Isles ward is served by three councillors. Along with councillor Woodbridge, councillor Graham Sinclair and councillor Stephen Clackson were elected at the last council election.Councillor Sinclair said: “Being a north isles councillor is a challenging yet rewarding and very ied post to hold. I find it very satisfying when you can help a ward member with their problems, making the necessary connections to the services they require, or raising an issue that an isles community is facing.“I live on the mainland and I don’t feel this has been a disadvantage to me, as I have lived in the isles for many years previously. But I do feel that candidates should have some idea of what le in the isles is like.“For me, the only essential requirement is a genuine interest in the communities in the isles and a desire to help move them forward.“With eight dferent community councils within the ward, all on dferent islands, I can honestly say that the travel between these communities is an enjoyable part of the job # in the Summer months especially!”Nomination forms for prospective candidates are available by calling the Council’s Election Office on   or sending an email to electionoffice@orkney.gov.uk They will also be available online later this weekcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Inner Wheel has Clubs right across the island of Ireland including in Ballymena. The local Club recently celebrated its th anniversary, Patricia has been involved in her local Club for around  years and, most recently, was Club President. Patricia said: “It is an immense honour to have the opportunity to lead our organisation. Although somewhat daunted by the responsibility which comes with the role of Chair I am nonetheless excited by the prospect for the year ahead. “The ongoing global pandemic undoubtedly brings enormous challenges for our organisation but by embracing the opportunities which technology offers there are ways in which we can keep the spirit of Inner Wheel alive. “I am immensely encouraged by the way in which our members have already adapted to the new normality. The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months.

I found them very professional and confidential and the end result was that I met my partner Paula, he said. Having found his own perfect match, Paul is keen to help other men in the same position and is applying  years worth of skills in business ownership, management, customer care and relationship building to help in their search for the one.He#ll also be helping men become Mr Right, and his advice will be more vital than ever for clients anxious about the daunting prospect of going back to face-to-face dates post-lockdown.Given my own positive experience I felt that I could offer a lot to the company in terms of seeing things from a man#s perspective. I#ve been single, married, separated and met the new love of my le, so I#ve experienced it all, Paul said. If a person of my age can meet someone new, it shows that le is certainly not over and that there#s hopefully a match for everyone. I#ll take them under my wing, talk them through the process, answer any questions and calm their fear, which is always the biggest thing holding people back.

The one to Mr McAdam ly quotes him as telling a newspaper: At first I was opposed to the initiative. However, when I saw the preparation, the community backing, and some  volunteers, I thought I needed to revisit the idea.The letter to Mr Goggin takes the form of a press release to all media outlets in Belfast. It ly quotes him as expressing delight at supporting Open Ormeau. It then goes on to quote two real-le disabled customers of his - a female wheelchair user and a partially sighted male - backing the initiative.Mr Goggin said: It#s a sinister letter which I regard as an attempt to intimidate myself and my  staff and to undermine and discredit my position.All I am doing is trying to save the business I have worked hard to build up over  years.Whoever sent this letter may see me as a #wee greengrocer# whom they can silence. They are wrong.Mr McAdam said: When I spoke out against Open Ormeau, I never expected anything like this. I believe this letter is designed to intimidate me from airing my views. Those behind it won#t succeed, but I#ve a young family and the whole experience has left me very worried and stressed about the impact on them.The hand-writing on both envelopes was dferent, and the letters inside were typed. From examining the correspondence, the businessmen believe that at least three people were involved.DUP MLA Christopher Stalford said: These are sinister letters. Michael and Fergal should not have to put up with action like this because they dared to express their concerns about potential dangers to their businesses. This is supposed to be a community conversation but it seems there are some people who aren#t prepared to simply agree to disagree with others.SDLP councillor Gary McKeown said: I absolutely condemn any attempt by anyone to shut down the conversation and make people feel unable to share their views about the project.Anyone for or against must be able to comment freely. It is only through dialogue that we can reach common ground.Open Ormeau initially hoped to close the road to traffic during every summer weekend. It has been strongly backed by local pubs and restaurants. But in light of opposition from many other businesses - worried about a fall in trade - the plans have been reduced to only some weekend days in August.The new proposals will be discussed by Belfast City Council#s strategic policy and resources committee on Friday. The DUP opposes the plan. If Sinn Fein also fails to back it, the initiative will fail.Mr Goggin said he was so worried that the proposals would close his business that he has written to First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill. The Belfasthas contacted Open Ormeau for comment. Supporters of the initiative insist it has strong community support and was endorsed by two-thirds of almost , people who took part in an online survey.

Mr Wells, who has had the DUP party whip removed, made the comments during a debate in the Assembly. The GAA rejected his criticism.Defending the remarks on BBC Radio Ulster#s Nolan Show on Tuesday morning, Mr Wells referred to comments made by DUP MLA Edwin Poots while he was the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure in , claiming that the GAA was a cold house for the unionist community.Here we are  years later and there still has been no progress made on making the GAA more inclusive to the whole community, Mr Wells told the Nolan Show. It is .% nationalist.He added: If soccer or rugby was entirely Protestant or Catholic there would be huge questions asked about why vast amounts of public money is being poured into an organisation that has failed to attract people from the other side of the fence as it where. Similar the GAA has done nothing in my opinion to make itself more inclusive and friendly to the Protestant community.They haven#t moved on at all.Mr Wells made the remarks during a debate bout the Executive CommitteeBill on Monday. Critics of the bill say it will reduce areas in which ministers# power is constrained by the Executive as a whole.Mr Wells used the planning decision on Casement Park as an example of how a minister could go on a solo run.Mr Wells told MLAs: Say Sinn Fein decided to spend a vast amount of money, as it could, holding the Department for Communities, on making Casement Park even grander. Read More DUP MLA Jim Wells urged to retract remarks as he brands GAA #sectarian and republican# during debateThat would cause huge concern amongst the unionist community given the sectarian and republican nature of the GAA.Brian McAvoy, chief executive of Ulster GAA, speaking on Radio Ulster#s Good Morning Ulster, said that it was not a surprise that Mr Wells was not the biggest fan of the GAA. He said GAA volunteers had been at the forefront of the community response to the Covid- pandemic. They have been delivering food parcels and delivering pharmaceuticals to our most vulnerable in our communities, he said.I am quite certain we were not asking people their religion or political persuasion before we were knocking on their doors. On this coming Friday, in Croke Park, we have the Muslim festival of Eid taking place. Because of restricted numbers and restricted venues, they have chosen Croke Park to hold this, so I think that shows that we are certainly not sectarian. Sinn Fein#s South Down MLA Sinead Ennis called on Mr Wells to retract his comments as the GAA could not be further from that. Following the debate, SDLP MLA Justin McNulty, a former All-Ireland winner, said there were hundreds of people in GAA clubs across Ireland who have done more to reconcile communities and bring people together than Mr Wells.It is incredibly disappointing that he continues to use isive, offensive language to label our community of volunteers who are working hard, including throughout the pandemic, to support people, he added.Read More DUP#s Gregory Campbell accused of mocking Irish language after #crass and despicable# social media postMeanwhile, the DUP have been challenged to act on comments by DUP MP Gregory Campbell mocking the Irish language.The East Londonderry MP made the remarks on his Facebook page on Sunday in relation to a BBC programme about a suspected Nazi spy who lived in Donegal during the Second World War.He said: I#m informed that BBC  NI had a programme on tonight about a suspected German spy who lived in the RoI during the war. The humourous bit was that he was supposed to have spoken Irish with a German accent.I vill not be tempted to ask vot is dis curried yoghurt mein herr.Sinn Fein labelled the remarks crass and offensive and the SDLP called on Mr Campbell to apologise for his comments.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry Central Library in Foyle Street is one of just five libraries from across the North which were chosen to be part of a pilot scheme to allow customers back in. Branch Library Manager, Koran Burns, said people were delighted toto the facility, which shut on March .

Customers are being asked to keep a social distance and limit their time on the computers or browsing for books to half an hour. There are also self service machines for borrowing books.

He will not be able to call on Shane Lagan after the long-serving defenders retirement. Also gone is Conor McGurk who is still in Australia following the coronavirus pandemic. One man who is back in the fold is Paddy Henry, who has played just one game since the clubs  intermediate championship win. Lavey won the minor football and hurling double last season, but due to the young age profile of the team only minor football skipper Cormac Collins and Ryan McGill have graduated to the senior ranks. googletag.cmd.push He acknowledges the work going on around the club, referencing the U success and a useful U group. “From my point of view, I wish they would come through a bit quicker,” McGarvey jokes. While this weekends opponents have been busy with challenge games, Lavey had just Sundays draw with Carrickmore to help their championship preparation. “Thats all we are going to take,” the Lavey boss stressed, rolling out the names of the dual players in his plans. Fintan Bradley, Dara McPeake, Aidan Toner, the McGill brothers , Liam and Colm Murphy. “I envisage  of our team will be dual players. They wont all start on the football team, but they are aiming to play both,” predicts McGarvey, who leads the management team of Simon Wilson, Ben Dodds, Adie McGill and Mark Hearty. googletag.cmd.push “You are not going to know until you start playing. The boys were glad to get out, but we have a tough schedule because nearly all our players are dual players. We were going four or five times a week and we had to cut it back on them.” On the other side of the coin, Dee Doherty is back in charge of Na Magha, eight years after helping them to an Ulster final where they went down to Bredagh. Galway native Tomaacutes Lally, who has transferred from London club St Gabriels, joins him on the management team. “We are trying to build, like other clubs and counties are doing, to try and progress,” said Doherty, who knows the hurling scene well in his role as physio with Derry senior hurlers. “We want to rise up from being Na Magha, the junior team in Derry. It is a game we are looking forward to, with the incentive of it being your first game at home. We know it is Lavey and we know what we are up against.” It will be a chastening experience for his young side, with many of them going straight in against senior clubs in their first year of adult hurling. Many of his squad work in the retail sector, so balancing shts around training has proved dficult. In a  or  day spell Doherty has juggled challenge games with Donegal sides Burt, St Eunans, Setanta and Buncrana. “We have not been able to get the same team out for any of the games,” said Doherty, who was happy to be working with a group of  plus players. “Of that, nine are first year minors and cant play, but we are thinking down the line to next year and the year after. I have never saw numbers like that at Na Magha in my le,” he said. Having their own base is important, but Doherty points to the efforts of Ciaran McCarron and the coaches who have nurtured the upcoming minor squad. “There is a good group of players there that are interested in playing. You are trying to mix them with the older boys. We want to progress into the intermediate level, thats the aim. “For us to win anything this year, we are going to have to beat one of the senior clubs in the county. If we could win one championship game this year, it would be a result for us and that is the target we set out for ourselves.” It will be a long-term project and continuity will be the key. Home advantage will give Na Magha a familiar surrounding, but Lavey should head back down the Glenshane pass with the points. VERDICT: Lavey RELATED- Sean Leos masterclass not enough to clinch Coleraine win.

Ballyhales fabric was well-tested on an afternoon of drama at Paacuteirc Esler. After the game, a relieved Henry Shefflin told reporters his side was put to the pin of their collar, while Michael McShane believed there was still an All-Ireland in the Slaughtneil side. It wont be this season. The GAA omitted the provincial and All-Ireland club competitions from theirto play roadmap. Michael McShane didnt comment on the decision that would prevents his side from defending their title, should they emerge from Derry. googletag.cmd.push “You are only in the position to question thatyou are county champions,” he stated of the GAAs decision. “Like every other year, we just focus on winning Derry, thats the first hurdle. To seewe are good enough to do that and complete eight-in-a-row. If nothing  happens, we will have retained our county title and it will be a good year.” The seeding from last years league placings keeps them apart from a Kevin Lynchs side that have been snapping on their heels in recent seasons. The first challenge is Ballinascreen, who pushed the Lynchs every step of the way in last years championship. It took a late Niall Ferris goal to seal the deal, but it wasnt before a Reece McSorley goal and a point from Aaron Kelly had Screen well in the hunt. googletag.cmd.push Cathal McDaid s as manager, with Danny McGrellis, Hugh Pat Kelly, Michael James Groogan and Dave McGurk in the management team. Their new intake of minors includes Niall Doyle, Ronan McKenna, James O’Connor, Emmett Donnelly and Jamie Murray, but theywill be without the injured Ciaran McBride. The Emmets welcome back Paul McNeill after a -month lay-off with a shoulder injury. Liam Cassidys knee injury has recovered and Prionsias Burke has ed from a year studying in Liverpool. “You wouldve thought he had never been away,” said McShane of McNeills , which will also be welcome news for football boss Paul Bradley. “Hewas just so pleased and happy to get back at it. We are in a good position this year, with Paul, Liam and Prionsias all adding to the strength of the . “You were looking at a summer with nothing, but its great to get back as a group in each others company.” In previous seasons, the Slaughtneil football and hurling training schedule was dependent on the next game and what code needed the immediate focus. This year, both teams are going to continue training when possible during the groups, according McShane, before prioritising ahead of the knock-out stages. “Pauland myself are talking very regularly to keep on top of it, so that we are not overworking the lads.” highlighted McShane, who has retained the same management team that includes Alex Campbell, Noel Brick, Bernard Cassidy, Barney and Patrick McEldowney. “It has all been very good so far. The players are happy and the football management is happy,” he added. The players were upbeat about theirto action after the lay-off,while stressing the importance of players taking responsibility for their own health and checking their temperature regularly in the midst of the training programme. “As the saying goes, you never miss the water til the well runs dry. I hope and pray to God we can get on with it, there will be no issues and we can enjoy a summer of hurling and football like we normally do.” In the world of a condensed season and a raft of dual players, an early win will dilute the importance ofgroupgames further down the track. Its hard to look past an early Slaughtneil victory. VERDICT: Slaughtneil RELATED- Early goals make the dference for Kevin Lynchs.

The Erins Own side went into an early lead with points from Ryan McGill, Fintan Bradley and Liam Murphy. Deaglan Foley kept the city men in touch and when they got back into the game. It was point for point and the sides were level at the break, - each. Ciaran Hendry, Paddy Henry and Ryan McGill pushed Lavey three points clear and on their way to victory. It was a good workout, Lavey manager Johnny McGarvey said after the game. googletag.cmd.push It was awkward and it was a tough breeze to play in. Theywere fairly physical and we were happy enough to get a win. The Lavey boss referenced his sides lack of composure in front of goal, allowing Na Magha to stay in the game. I would safely say we had  wides and we gave away a lot of frees and eight of their  scores came from frees, McGarvey added. That makes it dficult, giving away frees for hands on back and wee flicks on men...things that you shouldnt be doing and then we were missing our own frees. That was letting them back into the game. googletag.cmd.push Apart from Ryan McGill having space when he hit the games first point, neither side created an out and out goal chance. I thought Na Magha were very good and they defended very well, the Lavey boss concluded. It is about getting two points and there will be teams sitting on zero points this week. The first game is about winning, we will know all about it with Slaughtneil next. Report and photos in Mondays Derry News and Tuesdays County Derry Post. RELATED- Slaughtneil ease past Screen.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation. Take a trip with confidence Northern Ireland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. googletag.cmd.push The national tourist organisations of Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation. Summer is here and the United Kingdom is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much-needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. googletag.cmd.push Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation. But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines. Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. “They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry. “All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. “But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.” Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps. When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem. Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.  LUXURY STAY: Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey at the Merchant Hotel Relax in five-star luxury Social distancing measures aren’t the only change visitors are experiencing at Belfast’s five-star Merchant Hotel. The hotel has used lockdown time to complete its pound, investment of the Great Room Restaurant and Cocktail Bar. The management team is confident that customers will benefit from, but not be inconvenienced by, the Covid- compliant changes it has also made. The Great Room has been reimagined to create a standalone restaurant and the Cocktail Bar has also benefited from signicant refurbishment. Other venues within the Beannchor Group portfolio have also opened their doors. Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey said: “We’re aware that customers and guests may be curious about the experience that awaits them and, while there are measures in place that follow the scientic guidelines and industry best practice to ensure the safety of our staff and customers at all times, we have striven to minimise the impact to the overall experience at all our venues.” Camping perfect for keeping distance Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond. Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular. middot Wales is open for camping from  July.  Courtesy of Cool Camping Extra measures in place so you can embark on a lakeside holiday Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures. They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Local playwright Brian Foster recently decided to write a poem about the city, following the positive response when he penned a poem about Creggan where he grew up. .However, he wanted to give people an opportunity to help him write the Derry poem. He started the ball rolling by putting the first line of the poem on to the Memories of Creggan Facebook. He then asked people to come up with ideas for the next line of the poem. Through this process, the poem, entitled My Derry Days, was created. googletag.cmd.push Mr Foster said he was delighted with the response to his initiative. “As far as I’m aware, this is the first time a poem has been written in this online manner by any community anywhere in Ireland. Perhaps even further afield,” he said. “The standard of the entries was so high that the hardest bit was selecting the winning line each night from so many brilliant efforts.” Read more about this story and the finished poem in todays Derry News. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We havent even had that conversation with the players because the sole focus is on Monday.“It will be a really tough game against a good side in Glentoran.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along. Recently, it seems to be turning out to more of a community effort to be honest, he said.ldquoAt the beginning of lockdown I missed all my friends, but the farm helped keep me busy.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be a great lover of completing schoolwork at home. I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

If there had have been, the guide would have stopped and taken him down.Jules was later told by the Matterhorn Museum that itrsquos believed he was the youngest person ever to have mastered the peak.Chris, now living with his family in the Scottish Highlands where he and his we Mignonne run a gin distillery, Daffyrsquos, said: ldquoJules has always loved climbing since he was able to walk. Whether it was trees or rocks, he progressed doing indoor climbing walls and roped up climbing outdoors.A former professional snowboarder, Chris grew up on Sketrick Island, near Killinchy, with his parents, Zora and Paul.He developed a love of mountains and climbing as a child in the Mournes and through his schoolrsquos mountaineering club, so it was inevitable he would pass on his passion for the outdoors to Jules and his elder brother,  year-old Louis.ldquoWersquove always climbed as a family but several years ago Jules was asked to do a school project on any subject and he chose to do one on climbing the Matterhorn, explained Chris.ldquoOne day he asked mehe could climb the Matterhorn some time and I said of course, rather thinking it was a joke.ldquoBut Jules really put in the training himself and kept pushing me to take on a hike or a climb. He was always very capable as we have always climbed as a family.Chris said that Jules continued to put the work into building up his skills and stamina for the climb mdash even the Covid- could not defeat the  year-oldrsquos determination to climb the mountain.ldquoWe had lined up an American friend of ours to guide us, but he couldnrsquot travel due to the pandemic so we thought we would go with the local mountain guides.ldquoHowever, they told Jules that he couldnrsquot do it until he was  and after he proved himself. We did a lot of high altitude extreme rock climbs. They watched Jules, saw that he was very capable and decided to give him a shot.While Chris was prepared to try and make his sonrsquos ambition to come true, even he was surprised when they safely made the summit and ed back down without incident.ldquoI donrsquot think I fully expected we would make it to the top, admitted Chris. ldquoJules gave me a hug at the very top and said he couldnrsquot believe he had done it. He thought it was incredible but it did take a while for it to sink in afterwards.While Jules may be eligible for an entry into the Guinness Book of Records, his dad said that accolade is not what Jules was about.ldquoHersquos not a glory hunter in any sense, hersquos just appreciative and proud to have done it.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.

Pic: Steven McAuley McAuley Multimedia“The local community has once again been plunged into sadness – that people have lost their lives at this notorious crossroads.”Two off-duty soldiers on a fishing trip lost their lives in a collision between a car and a tractor at the same crossroads in August .At an inquest the following year, the site was described as having “a collision history” – with motorists sometimes failing to realise they were approaching a junction.PSNI Inspector David Anderson said: “I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this collision, or who may have captured dash cam footage, to contact us on  quoting reference number    .”DUP MLA Mervyn Storey said the community “is reeling with shock and sadness” at reports of the latest tragedy.The North Antrim representative said: “We can’t begin to imagine the shock and hurt for the loved ones of those who have sadly lost their lives.“Any death at any time is heartbreaking but in these sudden and tragic circumstances the grief and pain experienced will be even more profound.”Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan said the local community has been left shocked following the deaths. “People have been shocked, saddened and devastated by the deaths of three people in a road collision near Portglenone,” he said. “This is a terrible blow to all those involved in this incident.“Any death on our roads is one too many and incidents like this are a reminder of the vital importance of road safety,” Mr McGuigan added. The coroner at the time of the  inquest into the deaths of the two soldiers, John Leckey, said: “I always hope something will arise out of a tragedy that will improve matters and may prevent the occurrence of something similar.”At the same inquest, a road traffic collision investigator from Forensic Science Northern Ireland described the junction with Ballyconnelly Road as being clearly marked with signs and road markings however, it was also determined that the soldiers’ car failed to stop at the junction resulting in a collision with a tractor.Lance Corporal David Gwilt from Bedford, and Rleman Dale Harris from Barnsley were declared dead at the scene.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...Introducing the motion, Councillor Sean Clarke said: “I believe the Davagh Dark Sky park contains a number of elements of signicancewhich meet the criteria for designation of a world heritage site.”His party colleague, Councillor Cora Corry described Davagh “as the middle of nowhere and the centre of the universe” and said she would be supportingthe motion.Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Cathal Mallaghan said the work in Davagh over the last number of years has been “pretty spectacular”.“I think this is the next natural step for Davagh to take. Stonehedge is younger than Davagh and you see the signicanceof places like it, so thank-you for the motion Cllr Clarke,” he said.DUP group leader Councillor Paul McLean thanked Councillor Clarke for amending the motion before bringing it to the floor.“My concern is that this is a very costly process and I would just like to see the whole outworkingof the process,” he said.“I believe there will be a lot of officer input. From what I understand it will be a lot of work, it will be good to get our heads around that and seethere is any funding available that can assist us in that process.”UUP Councillor Robert Colvin commended Councillor Clarke for the eloquencewith which he delivered the motion.“I do welcome the word explore becausethe way it was written initially I was concerned Council would have had no more input, this clarication is much appreciated,” said Councillor Colvin.“This exploration has to take into account the livelihood of people in that area and their ability to develop somewhere close to it, we have to think of the here and now.“Having made those comments, as long as that is taken into account, we would support the motion.”SDLP Councillor Kerri Hughes confirmed her party would be supporting the motion and said such recognitionwould really put Davagh and Mid Ulster as a whole “on the map”.Councillor Mark Glasgow said the key to this was going to be “getting the balance right” between protecting the site and allowing the local economy to grow.“From a planning point of view, something could be brought before committee,” said the UUP Councillor. “To ensure we get the right balance that it doesn’t restrict our development plan or business and the further encouragement of tourism in that area.”His party colleague Councillor Walter Cuddy said his initialreaction was that Councillor Clarke was reaching for the stars with this proposal and said he hoped there was no ulterior motive.“We are a bit concerned of the time and effort that could be involved in this and hope it is not for other planning applications nearby thatwe get this into the pipeline it might effect something nearby,” said Cllr Cuddy.“If we can pull it off great but I have serious doubts. The park is not even open yet. I would have thought this would have been good in a year or two’s time when we have something sell and get out there.“That’s why we feel it is maybe a bit too early.”Ulster Unionist Councillor Derek McKinney also expressed concern in relation to planning.“We have just come out of lockdown andthis was to go forward that would put the surrounding area back into lockdown as far as planning was concerned,” said Cllr McKinney.“There is a wider picture to look at here and we need to look at it and see what the consequences may be before we move forward.”Sinn Fein councillor Sean McPeake said that listening to the last few comments he felt people were a bit unnerved by the proposal.“This proposal does not do away with lighting, development can still occur and I think some of the nervousness is .“I place my trust in Councillor Clarke given his passion for the area.”In conclusion Councillor Clarke thanked the chamber for the opportunity to bring the motion forward.“I thought about this for a long time. The dark sky park area is a limited area,” he said.“I thought it was better to keep it compact so that it does not impact on the surrounding community.”The motion received unanimous support in the chamber.Thanking the chamber and describing the motion as a step forward for Mid Ulster, Councillor Clarke invited everyone in the chamber “to come in the near future and see what is there and what we are talking about”.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
