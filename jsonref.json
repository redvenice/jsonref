He starts out conning his crofter mother about his exploits in battle, but his stories are all nicked from old war movies.         Overblown, over indulgent and well over three hours long, David Hare’s exuberant reinvention of Henrik Ibsen’s Peer Gynt as a wayward Scot won’t be everyone’s idea of a fun night out, writes Patrick Marmion         But I loved it for its outlandish ambition, carefree theatricality and aphoristic wit and wisdom, writes Patrick MarmionAnd so begins a lifetime of fibbing and trying on different ideas and attitudes in an epic quest for elusive self-knowledge. It sees Peter become a billionaire arms trader and, eventually, a cantankerous spiritual nomad.Following Ibsen’s 1876 verse odyssey, Hare explores Peter’s life as a metaphor for the way we live now, obsessed as we are by fantasies of self-realisation. But it’s also about how that leaves us chasing shadows. ‘Life,’ as Peter laments at one point, ‘is a hell of a price to pay for being born.’Like Hare’s writing in verse, McArdle’s tirelessly inventive and gorgeously abrasive performance sees Peter dragging himself through his existence by plugging into his libido and unleashing his restless life force.At his lowest ebb - his mother’s deathbed - he becomes enraptured by a vision of heaven as a celestial tea party complete with lemon drizzle cake. Shameful highs, meanwhile, see him lording it over rich and famous sycophants on his Florida golf course. ‘I feel sorry for people who don’t have an adjective,’ he declares, before drooling over his own descriptor: ‘Gyntian’.Equal parts social satire, existential meditation and unbridled shaggy dog story, Jonathan Kent’s flamboyant production with song and dance lifts its leg and makes its mark on just about any subject going. It may defeat sceptics and wear out the willing, but this is swashbuckling theatre, kicking around the sort of big ideas that scare off lesser writers.         I also loved the extravagant adventure of our renamed hero ‘Peter’, played by James McArdle, writes Patrick MarmionIt is ingeniously staged on Richard Hudson’s set of a gorse-covered Highland knoll with changing projections of sky and sea beyond.And there are peachy cameos, including Ann Louise Ross as Peter’s scoffing mother and Guy Henry as a sprightly Angel of Death.If you have an appetite for such excess, you can also catch it at this year’s Edinburgh International Festival.  Midsummer is perfect for a night outdoorsBy Melanie McDonaghA Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream (Shakespeare\u0027s Globe)Verdict: Three-parts pantoRating:  Regent\u0027s Park Open Air TheatreVerdict: Dark Magic Rating:  Jellyfish (National Theatre Dorfman)Verdict: Doesn\u0027t wobble on the tough issuesRating: We\u0027re spoilt for choice when it comes to productions of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, with three of them in London alone.But it’s outdoor theatre that comes into its own, weather allowing, in the summer.You start with the gathering of Athenian nobles while it’s light, and as darkness falls you enter the enchanted world of fairies in the forest and the anarchy of dreams.         Amber Jones pictured as Titania at the Open Air Theatre in a performanceIt’s the ideal play, then, for Shakespeare’s Globe and the Open Air Theatre. But these are very different productions (though at both the audience has a ball).Sean Holmes’s production at the Globe is as close as you’ll get to Shakespeare as panto. Every double entendre is exploited, no chance of bump and grind missed, the opportunities for gender swapping joyfully exploited. It’s a riot of colour and filthy fun, and Jocelyn Jee Esien is a bouncy Bottom dressed as a pinata — but Shakespeare gets lost on the way.It’s not clear why Peter Bourke’s Theseus is a pink parody of a South American generalissimo, when he needs authority. Why is Titania’s bower a recycling bin? Why do all the characters get a go at playing Puck? And why do we struggle to hear the words? With planes overhead you need decent diction and terrific projection.Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre works its magic for Dominic Hill’s production. But it has a dark side. The changeling child is the creepiest doll you’ve ever seen, Rachael Canning’s big arachnid fairies are the stuff of nightmares, Kieran Hill’s Theseus is a thug and Myra McFadyen sits on Oberon’s knee like a sinister Scottish ventriloquist’s doll.Yet it’s joyous stuff. Michael Elcock is a dishy Lysander. As for Gareth Snook’s Welsh take on the man nervously in charge of the tradesmen actors, it’s funny even before he opens his mouth.         The Jellyfish is perhaps the most life-affirming play in town, yet it’s about disability, Down’s syndrome and prejudice, writes Melanie McDonagh         know, I know but this play, written by Ben Weatherill for Sarah Gordy, is so true, tender and funny, it’s hard not to be captivated, writes Melanie McDonaghYou can follow the plot and hear the words. Hooray.The Jellyfish is perhaps the most life-affirming play in town, yet it’s about disability, Down’s syndrome and prejudice. I know, I know but this play, written by Ben Weatherill for Sarah Gordy, is so true, tender and funny, it’s hard not to be captivated.In this terrific cast of four, the focus is on Sarah Gordy as Kelly. She’s got Down’s and she’s got star quality.Perhaps because she doesn’t have to try to represent someone with Down’s, she plays true. Certainly, she is terrifyingly blunt. ‘Will you kiss me?’ she asks her nervous would-be boyfriend, Neil, played with unbearable niceness by Sion Daniel Young. That’s how she is: cutting straight to the heart of things, whether it’s asking Neil to have sex, or her mother if she’d have aborted her if she’d had a test. Her jokes are filthy.         In this terrific cast of four, the focus is on Sarah Gordy as Kelly. She’s got Down’s and she’s got star quality, writes Melanie McDonaghThis play, too, is explosively direct on the taboo subjects. Kelly’s mother sets up a fabulously comic date between Kelly and Dominic, a boy with Asperger’s, played with poignant particularity by Nicky Priest. His ambition is to have a sex life. But he wonders whether there’ll be a time when ‘people like us’ will be done away with. ‘I don’t want to go the way of the woolly mammoth,’ he reflects.There was a Down’s girl very like Kelly in the row in front of me, with a crop top and blue hair. At the end she punched the air. ‘Amazing,’ she said.  Pi\u0027s puppet tiger earns his stripes  By Patrick MarmionLife of Pi (Crucible, Sheffield)Verdict: Tiger burns brightRating: Motion sickness is tricky to pull off in theatre, but then again so is casting a full-size Royal Bengal tiger. And there’s still the question here of a lifeboat adrift for almost a year in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.But Max Webster’s remarkable staging of Yann Martel’s bestseller about an Indian boy called Pi shipwrecked en route to Canada is equal to all that.Lolita Chakrabarti’s deft adaptation emulates the surreal charms of the book and the film.

Motion sickness is tricky to pull off in theatre, but then again so is casting a full-size Royal Bengal tiger. And there’s still the question here of a lifeboat adrift for almost a year in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, writes Patrick Marmion         But Max Webster’s remarkable staging of Yann Martel’s bestseller about an Indian boy called Pi shipwrecked en route to Canada is equal to all that, writes Patrick MarmionThe dramatic limitations of a man and a tiger eyeballing each other at sea are overcome by having Pi’s relatives summoned in his imagination. A boy of about nine became a little green around the gills and bailed out before the interval on Tuesday.I think he was alarmed by Nick Barnes and Finn Caldwell’s life-size puppet-tiger devouring a papier-mache goat. And who can blame him?The standard of puppetry is War Horse level. Look closely and you’ll see the tiger’s diaphragm lift and fall and its rear leg twitch as it snuffles, moans and roars. With other puppeteers on all fours operating an orangutan, zebra, hyena and interloping rat, this is exceptional, back-breaking work.No less impressive is Tim Hatley’s set that is transformed from featureless white hospital to deep blue sea thanks to projections of waves that crash across the floor and flood it with fish teeming below.And swirling around Pi’s revolving lifeboat that rises out of the stage, you even get a sense of the Pacific’s heave and swell.         Lolita Chakrabarti’s deft adaptation emulates the surreal charms of the book and the film, writes Patrick MarmionWebster proved himself adept at directing special effects in the Old Vic’s The Lorax last year, but Hiran Abeysekera is also a perfect Pi. His innocence and faith in himself and others radiates across the stage and brings the elements together.There are sticky moments and I don’t like the way Martel backtracks on his story in the end, but this should be remembered for the theatrical magic of the tiger who came to sea."},{"url":null,"title":"Cat stares wonder moth standing end nose gently paws away","story":"          Tootie Bunface, a one-year-old British Shorthair cat, sticks her face inside a perspex box housing a mothThe moth lands on the cat\u0027s nose and Tootie Bunface\u0027s eyes open wide in shock.She retracts from the box and looks down at the end of her nose at the strange creature resting there.Tootie Bunface then shakes her head in an attempt to shoo the moth and brings her paw up to her face.The adorable cat then looks up to the sky still confused and finally the moth takes flight.

Among the billionaire\u0027s vetoed plans for the site was this property (shown in an artist\u0027s impression from 2015), which included hi-tech jacks that could raise the home in case of floodSir Jim\u0027s lawyers argue the existing property, unoccupied for some years, is \u0027no longer adequate for modern day living\u0027.The new caretaker\u0027s home would include three bedrooms, a open plan kitchen and dining area, two bathrooms, a lounge area and a cloakroom, and be made of old brick and feature exposed oak beams to \u0027correspond with the aesthetics of the surrounding properties and landscape\u0027.But the Environment Agency who were consulted on the plans have objected to Sir Jim\u0027s plans and claim that anyone living there would not be safe due to a high risk of flooding.They said: \u0027The risk to life andor property, within the development from tidal inundation would be unacceptable if the development were to be permitted.\u0027The application does not demonstrate that occupants can remain safe for the development\u0027s lifetime when allowances for climate change are taken into consideration.\u0027There is insufficient flood risk mitigation up to the design flood level andor no specified arrangements for safe access and egress.\u0027One neighbour added: \u0027Having lived here for many years I can confirm the southern section of Orchard Cottage garden east of The Garden Cottage\u0027s east wall is routinely flooded over the winter months. In addition, further flooding routes are seen annually.\u0027*The New Forest National Park Authority will determine the plans in due course.Representatives of Sir Jim have been contacted for comment.

We find her on “a beautiful new planet” whose marketing material promised “a meaningful new life are you ready?” Eight years on, Iris wonders whether she had been.Rio-born, London-raised Luiza Sauma published her debut in 2017 to justified acclaim. Flesh and Bone and Water looked at young love across the social and ethnic ides in 1980s Brazil, delving into layers of history, both national and personal. Sauma’s new novel, by contrast, is set in the near future, in a world parallel to our own, where charismatic CEO and modern-day pied piper Norman Best offered a select few millennials an escape from their angst-ridden ruts via a wormhole in the Pacific Ocean. Their destination? A salmon-pink planet called Nyx, and a renewed sense of purpose as an intergalactic farmer-pioneer. The catch? The ticket was strictly one way.Iris, though, had many good reasons to take this chance. Her Earth weekdays were spent in endless strategy meetings and leadership courses, and her week nights in the pub, drinking too much on an empty stomach, then eating chips on the bus back to her east London flat. Sauma’s take on graduate working life is bleak, but wonderfully dry. Iris worked for “Freedom \u0026amp Co, a creative agency with outposts in New York and Amsterdam”, where colleagues made overearnest pronouncements on not using hashtags for a change, “just so that brands appear a bit more human”. Told to lean in, be more ambitious, more fist-on-the-table, Iris would bite her lip. “I don’t want to be a leader. Is that allowed?”On Nyx, she lives a life free of such status games – and of salaries and taxes, too. They have “no wars, no conflict, no climate change”, and they grow what they eat, becoming leaner as a result: “worthier. Buddha-like. A vegan!” Iris is delighted: “She could never be a vegan on Earth.” Her fellow Nyxians are a rootless generation of Ravs and Abbys, Stellas and Yukos, whose shifting, transnational accents mirror the shifting, transnational lifestyles they led before. They bond over shared cynicism but enjoy their new roles and relationships, rooted in collective work, even if the enforced proximity often requires Iris to intone “there is good in everyone, there is good in everyone” and even if they all quickly, inevitably, yearn for the promised new recruits from Earth.There is pain in this novel too, real and raw – and here it finds its heart. Iris’s father took his own life when she was a child, and haunts her own recurring suicidal thoughts. Most of her pain, though, arises from a profound loneliness, which Sauma presents as endemic, unavoidable, impinging on every relationship, even the closest: “Eleanor wasn’t one of those mothers who test their children’s patience with constant phone calls. Instead, she tested Iris’s love by rarely getting in touch.”The intrusive Nyx selection process has forced Iris to confront this, probing into her past, seeking out “the person most likely to convince her to stay”. Iris’s encounter with Edie Dalton, the “bold, boyish, sharp” love of her teenage years, is particularly affecting. “The way I felt about you was insane,” Iris tells her. “I’ve been chasing that feeling ever since.”Sauma knows that we all want life to be more than it is that we long for the connections it offers to be fuller and richer. But she is especially astute about the risks involved in human love, and how rare it is that we take them. All those conversations that should happen, but don’t the things we are too frightened to say, the decisions we leave until it is too late. Iris’s last Earth weeks are replete with such occasions: her attempts to say goodbye to her mother and her flatmate Kiran, the time she spends with her teenage sister. Mona was born when Iris was 15 – “too old to be her friend, too young to appreciate babies, too busy counting the years till university when she could finally leave home”. The gap between them, for so long too large, now becomes the most important to bridge.Sauma asks us to consider Iris’s choice. Is it cowardice, or suicide, or the chance of a lifetime? A severing of the ties that bind, or the one way to make them worthwhile? Tinged with melancholy and yearning, this novel is wry and frequently beautiful, and its culmination is surprising and deeply moving.• Rachel Seiffert’s A Boy in Winter is published by Virago.

So what is the science behind them – and do they change our relationship with the written word?But is there really a measurable difference between reading with the eyes and “reading” with the ears? According to an oft-cited 2016 study (Beth A Rogowsky et al), 91 subjects were found to display no significant difference in either comprehension or recall after two weeks whether they had read a non‑fiction passage or listened to it, or done both simultaneously. However, this investigation used ebooks for the reading part, and other studies have suggested that reading comprehension and recall is lower for reading on screens versus print. Since the 1980s, cognitive psychology has consistently established that recall is indeed better after reading (printed) text instead of listening to it, a conclusion bolstered by a 2010 study (David B Daniel and William Douglas Woody), which found that students did worse on a test if they had listened to a podcast of a scientific article on child cognition rather than reading it.Books have the advantage that you can rapidly re‑scan a sentence visually if you didn’t take it in the first time and you can mark passages in pencil or turn down page corners to mark specific places to return to. Audiobooks, by contrast, exploit our “echoic memory”, which is the process by which sound information is stored for up to four seconds while we wait for the next sounds to make sense of the whole. Nor can audiobooks reproduce one of the most thrilling features of print, which is its creative ambiguity: the line of poetry, or the sentence, that is exquisitely balanced between two possible meanings. The actor in the studio has to choose just one, and that is the one that is forced on the reader. In their favour, it might be that the particular cadences and timbre of an actor’s voice in audiobooks provide musical information that helps longer-term recall, just as the visual and tactile information of where a passage lies in a printed book can.That voice is everything, says Jennifer Howard, founding director of the boutique audio studio Sound Understanding, whose recent productions include Samuel West reading astronomer royal Martin Rees’s On the Future for Princeton University Press. “Casting the right voice is crucial,” she says. “Get it wrong and you can really turn the listener off.” And non-fiction is even more demanding than fiction. “In a non-fiction book, the reader must understand and be interested in what they are reading, because comprehension can’t be disguised with vocal tricks and the light and shade of characterisation. So in addition to actors, we work with a lot of broadcasters. They understand complex political or socio-economic subjects and instinctively know when, where, and how much stress to place on a particular point.”The UK’s leading audiobook retailer, Audible, whose customers downloaded more than 3bn hours of material last year, is getting into the “original audiobook” game, having commissioned the likes of Michael Lewis and Jon Ronson to write exclusive direct-to-audiobook stories or “shortform books”. One of their earliest signings was Philip Pullman, who in 2015 wrote a 32-minute short story set in the universe of His Dark Materials, “The Collectors”, saying that he was attracted by “the idea of writing for a voice” instead of a reader. (Audible itself explained that the idea was “not only a way to please current members, but also to bring in new listeners”.) But if an “audiobook” was never a book in the first place, can it really be called a book? Surely it is just a rebadged radio drama, documentary, or podcast, even if it goes on to be bookified. (Pullman’s “The Collectors” subsequently came out as a Kindle Single.) Indeed, the surge in audiobook sales seems very likely to be a halo effect of the huge popularity of podcasts, especially the single-theme longform series such as NPR’s breakout Serial, first released in October 2014, or ABC’s 2019 The Dropout, a jaw-dropping investigation into the story of Elizabeth Holmes and her blood-testing tech company Theranos.If audiobooks are now gaining ground on print, does that indicate we are trying to do more in less time? Although the data suggests that we do not actually feel any more rushed or hurried than a few decades ago, the increasingly fragmented nature of our media consumption, and the perceived mountain of tasks ahead of us in any given day, might be driving people to try to cram in more nutritious brain-fare by multitasking: “reading” an audiobook while doing something else. “The pessimist in me says that in our ‘always on’ world, the disinclination to read is not due to lack of desire, but lack of time,” Howard says. Unfortunately, the science is quite clear that, apart perhaps for a small minority of people, we simply can’t “multitask” at all: when we think we are multitasking, we are really just switching attention from one thing to another in short bursts, a process that is in itself exhausting. And educational psychologists are firm that attempting to multitask harms learning. So listening to an audiobook while driving, or gardening, might be a very enjoyable experience, but we won’t absorb as much. Yet that is still better than absorbing nothing at all. “The optimist in me,” Howard adds, “says that human beings will always seek out new stories and ideas and we should celebrate the fact that there are now so many ways to access them.”A more peculiar problem of audiobooks is that a user whose library of such material is locked into, say, Audible’s proprietary format – which cannot legally be converted into something more accessible such as MP3 – might face unwelcome surprises in the future. Earlier this year, Microsoft closed down its ebook store and informed previous purchasers that all the books they had bought in its own proprietary format would henceforth stop working. This is certainly a kind of innovation: when you buy an actual book, you are not dependent on the benevolence – or even just the survival – of a single corporation in order to continue being able to read it whenever you want. Audible, which has been criticised for practices around charging after its free subscription trials, and the unexpected expiration of book credits, declined to provide any comment for this article. But we do know that the biggest audiobook producer and retailer is part of Amazon, the rapacious 500lb gorilla of the book trade. It would not take a tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracist to suppose that its primary goals lay somewhere other than the championing of literature and storytelling for its own sake.The mood in publishing seems to be that audiobooks are not cannibalising print sales to any large degree yet more likely they are competing with podcasts, music and television as a more passive but still semi-highbrow entertainment experience. Drummond Moir, a publisher at Ebury Press, says of the audio challenge: “I think we can and should be sanguine about it. Just as publishers harnessed ebooks as yet another format alongside hardbacks and paperbacks, audiobooks can be thought of as yet another way of connecting readers and authors. In non-fiction, especially, we’re seeing audiobooks really register with people who may not have the time or inclination to pick up a print book, but devour audiobooks because they are hungry for new ideas, narratives and experiences.

Boris Johnson is the kind of guy who’d don Spider-Man pyjamas and scale a building in order to see less of his kids. Sorry, fewer. Even so, he remains a remarkably typical hero of our political times. “There are two kinds of women,” Harry explains at one point in When Harry Met Sally. “High maintenance and low maintenance.” “Which one am I?” Sally asks. “You’re the worst kind,” he says. “You’re high maintenance, but you think you’re low maintenance.”After a week in which paddle-less Britain has found itself once more caught in dangerous transatlantic currents, it’s clear that there are two kinds of political men. Strong men and weak men. Which one is our most likely next prime minister? I’m afraid Boris Johnson is the worst kind: he’s a weak man who thinks he’s a strong man. See also selective antiracist Jeremy Corbyn, whose unshakeable conviction that he hasn’t been wrong in several decades has left him stubbornly incapable of being the bigger person. See also gratefully submissive Donald Trump fanboy Nigel Farage, who has spent much of the past three years hanging wanly around Washington on the off-chance of a half-hour 6pm burger with the alpha male to his beta. And see also Donald Trump himself, the leader of the free world, who spent about 48 hours this week tweeting like some homicidal 11-year-old Justin Bieber fan about the leaked comments of the British ambassador. Who, apparently, we now let him pick. More on toxic insecurity’s poster boy shortly.Back on these shores, the ITV debate between Johnson and his so-called rival Jeremy Hunt was like watching an am-dram version of Amadeus, with Hunt apparently keen to come off as the Salieri to Johnson’s Mozart. It comes as zero consolation that Johnson may, even in the hours before his triumph, already be writing his own funeral music. On this evidence, rather a lot of the country will be in the coffin with him before he’s finished.Poor old Salieri. Almost all of Hunt’s wistfully exasperated attempts to get Johnson to answer a question – any question – could have been replaced with the howl “I speak for all the mediocrities in the world”. Whatever skills Hunt possesses are entirely out of style.It was reportedly after watching Johnson refuse to defend him that US ambassador Kim Darroch made the decision to resign. He had little choice, especially given the way the political winds are blowing. The weak strongmen are inheriting the earth. Johnson has spent weeks claiming he’s the only one strong enough to get the better of the European Union, yet his first public test saw him cravenly submit to the disgraceful whims of Trump. In the circs, it feels a little unfair to class this move as “pussying out”. What would you call it instead? Penising out? Yes, I believe we saw Boris Johnson totally penis out to Donald Trump.During the 2016 presidential election campaign, the Atlantic asked eminent primatologist Jane Goodall to assess Trump. “In many ways the performances of Donald Trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals,” she judged. “In order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays: stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks. The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the inidual is likely to rise in the hierarchy, and the longer he is likely to maintain that position.” Rather than passing, this political mood has intensified. It is impossible to watch how Farage or Johnson relate to Trump, or each other, or to their own underlings, without imagining the entire evolutionary regression voiced by David Attenborough.Great leaders show, rather than tell, their skills. Yet Johnson never lets up with telling people that he is not “defeatist”, that he will “put some lead in the collective pencil”, that “energy” is needed, that what the EU really fears is a big strong man like him. Mm. I hear they talk of little else in the 27 European capitals. “O Fates, please spare us the dreaded ‘positive energy’ of a guy internationally ridiculed as the worst foreign secretary in memory and the unplayable charm of a surprisingly indifferent orator who knows the Latin for ‘can we just take out the backstop?’”It feels doubly shameful that this gilded overpromotee should have failed to defend Darroch, a scholarship boy who grew up in a council house, but who appears to have drawn rather less self-admiring attention to his own background than Johnson insists upon doing every time his carers let him out. He may use longer words, but Johnson’s sledgehammer self-admiration does not differ materially from the US president’s diurnal reminders that he is a strong, good-looking and very stable genius.In many ways, there can be no greater therapist’s case study than Trump. If – like many of us at times in our lives – you are one of those people who thinks they’d feel better about themselves if they only got that promotion earned more money were more successful in whichever way, then will you just look at this guy. LOOK AT HIM. He’s the actual president of the actual United States of America, and he still spends half his time tweeting on the bog, horrifyingly weakly, about people who should be so far below his sight line as to not even remotely register. What a reminder that it’s really not about how you do externally. Unless you take care of your shit, it’s still there inside, gnawing you to bits, and it never goes away. For all his unrivalled power and immense wealth, Donald Trump is by far and away the most insecure person most of us have ever seen.And it looks like we’re getting our own, small-pond version of him inside of a fortnight. If only alleged strongman Boris Johnson had found some way of taking care of his shit. Instead, we’ll be picking up the tab. Still, I’m sure every Briton will be honoured by the chance to play their small part in the larger story of this one defective, arrogant man. Or, to put it in classical terms we can all understand, the guy who really puts the anus into Coriolanus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe861ce5936d5ea93702b80fd61dccc0266a82ca/164_207_2980_1788/master/2980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bb2025509c6308c01dd813daad00af8","title":"spider man boys normal guys heroes masculinity hollywood","story":"Not all superheroes wear capes. But if they come in many guises, what they tend to have in common is a desire to save the world. And that’s what makes the new Spider-Man movie so interesting: here is a superhero who would rather do almost anything else. He has the godlike powers, the suit, the crowds gasping in adoration. He has a monster to fight and (this being a Marvel movie) a standing invitation to join the Avengers, and turn the gig into a full-time job.But what he really wants is to have a life instead. The teenage Peter Parker just wants to hang out in Europe on a school trip, spend time with the girl he awkwardly admires from afar, and be a normal guy doing normal stuff rather than carrying the world on his shoulders.If this Spider-Man were a politician he would be Ruth Davidson, deciding not to run for the Tory leadership because she didn’t want to leave Scotland and has just had a baby. He is the Prince William of superheroes, visibly conflicted about the prospect of becoming king. Welcome to Work-Life Balance Man, who isn’t sure he wants to make it to the top of the Avengers pantheon if that means there’s no time left for anything else a hero for burnt-out millennials everywhere. You could easily imagine him being the first Marvel hero to take a hefty chunk of paternity leave.There have always been reluctant heroes in popular culture, figures embodying the doubts and insecurities of teenage boys fumbling awkwardly towards manhood. But there’s something especially compelling about this beta-male vision of heroism in an era of wildly overconfident toxic alphas, which has left us suspicious of anyone seeking power for its own sake. And what’s really fascinating, speaking as someone forced by parenthood to sit through more Avengers films than I ever thought possible, is that boys absolutely lap it up.Some adult fans have reacted aggressively to the more self-consciously woke bits of the Avengers franchise, questioning whether attempts to generate more erse heroes would be somehow emasculating for boys in search of role models. But the gaggles of small boys I’ve shepherded to the cinema couldn’t care less if Captain Marvel is a girl now, so long as there are still explosions and gadgets and mortal threats to life on Earth as we know it.The all-female Ghostbusters was as popular in our house as the all-male one I grew up with, because it turns out the draw was always the ghosts, and the football-crazed sons of friends have been as caught up in the frenzy surrounding the Women’s World Cup as they were in the men’s.For these are boys who have grown up with a much broader concept of masculinity, a world where dads on the school run and Prince Harry talking openly about his mental health are simply part of the furniture. My son’s tweenage peer group is currently obsessed with both Netflix’s Stranger Things – whose central characters are a girl with astonishing supernatural powers and a bunch of dorky high-school boys – and the American police comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine, whose wisecracking central character, Jake Peralta, is undeniably laddish but self-deprecating with it. It is a running joke that Peralta’s police detective girlfriend is smarter than him, but when she gets promoted above him that’s all absolutely fine his ultimate boss meanwhile is gay, and the most overtly macho, muscle-bound officer on the squad turns out to be a soppily doting father to small daughters.When a character in Spider-Man remarks of the angst-ridden Peter Parker that “uneasy lies the head that wears the crown”, teenage boys are probably less likely to think of Shakespeare than the Stormzy track Crown, on which he sings about the pressures of being a role model and the toll it takes on his personal life. “I know my only mother wants her son back too,” is an unexpected line from the man who just stormed Glastonbury. And the following morning Stormzy shared a text from his mum calling him her hero.How much of this consciously sinks in for boys is hard to say, for we tend to wildly overestimate the importance of cultural icons in shaping public opinion while underestimating the power of the backlash. This week’s British Social Attitudes Survey, noting an unexpected though small rise in the number of people believing gay sex to be wrong, is a salutary reminder that the tide of social liberalism can fall as well as rise.But the same survey also found a creeping shift in attitudes to men’s role in working life, suggesting that there are good reasons for Theresa May wanting to extend paternity leave to a period of 12 weeks as part of the last-minute legacy she is trying to stitch together. Over a third of Britons now think paid parental leave should be split equally between mothers and fathers, up from just over a fifth in 2012."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2093a8d1ea9a4d1d76a85d136eb3d1c698fd0886/0_350_7740_4644/master/7740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f455145e495adfec172445b2da1afb84","title":"up on the roof pushing cricket to new heights","story":"A lack of space at one east London school didn’t prevent it from putting cricket at the heart of breaktime and giving children the chance to shineCricket matches have been played in some unorthodox locations: 5,730 metres up Kilimanjaro, underwater in Derbyshire’s River Derwent, and among the penguins of Antarctica.So perhaps pitching up on a school roof doesn’t seem so strange after all. When pupils at Hague primary school in Bethnal Green, east London, said they wanted to play cricket, there was a problem – the playground had very little space and no grass at all.“It was like a Victorian yard,” recalls headteacher, Judy Coles. So the school built a rooftop playground, complete with concertinaing cricket nets.Coach Soyfur Rahman was 11 when he arrived in England from Bangladesh 15 years ago. He spoke hardly any English and found the transition a “great shock” at first. He remembers with a smile the joy of playing on the roof. “I loved it,” he says. “I was always trying to hit the ball past the nets and off the roof.”He wasn’t the only one – he remembers that when England cricketers Michael Vaughan and Alastair Cook visited the school they also tried to hit the ball for six. No wonder the school insisted that a soft ball was used!Cricket helped the 11-year-old to integrate. He had played street cricket in Bangladesh and when he started playing the game at his new school he quickly began to learn English. “I was the only Bengali speaker in the team, so that made me learn English quicker,” says Rahman, who is now 26.“Listening to my teammates I started to pick up words. Thanks to cricket, I learned English quicker than other kids from Bangladesh. It also gave me a lot of confidence.”When the staff noticed that Rahman had a special talent, Coles helped him to get involved with local cricket clubs. He also received coaching from Chance to Shine, the charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through cricket.Rahman credits his success to the coaching courses run by the charity. “They really help coaches to get better and show us how to get the best out of the kids,” he says. “Whatever support I needed, Chance to Shine provided. Then Middlesex hired me to deliver what I’d learned.”He says the charity’s support of young people is transformative, and helps to put them on the right path. “Rather than hanging round on the street, they can play cricket and take a different direction in their lives,” he says.NatWest has been supporting cricket for almost 40 years. It works with Chance to Shine to help create opportunities such as Rahman’s, and keep programmes like this free of charge – something Rahman says is vital.“Among the south-Asian community here, money is a problem. And if you play club cricket the usual way you have to pay for membership, bats, pads, helmet, gloves, bags and shoes. That’s a lot of money, and would be a barrier for many people. But with Chance to Shine projects you don’t need to spend anything. It’s free. You can just turn up, have a game and go home.”For Coles, unearthing and supporting a talent like Rahman’s is life-affirming. Cricket has been her passion since childhood, when she sat at the boundary and proudly watched her grandfather play.She describes it as “an absolute pleasure” to watch children playing team games and developing their skills. “You get children who start not knowing one end of the bat from another and then become good players,” she says. “They develop such confidence.”She also gets parents involved, to make it a family affair. “None of us have great talent, but we have enthusiasm – and we want children to have fun,” she says.Coles says Chance to Shine is “really good at getting cricket into schools, particularly in the inner cities” and believes the charity’s team are “fantastic ambassadors for the game”.With the charity’s support, some of her pupils were invited to open up the London Stock Exchange with cricket legend Devon Malcolm. They have also been taken to see Test matches at Lord’s and the Oval.The school has built a strong cricket culture and the pupils are enthused by the sport – the girls are particularly passionate about the game. “You see them getting involved at lunchtime,” says Coles. “I’m really proud of that.”Rahman thinks that this summer will be the one where cricket really captures the mood of the nation. “With the work Chance to Shine is doing, and the World Cup and Ashes taking place, I think there will be more interest in cricket than ever before,” he says. “That is really positive.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Welcome to Ottawa – Canada’s bustling capitalMondayOttawa’s most notable building is its majestic gothic parliament and it’s one of the landmarks you can take in when exploring the city on foot. Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don’t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city’s most happening central district and one of Canada’s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill.TuesdayIf the weather’s fair then don’t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa’s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check.With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it’s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city’s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views.Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You’ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves – though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel.At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums – they’re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada’s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35.Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children’s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play.There’s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There’s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours – on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling.You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits \u0026amp Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset.Enjoy Ottawa’s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves – you can even feed many of them. There’s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America’s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting – try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September.Ottawa’s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe’s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67’s play ice hockey. Between them, there’s at least one fixture most weeks, often on Sundays.

But parents shouldn’t try to “relive their youth”, says James Busson, co-director of student recruitment at the University of Sheffield. Instead, they are there to play a supporting role, to help students learn about a university.So how can you all get the most out of the day?First off, it’s a good idea to plan in advance and to do some research. “My parents and I avoided a lot of stress by writing an itinerary,” says Rebecca Hansom, 20, a student at Sheffield Hallam University who has also worked as a student ambassador.University guides, such as the  University Guide, can help narrow down your options, but once you’ve decided where you want to visit, some specific research will stand you in good stead on the day. Hansom says this could include: researching transport and parking times and locations of talks, tours and stalls you want to attend downloading a map of the campus and putting together a list of questions. “It’s surprising how many families come to open days without a plan and, as a result, don’t get the most out of it,” she adds.Expect an introductory lecture and course-specific talks, as well as the option to go on tours of the teaching facilities, student union or accommodation – but don’t feel like you’re a “slave to a schedule”, says Richard Harvey, the academic in charge of admissions at the University of East Anglia (UEA). “It’s important to chill out, wander around and get a feel for the place.” When you’re walking around, talk to students. They’re “maybe less guarded” about what they say about the university and local area, says Karen Packham, a consultant and parent who’s been to many open days with her two daughters.“Engage with student ambassadors on forums and ask questions,” says Busson, “even if it’s just to find out where you get the best fish and chips.”Amy Morton, 23, a recent graduate at the University of Dundee who worked as an ambassador at a number of open days, points out that many university societies have social media accounts on which they will answer questions.Above all, an open day should be enjoyable for all. “It’s not a competitive event,” says Harvey. “Don’t put yourself under pressure to discover everything. It should be a fun day out.”University open daysJune – October 2019Universities mostly hold open days between June and October – see the Ucas website for full listings.Ucas entry opens4 September, 2019Students can now submit their application for university, although most wait until closer to the 15 January deadline.

Others had to borrow money from the DfE’s funding arm, throwing into question their long-term viability.Research by the Price Bailey accountancy firm disclosed to the  reveals that 31 out of 40 UTCs with published accounts owe money to the DfE’s education and skills funding agency (ESFA), including 25 schools owing a total of £8.6m after educating fewer pupils than they received funding for through their general annual grant.As a result, UTCs face an uncertain future, despite many being housed in brand-new buildings, including modern science and engineering facilities intended for the surge of pupils who never arrived.“Eight UTCs have already closed and two further closures are imminent, so unless UTCs can boost pupil numbers and performance, more will follow,” said Gary Miller, the head of education at Price Bailey.Wigan UTC is the latest to announce its closure. Parents were told that the decision to shutter the school had been approved by DfE chiefs in June.“The decision to close Wigan UTC has been taken as the UTC is financially unviable. The UTC has been unable to recruit sufficient students to operate without a growing deficit, which will severely hamper the quality of education it can provide moving forward,” the school told parents.Wigan’s closure follows those of Black Country UTC, in Walsall, which attracted just 158 students out of a planned 480, and Burnley UTC, which was expecting 800 students but enrolled only 113 in the three years it was open. Analysis by Schools Week found that £64m was spent on eight UTCs that have closed.The difficulties experienced by UTCs are part of a wider trend of schools having to return overpayments to the ESFA, usually because of lower than expected pupil numbers. In 2016-17, just three academies in England had to return funds to the DfE, but in 2017-18 that figure rose to 50 academies, including UTCs, with nearly £4m returned, according to a freedom of information response.Price Bailey said it had analysed the accounts of 40 of the 50 UTCs operating last year and found that only nine were operating within their budgets, with 31 recording deficits and one or more outstanding debts to the DfE, including 10 owing nearly £4.7m in general loans to cover running costs and three with working capital loans adding up to nearly £1m.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said she was concerned that the financial struggles of UTCs were “being hidden in the government’s opaque academies system, with figures concealed from parents and the public”. She said: “Too much money is being wasted on ministers’ vanity projects, and the education system is being fragmented in the process. Labour will end the academy programme and ensure schools are properly accountable, and invest in an integrated education system through our national education service.”As part of Michael Gove’s free schools revolution, UTCs were meant to provide specialist education in science, maths and technology subjects, and attract university and industry backing. But the decision to admit students only from the age of 14 meant that they struggled to compete with secondary schools taking pupils from the age of 12.“The problem with brand-new schools, particularly specialist UTCs, is that they are not tried and tested, which can make parents and pupils wary. Faced with a choice between a new UTC with little or no track record and the local school, which might have served a community for generations, the latter often wins out,” said Miller.A report by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) found that UTC pupils’ GCSE results were almost a grade lower than similar students at mainstream schools, with the most able students doing even worse. The EPI also found that more than half of UTC students left after taking GCSEs.But while many have struggled, UTC Reading has thrived and is now oversubscribed, having been given an outstanding rating by Ofsted in 2015 and boasting partnerships with Microsoft. Others have been less successful, with five rated as inadequate by Ofsted.A DfE spokesperson said UTCs remained a “key part” of its efforts to improve educational standards. “Funding that is provided to set up new university technical colleges is based on estimates of pupil numbers. Once the school or university technical opens, this funding is then adjusted to reflect actual figures and, where necessary, we work with the institutions to recover funding.“The department continues to support UTCs to be educationally successful and financially viable,” the DfE said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4fc6ef864e59358e7078107d3b00d868719474/0_370_5737_3442/master/5737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bb1dcbe15bfb874c7b6298df0003c47","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"This week: Hungary’s insect of 2019, and bluehead wrasse courtship and sex change"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82873a899dd4949852828cbde5bc1b46a238a729/21_843_7195_4317/master/7195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=412a076bb3cd282b6ef3b384cdbc888b","title":"are british shoppers ditching skinny jeans","story":"The ever present look is giving way to styles such as ‘mom jeans’ – but sales show skinny jeans are refusing to dieThey are the fashion trend that has refused to die, but there are signs that 20 years after Kate Moss and a selection of indie rockers first sported skinny jeans, they may finally be losing their allure. A new global fashion report, based on an analysis of more than 60m jean-related internet searches, shows that skintight denim is finally losing its grip on the jeans market as shoppers embrace the looser-fitting styles, such as the 90s-style “mom jeans” favoured by the fashion pack for some time.The study by London-based fashion search website Lyst says straight-legged jeans are now the most sought-after cut, with mom jeans – loose-fitting with a high waist and tapered leg – now a bona fide “global trend.” More than 200,000 shoppers a month scour the web for the perfect pair of moms.The Lyst report was based on the page views and sales figures from 12,000 stores around the world, and the data shows a gradual widening of trouser legs over the past decade as shoppers rediscovered flares and bought into relaxed “boyfriend” and cropped looks.Social media is full of influencers and celebrities wearing this season’s most adventurous styles, from the challenging designer “assymetricals” recently modelled by singer Céline Dion – with one voluminous wide leg and one skinny – to the jeans with a side slanting fly worn by actor Ruth Wilson at Wimbledon last week.Then there are extreme denim styles such as Y-Project’s now infamous denim high-cut knickers (the Janties), which also went viral.But Glen Tooke, an analyst at market research firm Kantar, says it takes the general public a long time to embrace such out-there trends: “It’s about people becoming brave enough to wear them.” Jeans are big business for UK retailers: shoppers will buy around 87m pairs this year, shelling out close to £1.6bn. And while Gucci commands nearly £1,000 for a pair of printed denim skinnies, the average price paid is just £18.Having the right styles, in the right size, is a cutthroat business. This week Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s clothing boss Jill McDonald lost her job in part for presiding over what has been dubbed “Jeansgate”. M\u0026ampS sells more jeans than any other UK retailer, shifting 570 pairs an hour every day of the year – around 5m pairs in total. But McDonald failed to buy enough stock for a collection promoted by TV presenter Holly Willoughby, so it sold out – resulting in empty rails in store for almost a month.Lorna Hall, WGSN’s retail director, said the sheer success of skinny jeans meant they had moved beyond being a trend: “Something as big as the skinny jeans is not a trend, it’s a wardrobe staple. It will still exist in our wardrobes, but there are now a lot of people buying into other styles.”But a closer look at the actual shopping behaviour of Britons shows a reluctance to jettison the skinnies just yet.One in two pairs of jeans bought in the UK is still a skinny fit, according to Kantar analysis of the most popular jeans styles bought this spring, with just one in three slim or straight-legged. M\u0026ampS says its £19.50 Ivy skinnies and £15 super-skinny jeggings are still bestsellers.And it is not just a women thing: the ripped young men in this year’s Love Island TV show – like Anton Danyluk and Michael Griffiths – have been sporting super-tight ankle-length skinnies, despite the midsummer Mediterranean heat. Tooke reckons it is tough to forecast whether the new looks will ever be as big as skinnies: “The jeans in the fashion pages make up just a third of all jeans bought – the rest are either regular or skinny,” he says. “There are lots of micro-trends that never make it to the mainstream. It’s hard to predict whether in two months no one will be talking about asymmetric jeans – or in two years if we will all be wearing them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/708c0d30b3525d17ca2d42ab91597523aa23a0b4/466_325_5053_3032/master/5053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d47afb87731cac6309a5275d250751af","title":"summer dessert recipes barbecues smores baked stone fruit scotch pancakes strawberries cream rum soaked pineapple","story":"Keep that barbecue vibe going even longer by cooking pudding on it, too: baked stone fruits with mascarpone, scotch pancakes, strawberries and cream, boozy pineapple and (of course) s’moresFirst make the chocolate spread.

When the sugar is dark brown and runny, return the crushed nuts to the pan and toss to coat. Pour out on to a tray lined with greaseproof paper – take care: it will be very hot and sticky – then leave to cool and harden.Heat a frying pan over the fire, then lay in the fruit cut side down and leave to cook for three to four minutes, until you start to see the sugar caramelise. Turn over the fruit, cook for three to four minutes more on the skin side, then pour over the amaretto and stand back because it will very likely catch light. Once the flames have subsided and the alcohol has burned off, transfer the fruit to a platter and leave to cool for five minutes.Put three pieces of fruit on each plate, spoon the soft-whipped cream over the top and scatter on the crushed meringues and mint leaves.

Cooking them in batches, drop about two tablespoons of batter per pancake into the pan, and fry for two or three minutes. When air bubbles pop on the top, flip over and cook on the other side for another couple of minutes. Keep warm and repeat with the remaining batter – you should end up with 12 pancakes.

You wore stone-washed slim jeans, and you stole a little nine-year-old boy’s heart.Mum would work night shifts as a nurse Dad would be out convincing people to buy his wares. We remained with you in the evenings. I remember watching you in the kitchen. You wore brightly coloured gloves when washing-up: something Mum never did. I was happy to watch and be near you. Then I would go to my room, put on my Transformers pyjamas, and wait for you. You attended my younger brother first and my older brother last, so I knew that every moment of our time together was precious.You would tuck me in and read a very short story. I’d look at you while you were reading, noticing the simple delicate earrings, your eyebrows, your hair, your eyes, your neck. I was immensely happy for those few moments: a precious relief from the chaos, the drinking, the smoking, the violence, the noise of our household. I suppose I was infatuated. I didn’t know why I just knew what I felt.One evening you arrived as usual but seemed to have forgotten something. I watched as you walked back to a waiting car: a green VW hatchback.

You were there, once or twice, but Mum couldn’t afford to keep you on her salary. The last time I saw you, you said night-night to me and gave me a kiss. I like to think that you stayed for a few seconds more than you normally would have done, smiling, cherishing the final moments. You did seem upset, though I now wonder whether I imagined that. I was 11 years old. I never saw you again.Every now and again, I wonder whether you ever think of me and of us.

So why did I encourage him to have more? We were enjoying a final barbecue with our two younger children on the last night of a holiday in Cornwall. Earlier we had dropped Jake, our 16-year-old, at the station so he could go home for a party. What we didn’t know, as we watched another dazzling sunset, was that the party was at our house. Jake was the host. And it had been flagged on social media for more than a week.Skip to the next day. We were driving home when we received an ominous phone call from Jake: “I’m really sorry,” he said, “but Josh broke the overhead light in the kitchen skateboarding round the table.”There were several things wrong with this statement. But, most alarmingly, why were Jake and his friend in the house, which we had locked up and fully secured before going on holiday? Within five minutes of arriving home it became clear that he’d had a Facebook party. A gathering for 25 mates – his story, anyway – had turned into a bacchanalian bash for 200.The carpets were ruined, almost turned black with footprints. There were alarming drops of blood on the walls, which were also filthy, and a cupboard door had been wrenched off its hinges. No room was left undamaged.“Someone’s slept in my bed,” my 13-year-old daughter called from upstairs, furious.“There are cigarette burns on the sofa,” said the eight-year-old, thrilled, as he ran from room to room inspecting the wreckage.There was worse to come. A precious Gurkha’s knife belonging to my husband John’s late father was missing, a bike had been stolen and surrounding the house was a sea of smashed beer bottles. We were picking up fragments of glass for weeks.We live in an ancient farmhouse. It’s withstood centuries of pillaging and plundering, and can more than cope with a crowd of drunk teens. What bothered us – aside from the deceit – was what could have gone wrong, without any adults on hand to pick up the pieces. We have a thatched roof – no need to spell out the risks there. What if someone had needed to go to A\u0026ampE, a 45-minute drive away? Or a kid had fallen asleep and – my personal terror when teenagers are involved – choked on their vomit?To be fair, Jake was distraught. The party had quickly raged out of control. He’d watched in horror as people he didn’t know charged upstairs, ignoring his pleas that it was out of bounds. He said he’d hated the whole night, and we believed him (although it must be said, his timing was immaculate he started sixth form with street cred intact).We confiscated his phone, which was humming with texts (“Sick party” was the gist) and banned him from going out for a few weeks. But we couldn’t gate him for ever and, eventually, we had to make a decision about what to do next.In the following weeks, we’d overhear the odd phone call, along the chilling lines of “so-and-so’s got a free house”. We knew Jake wouldn’t put us through a Facebook party again, but how was he going to see his friends? When you live in the sticks, as we do, there are few places for teenagers to go. Chances are they are going to see their friends and get drunk anyway, and they need a safe place to do it.Taking a somewhat different approach, we decided to be the safe place. Full-on parties at home were off the agenda instead we told our son he could have small gatherings, provided we were both present.“Are you crazy?” our friends said. “Look what happened last time.”But we went ahead, and here’s the thing: over the next two years we got to know Jake’s circle of friends pretty well. They would crash at our house after a party – six of them squeezed into his bedroom – and more often than not our house was the party. Weekends became a mishmash of Butterflies meets Skins.To help make it work, we established some unbreakable rules. The gathering must be banished to one room as far away from our bedroom as possible no smoking inside no drugs. (Oh yes, the thorny issue of drugs. I am grateful that John’s job as a festival promoter gives him the inside track on the worst drugs doing the rounds – things with numbers rather than names: 2CB anyone? – so we aren’t clueless, but having your teenager partying under your roof gives you an unrivalled opportunity to look into their eyes. If something was going on, we’d have known about it.)And here’s another thing you learn when you see your kids’ friends slightly pissed, guard down: they really care for each other. If someone’s throwing up, they will be looked after. If one of them is having a bad time, a friend will take them home. If there’s a relationship trauma, they will not be crying alone.Jake is now at university and recently he invited the old crowd around for a reunion. We were genuinely thrilled to see them. They cooked and sat around the table drinking wine - how things change in the space of three years. Getting to know our children’s friends has given us an insight into the modern teenager they are kind, funny, intelligent and polite. And they are welcome any time. Here’s six things we learned.1 Never leave your house emptyDon’t be tempted to allow your teenager to have a gathering while you’re away, however small and “safe” he or she says it will be. I have friends with teenagers who book a housesitter rather than leave the place unguarded – some teenagers live for an empty house. Always remember that after a few beers, sense, logic and the moral compass tend to go out of the window (one friend had a new car smashed up at an illicit teenage party). And if you need to farm them out, make sure it’s to an adult you genuinely know and can check in with. Beware the unknown parent’s email: it may well be a fake.2 Get to know your child’s friendsThis might sound obvious, but it’s surprisingly easy to lose sight of your kid’s friends once they start at secondary school. Allowing your house to become the party place (with strict boundaries) once in a while means you see them in a much more relaxed setting. Without exception, we’ve found them to be lovely. Plus, you get to prowl your terrain from time to time to see what’s going down. Literally.3 Ban social media invitesSocial media can get out of control fast, and if strangers or friends of friends begin to turn up, no amount of rule-setting will save you. Instead, set a limit of 10-15 friends, which is a manageable number.4 Treat it as a giant sleepoverIt’s easiest to allow everyone to stay, especially if transport links are weak (and few parents relish a 1am pick-up). They will happily crash on floors, sofas, chairs or the back of their car. And, talking of cars, if you have them to stay you don’t have the worry of late-night dangerous driving.5 Hide valuables (booze included)I’m still smarting from the loss of an unopened bottle of rhubarb gin, a birthday present, which was handed out freely as shots at one gathering. We move anything we care about, such as good glasses, put throws on sofas and cloths on tables. I learned the hard way that wet beer bottle tops leave nasty marks on surfaces.6 The key ingredients are beer, pizza and baconMostly they want to drink beer and it does seem to be the best option: the time they drank Jägermeister wasn’t pretty. Pizza at any time of day or night goes down in industrial quantities. Same goes for breakfast the next morning. Get the bacon frying and hand out a few bin bags, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how quickly order is restored.• Him, by Clare Empson, is published by Orion Fiction.Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

A new breed of workplaces can helpWhen Zoey Goto drops her two-year-old daughter off at nursery in the morning, she has an enviable commute to work. For freelance journalist Goto is at her desk and opening up her laptop in under two minutes. The reason? Goto, 39, works from central London-based Cuckooz Nest, which doubles up as a co-working space and a creche, offering 36 desks for the adults and a nursery capacity of 18.Stocked up with toys and books and featuring a dress-up section and a breastfeeding room, Cuckooz Nest, located in Clerkenwell, opened in 2018 and allows parents to book desk space and qualified childcare on a flexible pay-as-you-go basis starting from £14 an hour, or £12 per hour as part of a monthly membership with a minimum commitment of eight hours a week.For Goto, who also has a seven-year-old daughter, this hybrid model has provided a greater level of flexibility. “In the past I used traditional nurseries with set times, and it worked out fine as I was writing a book and was in charge of my own times. But now the bulk of my work is journalism, and I need to be able to respond to commissions that come in and be more flexible. Now I can accept writing commissions with short deadlines, which had always been a problem in the past. If I get a commission with a deadline in two days’ time, I can accept.”On top of the flexibility - highly desirable for a freelancer - is the money it has saved her. “It’s loads cheaper, as the going rate around here seems to be £12 to £14 an hour for a nursery space alone. Also, they give you a month of holiday, so you can take that off, whereas with nurseries you have to pay for every week.” She is also saving on paying nursery fees to cover the time when she is travelling to and from the nursery.Designed to help tackle the twin problems of escalating childcare costs and sometimes inflexible nurseries, a new breed of co-working spaces where rows of Macs are as ubiquitous as kids’ toys are attracting the interest of the nation’s growing army of freelancers, remote workers and entrepreneurs.Lydia Barron, 38, mother of Mabel, 8, and Elwood, 4, was swayed to join Huckletree West, a co-working space in London’s White City, in 2017 thanks to its Kids Studio, a dedicated area featuring books, bean bags and a TV where parents can either leave their older kids unsupervised or book a babysitting service for any younger children. Prices start from £175 per month for 10 days per month flexible drop-in workspace.“As soon as I saw the kids’ space, I thought it would be super-useful as my business partner and I have kids and, though they’re in school, there’s school holidays, and all our staff are parents,” says the co-founder of changing bag brand Tiba + Marl. “So it allows us to work and continue to run the office side of things, but people can come in with their kids. I used to be freelance and eventually had to put my daughter in a private nursery before school, but then you’re weighing up earnings and spending, and it’s not even worth it for £50 after you’ve paid for everything. A space where you can bring babies and kids would have been a game-changer.”Barron says her children spend at least one day a week at the space during the holidays. “They come in and just sit there and draw and read. It keeps them occupied for a few hours.” However, unlike Cuckooz Nest, Huckletree West isn’t a registered nursery. “It’s up to you to keep an eye on your kids,” she says. “Our office is just along the corridor and we can see in and make sure the kids are behaving themselves.” However, parents can book a babysitter.The emergence of such spaces comes as the cost of childcare in the UK is spiralling. The average cost of a part-time nursery place for a child under two now stands at £127 per week, increasing to £174 for inner London, according to Coram Family and Childcare. The former figure jumps to £242 a week for full-time hours. According to the TUC, the cost of childcare for young children in the UK has increased by more than four times faster than wages since 2008.Megan Jarvie, head of Coram Family and Childcare, says it can be a struggle to find affordable childcare. “Prices are high and only half of local areas have enough childcare for parents working full-time,” she says. “A whole range of different families can struggle with childcare costs, but families with the youngest children face the highest costs and receive the least support. For example, a single parent with a young child can spend up to half of their disposable income on childcare costs, even once they are claiming government support. Families are left with few choices if they can’t find childcare they can afford: some rely on friends and family, but others will find they simply cannot afford to work. These costs are really hitting families.”At the same time, the rise of technology has led to a surge in the number of freelancers, with self-employed workers increasing from 3.3 million in 2001 to 4.8 million in 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics. As a result, co-working has become increasingly popular - the number of global co-working spaces reached 14,411 in 2017 and is expected to jump to 30,000 by 2022, according to the Global Coworking Unconference Conference. Could this hybrid approach to co-working and childcare be the answer for this growing army of freelancers and entrepreneurs?Jonathan Lima-Matthews, senior policy advisor at IPSE, the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed, certainly thinks so. “Nurseries are often inflexible to the cyclical nature of contracts, leaving freelancers paying for a service they don’t need,” he says. “Just as in-house nurseries are a very popular benefit for employees, freelancers feel the same way about childcare in co-working spaces.” Plus, he adds, “co-working spaces can bring the advantages of an office environment, giving freelancers people to bounce ideas off, networks that advance their business, friends and access to support”.Cuckooz Nest co-founder Charlie Rosier says the space was born out of her experience of juggling childcare and work after her daughter Orla was born in 2017.“After six weeks I needed and wanted to get back to work – I then spent time looking at the childcare options,” she says. “I found it difficult to find a nursery or childminder that would take a small baby – plus very few offered the flexibility I wanted. An au pair was not an option as I didn’t want someone inexperiencedyoung looking after a six-week-old baby, and finding a nanny that would take part-timeflexible work was challenging. All in all, I couldn’t find a solution that was fit for purpose, and I realised that many others must be in the same situation.”Catering for newborns to two-year-olds, her business’s customer base include lawyers, architects, designers, journalists and PhD students.However, there are drawbacks to working with children on site. Goto admits the noise can filter through from the nursery to the office. “That is something I sometimes slightly struggle with, as we’re literally next door and can hear if a baby is crying, so it can be distracting, especially as a lot of the time you think it’s your own baby and it’s not.”It’s the same at Huckletree West. “It’s not completely soundproof,” says Barron. “If kids are screaming, you can hear it.”While the co-workingnursery model looks attractive, some businesses have struggled to make it work. For example, Caboodle, a company running pop-up co-working with flexible childcare at Windmill Hill City Farm in Bedminster, Bristol, was forced to close following a review of its finances.“Sadly there was no way we could make it sustainable – we were running at a loss,” says Caboodle co-owner Ellie Bowie. “The cost of childcare is prohibitively high, and building in flexibility means needing staff who are also willing to work flexibly and at the last minute. We spent a lot of time looking into finding our own space, but the cost of finding a suitable property, with both space to work, enough space for children and access to outdoor space, was almost impossible.”Similarly, Brighton-based Officreche closed in 2017 after six years of trading, while Entreprenursery, a London-based co-working space with a nearby creche, closed at the end of 2018 after two years of operating when the landlords decided to demolish the building. “I tried to find alternative venues to partner with, but it was too last-minute, and my business was too small to withstand such unexpected events,” says Entreprenursery founder Dahlia Dajani. “It was a very popular solution and I still get calls and emails daily asking about Entreprenursery.”Despite the demise of some similar businesses, after a year of trading Cuckooz Nest now operates a waiting list, and expansion is on the horizon, with a second space set to open later this year which will cater for children up to five years old, and third and fourth sites in the pipeline for next year. Rosier is optimistic: “The childcare sector is ripe for disruption. There is very little flexibility in how most nurseries operate and, as a workforce, we are moving towards greater flexibility.”For Goto, this model is the “future of working… There needs to be more places like this.”Just don’t forget your earphones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa39c0591aba00b2262778d7b11cc4d46b9b0e87/0_76_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a34b6e17bbcee2b476bf1dce9f5c08b8","title":"ed sheeran no 6 collaborations project review","story":"The affable everyman dabbles in grime, hip-hop, balladry and Latino love songs as he zooms down the middle of the road to world dominationIn 2012, I interviewed Ed Sheeran backstage at Brixton Academy. There was plenty of evidence that his career was in the process of taking off – his album + had just spent its fifth week at No 1, he had sold out two nights at the 5,000-capacity venue and was already famous enough that he couldn’t smoke a cigarette out of the dressing room window without bringing the street below to a standstill. But there was nothing to suggest the level of success he was about to encounter.That is, unless you were Sheeran, who already exuded an intriguing mixture of sweet-natured, self-deprecating charm and steely, vaulting ambition. No, he wasn’t surprised + had been so successful, even if everyone else seemed to be: “Because the music I write is like love songs with big hooks, I kind of knew it would end up where it’s ended up if it got the right radio play.” During the photoshoot, he claimed that he already had a career plan in place: two more albums, each named after a mathematical symbol, then an album of duets with huge names. “Then I’ll calm it down a bit.”This writer – who had pegged Sheeran as the new Newton Faulkner, rather than the next Epoch-Defining Ruler of Pop – listened to said career plan in a spirit of nonplussed indulgence: nothing wrong with dreaming big, mate. But here we are, seven years, two more albums named after mathematical symbols and 162m sales later, staring down the barrel of Ed Sheeran’s promised album of duets. The supporting cast has changed considerably from the names he suggested back in 2012: the selection of classic rockers beloved of his dad appears to have been jettisoned – although in fairness, Sheeran has already collaborated with Elton John, Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones – leaving Eminem and 50 Cent, of all people, in the grizzled old Methuselah roles.Everything else, however, appears to have turned out pretty much as he said it would. It’s a tribute to his ongoing dominion over the charts – not just as an artist but as a songwriter, whose donated cast-offs have shown a marked tendency to reach No 1 in 18 countries – that the credits look like a who’s who of the current pop landscape: Cardi B, Camila Cabello, Khalid, Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars, Travis Scott, Skrillex, Meek Mill and A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie. Sheeran’s adoption by the UK hip-hop scene – just as the UK hip-hop scene exploded into the mainstream – isn’t the reason for his success, but it didn’t exactly hinder it either: here, Stormzy, Dave and J Hus line up to take part.Unsurprisingly, the end result sounds not unlike a Top 20 rundown or Spotify’s Hot Hits UK playlist. That should give you an idea of whether you’ll like it – in the unlikely event that there’s anyone out there who hasn’t already made their mind up about Ed Sheeran – but it also tells you how commercial it all is. It skips from acoustic balladry (Best Part of Me, the latest Sheeran song precision-tooled to be the first-dance music at weddings for all eternity) to the straightforward hip-hop of Travis Scott vehicle Antisocial, to an unexpected burst of Led Zep-by-way-of-Queens-of-the-Stone-Age riffage on Blow, to Take Me Back to London, a pop-grime track with lyrics that detail the friendship between Sheeran and Stormzy while offering listeners a study in contrasts between their personas. “Chat shit, get banged … all those stupid pricks on the ‘gram,” snaps Stormzy “I’m back in the biz with my guys, give me a packet of crisps and a pint,” offers Sheeran.The sound skews noticeably towards the R\u0026ampB-influenced end of his oeuvre represented by Sing and Shape of You: if there isn’t a song here quite as undeniable as either of those, then both the Khalid feature Beautiful People, which sets an indelible melody line and chorus amid soft-focus synths, and Put It All on Me, which features Ella Mai and an insistent guitar hook draped languidly over a breakbeat, runs them close. Indeed, it occasionally cleaves a little too closely for its own good: South of the Border sounds perilously similar to Shape of You. The latter also sees the appearance of what you might call the shameless Sheeran of Galway Girl, a man abundantly aware that the general public’s notion of cool seldom chimes with that of record labels or indeed rock critics. Charged with writing a song for the Cuban-American Camilla Cabello, he manages to last barely a minute before breaking out the Latin language of love: “Te amo, mamá.”It’s not the only moment that doesn’t work. You can see the logic behind the Eminem and 50 Cent collaboration Remember the Name – the jaunty musical backing is clearly designed in the image of The Real Slim Shady – but there’s something jarring about Eminem rapping about sticking nails in his eyeballs next to Sheeran repping Ipswich.But elsewhere, Sheeran succeeds in pulling off his patent trick of simultaneously stunning you with the pitiless commercial efficiency of his writing while retaining a certain ordinary-bloke humanity. For all the bragging about his achievements when the genre he’s dabbling in warrants it – put him in the studio with a rapper and it won’t be too long before he starts filling you in on the eye-popping financial take-home of his last world tour ($340m, in case you’re wondering) – there’s a tang of affecting authenticity about the parade of neuroses on display elsewhere in the lyrics. This ranges from social anxiety to fretting about the onset of male-pattern baldness: a reminder that, while Sheeran undoubtedly pioneered the valuable pop commodity of #relatability, he did it by default rather than design.Yet a certain confidence oozes from No 6 Collaborations. And why wouldn’t it? It doesn’t suggest any slackening of his grasp on what people want to hear: the only thing likely to prevent it becoming a vast success is some kind of mass-extinction event. And the only question it raises is whether he’s now ready to put the next stage of his strategy into action and calm it down a bit. Maybe: there’s a distinct sense of the victory lap about the album. Or maybe not. “It ain’t my time to call it a day,” he sings at one juncture. If he doesn’t, it’ll count as the one time things haven’t gone exactly to plan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab91bd2558f894d2d4188fcd8cd1410bc4384f03/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29a29a2ca771a650f53b83ed592de24","title":"stop and search is ineffective so why is it on the rise podcast","story":"The first stop and search Jamal ever experienced was when he was 11 years old.

This isn’t Russia.” Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat MP, told the remarks suggested a “slippery slope to a police state”.Darroch announced on Wednesday he was resigning, saying his position had become “impossible” following the leak of his dispatches in which he described Donald Trump’s White House as “inept” and “dysfunctional”.Those comments drew a furious response from the president who denounced him as a “very stupid guy” and a “pompous fool” and said the the White House would no longer deal with him.In the Commons on Thursday, the Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said an internal Whitehall inquiry had found no evidence the leak was the result of computer hacking.Instead he told MPs the focus was on finding “someone within the system who has released illicitly these communications”.With the Press Association"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/199858d27fb8a3815025a7d17dda40ff59624513/0_145_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c088026320bbcaba4c430594f0940206","title":"share your memories of the apollo 11 moon landings","story":"Do you remember where you were when man first landed on the moon?

The menopause – when a woman’s fertile period comes to an end – can be a traumatic time for many women. The drop in hormone levels can introduce both physical and mental symptoms that can have a significant impact on quality of life. Some women find symptoms so overwhelming that they even think about quitting their jobs.The writer, Rose George has shared her own experiences of the menopause in a  article where she also raised the question why so little is known about it: “I woke up fatigued, stinking and angry that something so common, something that affects millions of women, is still such a medical mystery. Why do we get hot flushes? We don’t know. Why is sleep broken? We don’t know. Why are we the only creatures to get menopause apart from two types of whales? We don’t know.”Not everyone experiences problems with the menopause and many say that it can be a liberating time for women.The menopause affects women in myriad ways and we’d like to find out about your experiences.

The message was to stay calm. It’s not over yet.One of the beauties about Sunday’s final at Lord’s is that history will be made when a new team lift the trophy. And we know New Zealand are not to be taken lightly. Over the past four years they have arguably pushed us harder than any other side in the world and with players like Kane Williamson and Trent Boult, they have some serious quality in their ranks.But after our performance at Edgbaston, confidence probably couldn’t be higher. We didn’t just beat Australia, we battered them. And I think we made an important statement about ourselves as a team, because after three defeats in the group stage when chasing, people had started to wonder if we had a weakness there.This wasn’t the mentality inside the dressing room, I should add. Our record has been so strong in this department but it’s a bit of an English characteristic to suddenly get nervous about these things. That’s possibly a difference between the current generation and some of those in the past: in a big game, we didn’t let any of the wider negativity feed into our cricket.I actually thought it was a good toss to lose and after Aaron Finch and David Warner were out early, the air was being punched in the dressing room. In my mind, that was already game over for them. And we didn’t relent, we just kept our foot on the gas, dominated and didn’t give them a sniff.It was pretty sweet that my close friend Adil Rashid should break the brief resistance shown from Steve Smith and Alex Carey by forcing the latter into a mistake and then using his googly to snuff out Marcus Stoinis and Pat Cummins.For my mind, people in the past have lazily written off Rash as a guy who doesn’t always enjoy the big stage. When you’re quiet, others can form opinions that are way off the mark. But in white-ball cricket he is a seriously determined match-winner who has learned his craft and has that knack of getting on a roll.That’s why much of his tournament up to that point was down to the drops and a missed stumping off his bowling. He wasn’t getting the first wicket that leads to more. Morgan, as captain, plays a big part in backing Rash regardless of this. His googly is coming out really well now and for a lot of batsmen, he remains a mystery.It was great to see him and Jofra Archer walking off the field at the innings break with an arm round each other. Jofra has fitted into this side so smoothly and, unless he needs a break after this tournament, he surely looks set to be in the Ashes squad too.No one wants to see batsmen get hurt but having the extra menace we saw when he hit Carey on the chin – or Hashim Amla earlier in the tournament – is bound to have sown some doubts. For me, it comes from the fact he jogs in and doesn’t jump at the crease, but rather runs through it and whistles it down at 90mph through that wrist snap.It’s not just the pace either but the skills. That knuckle ball to get Glenn Maxwell is something he’s been working on only for the past few weeks but to deliver it at that moment was unbelievable. He bowls left-arm spin and leg-breaks in the nets too and thinks he’s amazing at it. My verdict on this little sideline? I’m not sold yet.But the selectors will be delighted as they have some serious options for the Ashes right now. After Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad they also have Mark Wood and Chris Woakes too. In the past three games Woakes has hit a new level. He may sometimes go under the radar outside of the team but within it, we know he is a gun.Jason Roy is another who will probably be on their radar. We know he can handle international cricket, he scores runs in four-day cricket during the brief times he plays it and to see him take down Australia and Mitchell Starc like he did makes him a batsman they won’t want to face again this summer.The fact the first Ashes Test is at Edgbaston is something else in our favour. People talk about the Gabba in Brisbane and its effect on England players but Birmingham is this and more for Australia players these days. The atmosphere was intense on Thursday. And now we want to thank that crowd – and the huge amount of public support we have had so far in this tournament – by finishing off the job at Lord’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc2456ca8aa3f698f57b3dcb20c1935410d52688/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe737adf7d2c68306a13ac4fc9df2b8b","title":"england uganda netball world cup match report","story":"• England 64-32 Uganda• Uganda centre Stella Oyella sent to sin-binThe England manager, Tracey Neville, was delighted with her side’s opening performance as they beat Uganda 64-32 – not least that they kept their cool in a game that had some particularly physical encounters. Centre Stella Oyella tussled with her counterpart and England captain Serena Guthrie throughout the match and had already earned a caution and two minutes in the sin-bin when she tangled limbs with her replacement Jade Clarke. She was permanently sent off, leaving Uganda with a 20-goal deficit, only six players and 13 minutes still to play.If Oyella looked confused as the umpire pointed her off court, it is because no one had seen such a sight in a World Cup before – including Neville, who admitted to some sympathy for Uganda. “They don’t get out on the international circuit that much, they don’t get to experience this,” she said. “They’re a great team, they’re not ranked sixth in the world for no reason. And at some points in the game they actually had us.” It had taken 28 seconds for England to score their first goal of the campaign, and only 40 for Guthrie to put in her first leaping intercept. But while England were always favourites – they beat Uganda 3-0 in their Test series last year – a tenacious, patient performance from Uganda prevented England racing away with the game in the first quarter.It could not prevent moments of brilliance from England, as when Geva Mentor saved a ball off the back line, and England moved it to Jo Harten – and the net – in the space of three passes. It could not prevent an ever widening scoreline. But it did slow the game down, enough that the frustration was written on Helen Housby’s face.Uganda’s captain and goalshooter Peace Proscovia also put up a strong show in her inidual encounters with Mentor, the best goalkeeper in the world. To say netball changed Proscovia’s life is no cliche – she grew up in the kind of poverty that requires you to walk miles for fresh water and condemns your schoolfriends to forced marriages. She is an inspiration on and off court. But here her team struggled to get the ball to her, and she spent a lot of time looking on from the far end of the court, hands on hips.If it was tempting, on occasion, to switch one’s gaze to court two, where Scotland were involved in a tight game against Samoa – they ultimately won 37-25 – a convincing win will be all that England wanted from this game, not least to celebrate Harten’s 100th cap. Guthrie paid tribute to her afterwards – “she’s an incredibly passionate player and she provides a lot of composure for us” – and England’s famously fiery captain was not bothered at all by the style of play they had been caught in. “Hey, look, I give as good as I get out there,” she said. “I love the hustle and bustle of the game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115747d62f598fd98ccd4daab88731e5735ead4d/121_25_3217_1930/master/3217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f98c983335d6fca624da27c933c971e9","title":"lewis hamilton record british gp win f1","story":"Mercedes driver is in no mood to slacken off as the F1 records tumble and even Michael Schumacher’s numbers are in viewSo long has Lewis Hamilton been dealing in the currency of success there is a sense of late that each successive transaction makes a lesser impact than the last. Such has been the British driver’s dominance he has made the exceptional seem almost matter of fact. At this weekend’s British Grand Prix another record is within his grasp. In a season he has already bent to his will Silverstone may once again fall to a relentless pursuit of success that has driven him since he entered Formula One.A sell-out crowd of more than 140,000 will be watching him on Sunday as he attempts to become the first driver to win six British grands prix, eclipsing Jim Clark and Alain Prost, fellow five-time winners. For the fans here there will be no shortage of appreciation of his talent. Like Tiger Woods at his peak Hamilton is operating on a different plane from his rivals and is embracing the racing with buoyant abandon.Hamilton is now in his 13th season in F1, with five world championships and 79 race wins. Only Michael Schumacher has more, with seven and 91. Hamilton is in every position to surpass the German’s records that most had thought would be untouchable. Since his debut for McLaren in 2007 at 22 when he immediately took the fight to his double world championship-winning teammate, Fernando Alonso, it was clear he would go far.Hamilton believed he would do so, even then. “There wasn’t a moment that I doubted myself that I could do it,” he said. “I think that is ultimately what we all have, that confidence in ourselves. Of course I wanted to win the world title and I think in my first year I wanted to win the world title, straight away, and that was super-ambitious particularly up against a two-time world champion.”It is a self-belief that has proved justified. His first title was in 2008 for McLaren but it is over the last five years that the success has become relentless, with four championships for Mercedes. The last two have come after strong competition from Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari, who at times have enjoyed the better car. Yet it was Hamilton who emerged on top. He is now, at 34, a formidable package. The confidence is backed by a talent honed by his endless pursuit of improvement and the maturity that comes with age.Jenson Button, the former world champion who is now an analyst for Sky Sports’ F1 coverage, drove alongside Hamilton at McLaren between 2010 and 2012 and believes his success has been evolutionary, with that self-belief at its heart. “He seems a lot more relaxed now. He truly believes in himself, believes that the people around him are there to help him rather than hinder him,” he said. “We all know he is super fast but he has learned a lot in terms of behind-the-scenes skills in working with the engineers, working with the car from lap one to the last lap. Those strengths are definitely there now and they probably weren’t when we were teammates. He’s learned a lot.”Button is convinced he could go even further. “He could end up with 10 world championships if he stays with Mercedes,” he added.Hamilton comes in to the British Grand Prix riding a wave of success. Six wins from nine races have placed him at the top of the table, 31 points in front of his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, who has won only twice and is in identical machinery to the British driver. Vettel trails Hamilton by a hefty 74 points.Hamilton’s standing, however, is perhaps better illustrated not by the numbers but in his competition with Vettel. The German took four titles for Red Bull but since going head to head with Hamilton for the last two seasons has simply been unable to match him. When the pressure has been on, as in Germany in 2018 and most recently in Canada this year, Vettel has made mistakes. Hamilton is making his task appear simple because he is repeatedly almost flawless. David Richards, who was team principal at the Benetton and Honda teams and is now the chairman of British racing’s governing body, Motorsport UK, has followed Hamilton for longer than most.“I have known him since he was eight years old,” he said. “I watched him grow up and develop. I can remember the first time I saw the young Lewis as an eight-year-old at Buckmore Park karting track, coming down into a hairpin leading a gaggle of cadet karts and he stood out at eight years old, as he does now.”Richards and Hamilton have discussed the British driver’s desire to create a legacy project that will encourage youngsters from underprivileged backgrounds into the sport. However, that remains a task he will pursue only after retirement, which may not be any time soon. Hamilton recently said he could race on for another five years. If the desire stays the same, and every indication is that he is as motivated as ever, it is easily conceivable he will do so.Richards is convinced more is to come and Silverstone provides an opportunity truly to celebrate a driver whose success, much as sometimes he has made it look easy, deserves real recognition. “Lewis had to work at it it was not gifted to him on a plate,” he said. “He is his own man, prepared to stand by himself – one of the iconic sportsmen, not just in Britain but on a world stage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0bdb3fbaed61c8fb398d5d5a30be492b7050373/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d7f33d31c4876266bb34dd3ce0ff586","title":"comedians guide to edinburgh festival","story":"Sofie Hagen, Phil Wang, Nish Kumar and others reveal their favourite festival spots, from Portobello Beach to the middle of the Royal MileMy girlfriend did a show in Ciao Roma and ever since the owner has treated her like his child. When we walk in, it’s like the prodigal has returned. People are moved from “our” table mid-starter. Italian men dote on me, tell my girlfriend how lucky she is and bring us carbs. Because it’s the fringe I’m too tired to examine the gender politics and just enjoy the food and have a cry in a relatively private corner. Also, gelato! Catherine BohartEdmonstone’s Close, an extremely narrow side street that smells of urine and serves as the most idyllic backdrop for any secret rendezvous. I have always flirted with the idea that reality is fiction and I’m just a character in a Nancy Meyers film. This feels most true when I frolic around the city with a lover and nip into Edmonstone’s Close to exchange hot beer-breathed kisses to the hum of a passing silent disco tour. Olga KochMosque Kitchen is my go-to place for food and comfort. Feeling sad? Have a curry. Feeling happy? Celebrate with curry. Missed breakfast? Why not have a curry? There is nothing like being in the vicinity of religion to make you feel like maybe that three-star review isn’t the end of the world or that kissing that musical comedian isn’t going to ruin your career, even though it probably should. Sofie HagenI love the sea and sand. Subtext: I’m a beach babe for goodness sakes! No, but seriously now, getting in the vast, blue sea at Portobello Beach makes you realise that in the large scheme of the universe your little comedy show couldn’t matter less. Having said that, do come along, it is a really important show of course. Lou SandersWhere is your favourite place in Edinburgh? Glasgow, as the old joke goes. At Princes Street Gardens, I watch tourists mesmerised by Edinburgh’s architecture and ponder Scotland’s big questions. Why is it always cold? And who thought sauce instead of vinegar on chips was acceptable? Susie McCabeSpoon on Nicholson Street guarantees a nourishing meal, which is essential in a month that tests the physical limits of the human body by attempting to run it exclusively on lager and kebabs. The food is excellent, the service cheery, and it’s an ideal place for me and David O’Doherty to hang out, so we don’t have to go to bars with the young comedians and feel like everyone else’s dads who have turned up uninvited to a house party. Nish KumarI always stay in Leith which has my favourite pub, The Lioness of Leith. Benny Abbott, who used to be my boss when I was a struggling comedian made the perfect boozer. Quality food and alcohol, vintage arcade games. It’s my fringe haven. Jayde AdamsOn South Bridge you’ll find Edinburgh bakery institution The Piemaker. The day I discovered it I ate a bridie (a Scottish variation of a meat pie), a macaroni and cheese pie and a cheeseburger pizza. Jack RookeI did so many of my early fringes at Pleasance Courtyard. The place has a truly magical it’s-the-same-but-completely-different quality every year. I’ve not played there in years but the nightmare of trying to get somewhere to sit and sup a pint while being relentlessly flyered, especially when it’s raining, is something I make sure I experience. Don’t go out of season, the empty car park is heartbreaking and spell-shattering. Al MurrayTurn up at the Salt Horse on Blackfriars Street mid-afternoon and occasionally you’ll catch the eye of another comic, sitting alone, nursing a third of a pint, deconstructing their show for the umpteenth time and flustered that someone else has discovered the location of their secret oasis. It is my secret oasis, too. Consequently, and most importantly, none of you are invited. Ahir ShahSlap bang in the middle of the Royal Mile. Look at it! Just look. It’s unlike anything you’ll see anywhere. Thousands of people from everywhere sing, juggle, dance, unicycle, laugh and prance about in costumes. Take a flyer. These thousands of people made something they want you to enjoy. Don’t go there if you’re a cynic – or in a hurry. Marcus BrigstockeWhen I began dating my fiance he visited me at the fringe. We spent a weekend falling in love and galloping about like idiots. We climbed everything, drank original recipe Irn-Bru and visited The Fudge House on the Royal Mile. I’m aware this sounds like a huge double entendre but it’s what we did. Sampling Italian nougat and salted-caramel fudge. The owners of the shop are Scottish-Italian and so is my better half. They are always making a new batch of something and it’s great to watch. We eat till our bellies and hearts are full. Tiff StevensonAt a basketball court in the New Town there is always a group of high-school kids and some seemingly semi-pro players having a social game. Well, it can turn antisocial. A couple of years ago Ronny Chieng, Matt Okine and I went to shoot some hoops and the competition was intense. Before I invite someone to play I always warn them. Loyiso GolaThe Meadows is everything to every man. I have run very gently across the park width-ways then looked at my watch and gone “yeah, probably about 5k”. I have sat with fish and chips and watched the fireworks from the Tattoo. I have comforted a teenager I found crying after the boy in her student production of Titus Andronicus (set in space) went off with the girl playing Alien Lavinia. I have been there at 7am, when no one had enough living room space to accommodate a last-minute dance rehearsal and everyone was still drunk. And I have walked home across it at 5am, as the sun came up, and thought what a stupid, magical, wonderful place Edinburgh is. Tessa CoatesOne of my most treasured Edinburgh memories is going with a fellow comic for a hot-towel shave at a barbers at the top of Leith Walk. Surprisingly, it included having my nostril and ear hairs burned off (I’d not realised they’d existed, let alone that they needed to be razed to the ground). The surprise face, head and hand massage was truly sublime. I’ve never been back, in case it’s terrible now, so instead I sport a beard. Alun CochraneWalk down the cobbled Victoria Street with its quaint shops and you’ll find the treasure trove that is La Barantine. The courteous waiter goes through the delightful menu full of delights. I wave my hand to stop him because I know what I want. The tart with french salad followed by macarons and a superbly brewed cappuccino. Njambi McGrathI spent August 2008 walking up and down the Grassmarket with crinkled flyers. I hated it, then grew to love it. One day I was tired, sweaty, not feeling funny. A man said to me: “I think we went to school together.” The school was in Nairobi, and we had last seen each other 20 years earlier. Another time I had a bag snatched there and chased down the thief like a comic-book hero. I also fell in love with someone I met at the Grassmarket. Ended horribly but great beginning. Daliso ChapondaThe Wee Red Bar is the best place for pulling fit eccentric artists and dancing like an idiot. The DJ always plays my requests, the drinks are limited to cheap cans of beer and spirits and I’ve blocked out my memory of the toilets but it’s the best night out in Edinburgh. Fern BradyThe car park behind the George Square Lecture theatre. Sounds weird but I did my first Edinburgh show in 2006 around the corner from it and got my first agent because of that show. I also saw one of my comedy heroes, Demetri Martin, do his show that year at the same theatre. Lots of fond memories associated with that cobbled, quiet car park. The rest of the festival can go to hell. Arnab ChandaThe Tron was where I first sniffed success back in 2010, the Pleasance Courtyard was where I got dragged on stage by Al Murray when I was 16 and Bedlam theatre was where I played three years with my old theatre company. Venue 45 was where I first performed with my school and decided this was what I wanted to do with my life and Queen Dome, where I return this year, was where I performed my favourite show This Means War! in 2012. Top of everything though is City Cafe where I’ll visit once to get an artery-hardening meal when I need a deep-fried pick-me-up. Nick HelmThe Cineworld complex at Fountain Park. Food, drink, Imax … everything a hardened performer could ever need to take their mind off whatever car crash is going on in their head. Matinees, evening performances and late nights. Do one. Do two. Do my personal record of five. Last year, I asked if I could stage one of my shows there. I’m not kidding. They said no, which in my book is yet another reason to love them. Adam RichesThere are no festival-related events at the Vue Cinema at the Omni Centre. It’s just films that don’t care if they get a three-star review that reads like a four. During the week there’s almost no one there so you can sit in a giant, air-conditioned room by yourself, in a soft, supportive chair, and watch really famous people pretend to be something they’re not. Which is a lovely distraction from talking to not-famous people pretending to be themselves.

As Brown recalled in a WNYC interview last month, Reiter said he had talked to many reporters and told them precisely where to find damning evidence against Epstein. But nothing ever came of it.“He was convinced that a lot of media had squashed the story and he was fed up,” she said.Reiter warned Brown what would happen were she to continue digging: “Somebody’s going to call your publisher and the next thing you know you are going to be assigned to the obituaries department.”Brown did not heed his warning. She flung herself at the investigation and eventually persuaded Reiter to go on record. Her resulting, award-winning three-part series last November exposed a vast operation in which 80 potential victims were identified, some as young as 13 and 14 at the time of the alleged abuse. She persuaded eight to tell their stories.Brown also exposed a government cover-up in which Epstein got away with an exceptionally light sentence that saw him serve only 13 months in jail. She discovered that a “non-prosecution agreement” had been negotiated secretly in 2008 by the then top federal prosecutor in Miami, Alexander Acosta, that gave Epstein and his co-conspirators immunity from federal prosecution.In 2017, Acosta was appointed by Donald Trump as labor secretary, a post that ironically is responsible for combating sex trafficking.The media’s handling – or mishandling – of the Epstein affair is a story of extremes. It is a heartwarming success story, of how one intrepid reporter pierced the veil of secrecy and found the truth. Brown’s coverage has had consequences: Epstein was arrested last Saturday and indicted on new sex trafficking charges by New York prosecutors who praised her work. In the fallout, Acosta was forced to resign.But there is also a less cheerful narrative. Why did the police chief’s appeals to the media fall on deaf ears? Why would so many years pass before the shocking extent of Epstein’s crimes and Acosta’s sweetheart deal were revealed by a local newspaper with severely limited resources?In fact, the two extremes of the story are directly linked: Brown told WNYC one of the reasons she began looking into Epstein was that she was puzzled about the public silence surrounding him.“There really was nobody pursuing this at all,” she said. “That was one of the things that intrigued me about this case. Why isn’t anyone standing up and screaming?”That silence stretches all the way back to 2003, when Vicky Ward wrote a profile of Epstein for Vanity Fair. During her reporting, she was introduced to a mother and her two daughters from Phoenix, Arizona who alleged Epstein assaulted the girls, one of whom was 16 at the time.Ward told the  she spent a lot of time with the family discussing whether they should go public.“They were frightened,” she said. “The mother told me that every night when she walked the dog she looked over her shoulder.”Eventually, the women agreed to go on the record, Ward said, and when Epstein was told about their accounts he went “berserk”. Epstein had already threatened to get a witch doctor to put a curse on Ward’s unborn children – she was pregnant with twins at the time – and now he campaigned to stop Vanity Fair publishing the allegations, even turning up unannounced at the office of the then editor, Graydon Carter.Publication was delayed, then Ward was told the paragraphs on the abuse of the women had been deleted.“I was extraordinarily upset,” she said. “I asked the women what they were going to do and they said they would lick their wounds and retreat, as this was exactly what they feared would happen.”Ward believes Carter caved under Epstein’s pressure. She recalls confronting the editor about the excised paragraphs, and said she has a note in her archives that has Carter saying: “I believe him … I’m Canadian.”Carter remembers events very differently. In his account there were legal issues around the women’s stories that prevented publication, most significantly that the women themselves were unwilling to go on the record.In a statement to the , Carter said: “I respected the work Vicky Ward did at Vanity Fair but unfortunately her recounting of the facts around the Epstein article is inaccurate. There were not three sources on the record and therefore this aspect of the story did not meet our legal and editorial standards.”Ward says she has documentary evidence that shows the women were emphatically prepared to go public, including fact-checkers’ and legal emails to Epstein from Vanity Fair asking for his response to the allegations made by both sisters. spoke to the mother of the girls, Janice Farmer. She said all three did speak to Ward in 2003 and told her on the record what Epstein had done, including allegations he had invited her youngest daughter, then 16, to his New Mexico ranch and molested her.“I was hesitant to go public because I was worried about the safety of my daughters – by that point I didn’t trust Jeffrey at all,” Farmer said. “But I did want him to be exposed.”She said she recalls vividly agreeing with Ward along with her daughters for their stories to be told in her Vanity Fair profile. She also said she recalls vividly her reaction when she learnt that part of the piece was not to be published.“I felt angry,” she said. “I felt like Jeffrey’s money, power, connections – whatever – had been put into play.”There is another complicating element to the story. In 2011, after Epstein had gone to jail, Ward wrote a blogpost for Vanity Fair. In it she used language that was strikingly uncritical of Epstein, referring to him as “not without humor” and praising him for being highly knowledgable.She referenced Epstein’s sex crimes as “sexual peccadilloes” and referred to her 2003 Vanity Fair profile of him, saying it had alluded to his sexual relationships with young women but “didn’t really go there, focusing instead on … how Jeffrey made his money”.The piece went on: “This is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite whom to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead.” put this blogpost to Ward and she said she regretted writing it. At that point, she said, the victims she had interviewed were not willing to talk. But nonetheless, “this blog did not need to be written – here I am toeing the Vanity Fair party line”.Fast forward to 2007, when Acosta reached his bizarrely lenient plea deal with Epstein. By then, investigators had identified 35 potential victims who said they had been lured into Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion and sexually assaulted.Yet records obtained by the Miami Herald showed prosecutors led by Acosta actively worked with Epstein’s attorneys to minimize media coverage.One of Acosta’s prosecutors wrote in an email to Jay Lefkowitz, an Epstein lawyer: “On an ‘avoid the press’ note … I can file the charge in district court in Miami which will hopefully cut the press coverage significantly. Do you want to check that out?”That Acosta felt that he had to resign on Friday was an indication that the collective failure of US media to grapple with a story of serial sex trafficking and abuse that had been hiding in plain sight for years no longer holds true. In the wake of Brown’s exemplary reporting, the rest of the American media has fallen in line. Acosta paid the price.Mary Angela Bock, associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s school of journalism, said #MeToo had dented the prevailing patriarchy that has existed in newsrooms for decades and that had led to sexual crimes being overlooked as merely “the way of the world”.“#MeToo has led to greater awareness among journalists that this is not OK,” she said. “This is not ‘boys being boys’. This is rape and sexual exploitation of children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d073ad875cfeb144496faa6f88c0e5323d0e6332/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06e79aec184657218e8552c69cbbfb18","title":"china taiwan sanctions us firms military sales","story":"China has said it will impose sanctions on US firms involved in a deal to sell $2.2bn worth of tanks, missiles and related equipment to Taiwan, saying it harmed China’s sovereignty and national security.The Pentagon said on Monday the US state department had approved the sale of the weapons requested by Taiwan, including 108 General Dynamics Corp M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, which are manufactured by Raytheon.Washington said the sales would not alter the basic military balance in the region, but Beijing, a major US security rival with which Washington has been engaged in a year-long trade war, has demanded the deal be revoked.China’s latest statement came as Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, was in New York en route to visit four Caribbean allies, a trip that has also incensed China.China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said the US arms sale constituted “a serious violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations”.He also called it a serious violation of the “one-China” principle, under which the United States officially recognizes Beijing and not Taipei.“To safeguard our national interests, China will impose sanctions on the US enterprises involved in the above-mentioned arms sales to Taiwan,” Geng said.The US state department declined to comment and the US firms involved in the Taiwan arms deal did not immediately respond. It was unclear what, if any, impact the Chinese move might have as US defense contractors have been barred from dealings with Beijing since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.While its relations with Taiwan are technically unofficial, the US government is required by law to assist Taiwan in its defense and is its main supplier of arms.China deems Taiwan a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, warned Washington it should “not play with fire” on the question of Taiwan.He said no foreign force could stop the reunification of China and no foreign force should try to intervene.Tsai was last in the United States in March, but her transit stops this time will be unusually long and analysts said the extended stopovers, in which she will spend four nights on US soil, emphasized the Trump administration’s support for her at a time when she has been under increasing pressure from Beijing.The US state department has said there has been no change in the US one-China policy and that it allowed such transit stops “out of consideration for the safety, comfort, convenience and dignity of the passenger”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a070a9618879d5b972203ebe41a8d089590dc2/335_161_4969_2982/master/4969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=271eca411adccc578c743eec4f68ed8a","title":"colombia poets nadaistas 60 years medellin","story":"The Nadaistas, an iconoclastic group of young poets in Medellín, once sparked outrage but now their influence is felt from the metro to the corridors of powerby  Mat Youkee in MedellínIn a small plaza in Medellín, the teenage poets threw the canon of Colombian literature on the bonfire. Their leader, a thin 27-year-old named Gonzalo Arango, stepped forward to read out the group’s manifesto. It was written on a roll of toilet paper.It was 1958 and the nadaístas – Colombia’s equivalent of the beatniks – were on the verge of notoriety both for their iconoclastic verse and the bohemian lifestyles that antagonised prudish Medellín society. “The Nadaistas invaded the city like a plague,” opens Arango’s most famous poem of the time.Today, however, a metro train running a few blocks from the plaza is emblazoned with portraits of the poets and choice lines of their verse an act of belated recognition from the city that once scorned them.And with Colombian politics at its most polarized in decades the Nadaistas’ attacks on establishment politics and social moralizing are particularly resonant. “Sixty years ago the mayor of Medellín persecuted us for being blasphemers, potheads and ‘verbal terrorists’. Now they’re paying us homage,” says Jotamario Arbeláez, one of three surviving members of the original Nadaistas. Originally comprising 13 precocious poets with no common theme or style, the movement lacked definition but not enemies. When a young disciple was reprimanded by the school vice-rector, his definition was gleefully adopted: “I don’t know what nadaísmo is – only that it’s abomination.”The Nadaistas sought to escape the straitjacket of parochial Colombian life, says Eduardo Escobar, still sprightly at 74. “Ours was a reaction against a society that suffocated us, which impeded our thinking, our reading – even our love.”At 14 Escobar was briefly imprisoned for sleeping with his teenage girlfriend, whom he was subsequently banned from seeing. The pettiness of the charges still rankles as he recalls it today.The movement was also a reaction against the bitter political bloodletting that had consumed much of rural Colombia following the 1948 assassination of the socialist leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán. More than 200,000 people are estimated to have died in the period known simply as “La Violencia”.“We were witness to the wars between the Conservatives and Liberals and saw how many people died because of this idiocy,” says Jaime Jaramillo, 86, who wrote under the pseudonym X-504. “We were against archaic ideas of thinking and acting, we were young and ignorant, we wanted to change society!”Colombia’s first counterculture movement would go on to win fans including the novelist Gabriel García Márquez, but their influence was also felt on the political level.The opening lines of Arbeláez’s After the War are now displayed on the wall of the metro. First written in a letter to Jaramillo in 1964 – the year in which the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) rebels took up arms – the poem became an emblematic anti-war verse.a dayafter the warif there is a war if after the war there is a day I will hold you in my arms a day after the war if there is a warif after the war there is a dayif after the war I have arms and I will make love to you with love a day after the war if there is a war if after the war there is a day if after the war there is love and if there is what it takes to make loveTranslated by Nicolás SuescúnFive decades later, it was a second generation Nadaista, Humberto de la Calle, who successfully negotiated the end of the conflict with the Farc as the government’s chief negotiator in peace talks in Cuba.De la Calle credits the group with his political development. “Nadaísmo taught me never to swallow anything whole, to avoid dogmas and to listen to others,” he says. “That sense of irony and pessimism helped me in Havana … and I think it would be useful right now as our society becomes increasingly hateful.”“I suffered one of the most thunderous defeats in Colombian electoral history,” says De la Calle with a laugh. He sees President Iván Duque’s proposals to renegotiate aspects of the peace deal as having the potential to deepen political isions.The remaining Nadaistas continue their 60-year struggle. Jaramillo is one of the country’s leading historians and teaches poetry workshops in a Medellín library. Arbeláez continues to appear at book fairs around the world. Escobar spent 2018 rereading Latin American Marxist texts in preparation for a new book and last year was reunited with his teenage girlfriend. They plan to marry.Belated recognition hasn’t dampened the underlying contrarianism, however. “We’ll continue to disagree with the world – even when the world has acknowledged we were right all along,” says Arbeláez."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fb3d69189f05075bcc23b671aeafbc98dbc76e9/0_619_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51be030400a024fc571487e2dba33028","title":"experience i tunnelled under the berlin wall","story":"My real fear was the border guards and Stasi, who were listening for movement beneath the ground and digging their own tunnels to intercept oursIn 1961, I was 21 and studying civil engineering in East Germany. I was desperate to escape to the west the Berlin Wall, which started going up in August 1961, was becoming more impregnable every week. By winter, scores of people had been killed there or while trying to swim across the River Spree. It felt as if we were penned in, with no future at all.I was lucky. I managed to cross into West Berlin using a smuggled Swiss passport. I had to leave my girlfriend, Christa, and family behind, thinking I would never see them again. I’d told my parents of my plan, but not Christa: I thought our relationship would be over. When I arrived in West Berlin, I had nothing but the clothes I was wearing. I got some state support as a refugee, and enrolled at another university, but I missed Christa and my family.By now, border procedures had tightened up, and some school friends and I decided we would tunnel under the wall to help others get out. A friend put us in touch with other tunnel-digging students in need of manpower. We were part of a few successful projects I had the skills to survey the tunnels, but other diggers were medical or philosophy students.We would make a deep pit in the soil and, as a team, dig 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in 12-hour shifts over several months. Lying on our backs, we pushed the spade in 10cm each time, and used a wagon attached to a rope to remove the dirt. The tunnels were 140 metres long, 80cm high and 80cm wide – small enough to dig quickly but big enough to turn around in. While it was claustrophobic, my real fear was the border guards and Stasi, who were listening for movement beneath the ground and digging their own tunnels to intercept ours.Some diggers were shot by the Stasi as they emerged in the east one tunnel was compromised when a girl who hoped to escape was overheard by an informant. About 20 people were sent to prison for planning to escape through it. Christa was among them. I felt guilty, and angry, but there was nothing I could do. Over the next few years, the diggers became anonymous heroes we couldn’t tell anybody what we were doing, not even family. The most successful tunnel – later named Tunnel 57, for the number of people who escaped through it – was dug in 1964. It began in the cellar of a disused bakery and ended, by accident, in a disused outhouse in the garden of an East Berlin apartment building.The day of the tunnel opening, I came home to find a letter from Christa telling me she had been released early, after 16 months in prison. I sent a courier to tell her about the tunnel, with a small teddy bear she’d sent me years earlier, so she’d know it was me.That night, my job was to crawl through to East Berlin and stand in the outhouse to watch for escapees coming across the yard. They were families, couples – people we knew. The mood was quietly euphoric. Soon, a digger arrived with a woman in his arms. “Be careful with this girl,” he whispered, “she is so nervous.” It was Christa. We embraced, but I couldn’t go with her: I had to finish the job.On the first night, 28 people escaped. By midnight on the second night, 29 others had come through. Then two unknown men appeared they said they needed to collect their friend, waiting around the corner. They reappeared with a border guard. Shots were fired between a digger named Christian and the guard as we raced back through the tunnel.In the morning, East Berlin radio claimed agents from the west had killed a border officer. We were shocked. It was a propaganda coup for the GDR and the young guard, Egon Schultz, became a martyr. Christian went to his grave thinking he had killed a man he never forgave himself. In the 90s, the truth emerged: Schultz had been killed by friendly fire from another guard.Christa and I married and had a family we lived in Frankfurt for 35 years, but I was blacklisted and couldn’t go with her and the children to visit their grandparents in the GDR. In 1971, I got a job with an international consulting company, responsible for transportation projects including the Channel tunnel. It’s my proudest achievement, but even that wasn’t without political difficulties: then, as now, some Brits wanted to remain an island.Through my job, I got to see a world I could have only dreamed of while in the GDR. And thanks to the Berlin tunnels, many others did, too.• As told to Nick ThompsonDo you have an experience to share?

The ruling confirmed that the man arrested in the Sudanese capital and extradited to Rome was in fact a 29-year-old Eritrean named Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, who had fallen victim to what may be one of the most embarrassing cases of mistaken identity in Italian legal history.He was found guilty of the much lesser charge of aiding illegal immigration for helping his cousin reach Libya, but was released immediately for time served. Led by Italian prosecutors, the hunt for Mered and his affiliates began after a shipwreck in October 2013, in which 368 people died a few miles off the Italian island of Lampedusa. The next day Italy and its allies in Europe declared war on human traffickers. The goal was to capture the smugglers who organised the crossings. Amid growing public disquiet about the arrival of thousands of migrants on boats each week, the idea gained immediate support.News of the arrest in June 2016, after an investigation that ned two continents and five countries, was presented to the press as a brilliant victory for the new anti-trafficking strategy. The Eritrean was apparently the first human smuggler to be extradited from Africa and regarded as the “Al Capone of the desert” by the authorities.The analogy with the American mobster is not coincidental. In order to capture the Eritrean, authorities in Palermo convinced their EU counterparts to join the crusade on an alluring premise: that the same tactics used to combat the Sicilian mafia in the 1990s could ensnare modern human smugglers – wiretaps and the intuition that among smugglers lies a power structure regulated by a code of honour.But within a few hours of the Italian authorities’ announcement of the arrest, hundreds of Mered’s victims were already claiming the wrong man had been detained. According to the family of the extradited man, far from being a notorious people smuggler, Berhe earned his living milking cows on a farm and working once in a while as a carpenter. What’s more, Berhe did not even resemble the trafficker Mered, whose picture the prosecutors had released to the press: long hair, blue T-shirt, a proud mien and a gold crucifix on his chest. investigated the case, uncovering new witnesses and documents which were later produced by the defence to help prove his innocence. published photographs that showed Mered, the real smuggler, celebrating at a family wedding in Khartoum – giving fresh impetus to claims that the man on trial in Italy and accused of being the smuggler was in fact a victim of mistaken identity.Among the evidence suggesting Berhe’s innocence, including two DNA tests and an array of witnesses, was an article published in July 2017 by the New Yorker – headlined “How Not to Solve the Refugee Crisis” – based in part on a three-hour telephone interview with the real Mered, which revealed he had actually been in a jail in the Middle East for using a forged passport when Italian prosecutors travelled to Sudan and arrested an innocent refugee in his place.The revelations were confirmed a few months later in November 2017 by Sgt Samuel Sasso of the Italian coastguard, who had investigated Mered’s trafficking activity years before. Sasso testified in court that in the summer of 2016, after Berhe’s arrest, coastguard sources confirmed that the real Mered was in the United Arab Emirates.However, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, prosecutors continued to insist the man captured in Khartoum was the real smuggler and began waging an offensive against activists and journalists, wiretapping phone conversations among reporters who exposed their alleged error and the journalists’ sources.Meanwhile, some of the real Mered’s trafficking victims came to Palermo to testify about the case of mistaken identity. They were also put under investigation by the prosecutors, who believed they were covering for Berhe.One question remained unanswered: if the prosecutors had arrested an innocent man, then where was the real Mered?In April 2018, a documentary by the Swedish broadcaster SVT, in collaboration with the , confirmed the suspicions and revealed that the real Mered was living it up in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, spending his substantial earnings in nightclubs while Berhe, the farmworker, faced up to 15 years in jail.The SVT reporter Ali Fegan and the Eritrean journalist and activist Meron Estefanos travelled to Kampala and collected dozens of testimonies from Ugandan and Eritrean citizens who said they had seen and met Mered. “He is some kind of a wild celebrity and no one tries to arrest him,” one witness said. “We can’t just say we heard. I can say in absolute terms Mered is here,” said another.The Palermo prosecutors who led the hunt for Mered not only ignored the evidence but yet again targeted someone who questioned their case, placing Estefanos under investigation – although she had put her life in danger to find the real Mered in Uganda.In the meantime, the Italian magistrates’ investigation began to weaken. In December 2018, Mered’s brother, Merhawi Yehdego, testified before the judge in Palermo via videolink from the Netherlands, saying the man facing trial in Sicily was not his sibling. The week before, a woman reported to be the trafficker’s wife, Lidya Tesfu, testified as well. She corroborated Merhawi’s testimony, telling the judge that the man in Italian prison was not her husband. “I know you have placed my husband under investigation,” she said. “But the man on trial is not Mered.”A few months earlier, Lidya had authorised a DNA test  on her three-year-old son, Rae Yehdego, who she and the prosecutorssay is the trafficker’s first son.“We took a sample of saliva from the trafficker’s wife and son and crosschecked it with that of the detained man,” said Berhe’s lawyer, Michele Calantropo. “The result leaves no room for doubt: the man in prison is not the father of the child, and consequently is not the trafficker Mered.”The DNA evidence reinforced the results of an earlier test on Berhe’s mother, Meaza Zerai Weldai, 59, who travelled to Palermo from the Eritrean capital, Asmara, last October. Analysis showed she was the mother of the detained man.While thousands were mobilising across Europe to demand that Berhe be freed, Italian prosecutors controversially invited to Palermo two members of the Sudanese secret police who had collaborated with the NCA to arrest Berhe, to testify in the case against the man on trial.The obsession with arresting smugglers has in fact driven European democracies to forge ties with authoritarian regimes, which raises ethical questions: in order to extradite Berhe, the UK and Italy struck an agreement with Sudan, whose now deposed president, Omar al-Bashir, is the subject of an international arrest warrant for genocide.“We were told we had to arrest a man who was accused of human trafficking,” one of the Sudanese officials stated. “They gave us a picture and a phone number. We have just executed the order. The detainee told us he was not the trafficker Medhanie Yehdego Mered, but called himself Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe. He also said he was a refugee and that a trafficker had asked him for $1,800 to reach Europe.”At the end of that hearing, Berhe described being tortured by Sudanese police officers.“They beat me when they arrested me, beat me in prison,” he said. “They beat me with a heavy chain and tried to take off my clothes and do bad things to me. I had an ID card with me from Eritrea and a document from the refugee camp when I was in Ethiopia. But they took everything. I had a little money with me and they took that too. They told me if I’d had more money, they would have released me.”The most recent, and perhaps the most crucial, proof of his innocence was a voice analysis of Berhe and Mered, who had been caught on wiretap in 2014. The result unequivocally concluded that the man in prison was not the trafficker.But despite the overwhelming evidence they had got the wrong man, prosecutors still demanded a 14-year prison term for Berhe in their closing remarks last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2c5fc2e9500da74985403e52e9b1d6021731f5/284_116_2141_1285/master/2141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=133f2a412ccca90b2c347877f0c71e37","title":"prussian monarchy heirs reclaim historical artefacts from german state","story":"Hohenzollerns want property and artworks lost after two world wars and Soviet occupationThe heirs of the former Prussian monarchy are seeking the return of thousands of artworks, memorabilia and other historical artefacts from the German state, the country’s culture ministry has said.Negotiations have been ongoing “for several years” between the Hohenzollern family, the federal government and the states of Berlin and Brandenburg over the aristocrats’ demand for restitution.“The talks ... are aimed at finding a lasting solution for different art and collection objects, which are valued differently by the public institutions on the one hand and the Hohenzollern House on the other hand,” said the culture ministry in a statement.According to Der Spiegel, the Hohenzollerns are seeking the restitution of tens of thousands of paintings, sculptures, coins, books and furniture.Further, they want a right to reside at one of several properties, including Cecilienhof Palace, where Allied powers met after second world war to decide on Germany’s future.The restitution negotiations were spearheaded by Georg Friedrich Ferdinand, the great-great grandchild of Wilhelm II, the last emperor and king of Prussia, who was deposed and went into exile after Germany’s defeat in the first world war.The Prussian royals were initially stripped of their properties without compensation after the monarchy was overthrown, but a deal on the monarchy’s assets was later brokered between the state and the Hohenzollerns under a 29 October 1926 law.However, Soviet occupation following the second world war and the subsequent communist rule in half of Berlin and in the state of Brandenburg led to additional expropriations, further complicating things.“The negotiations are about legal ambiguities in the agreement, but also with legal positions that have changed as a result of the subsequent historical events, in particular the measures of the Soviet occupying power and the government of the German Democratic Republic,” said the culture ministry.Nevertheless, a rapid resolution of the talks is unlikely. “At the moment, the positions of the negotiating parties are still very far apart,” said the ministry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6044c82f750bb2d99d6d70962a5bd9fba8b9ae28/0_510_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deeb78d17afe9f69ee170f29dbfaace0","title":"sudan military leaders accused of ordering massacre","story":"BBC investigation includes testimony from soldiers who attacked peaceful protestersThe massacre of peaceful protesters in Sudan last month was ordered by the country’s top military rulers, according to an investigation by BBC Africa Eye.The documentary Sudan’s Livestream Massacre, which analysed more than 300 videos shot on protesters’ mobiles on the morning of the attack, also included testimony from soldiers who admitted taking part in the break-up of the historic sit-in by thousands of Sudanese civilians.Protests against the rule of Omar al-Bashir, the long-time president wanted by the international criminal court, started in December. The sit-in in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, had been going on since April, before it was violently dispersed.Having prompted the downfall and arrest of al-Bashir, the demonstrators have continued. They demanded a civilian government, the removal of violent militia from cities, aid for those attacked in raids and the release of political prisoners.Abdel Fattah al-Burhan is officially the head of the transitional military council (TMC), which has agreed a three-year power-sharing deal with the opposition. Most agree, however, that it is his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who previously ran the notorious government-backed Janjaweed militias, who is in charge. One of the military officers interviewed by the BBC said Dagalo, who is commonly known as Hemeti, was the person who ordered it.Hemeti initially refused to answer questions from the New York Times about the massacre, saying he was waiting for the results of an investigation. In the same interview, however, he said protesters had carried out “unspeakable provocations”, including one who waved his genitals at Sudanese soldiers, and others who allegedly tore apart a military vehicle while filming it. He later said any RSF militiamen found to be involved in abuses would be held accountable.For more than a month, very little footage from the massacre emerged. As has been the case with many governments in Africa and beyond in the past few years, the TMC ordered an internet shutdown. Only when this was lifted on Wednesday were protesters who filmed the attack able to share their videos.How investigators will respond to this evidence, whether they will find the TMC responsible and what that means for the power-sharing deal remains to be seen. The signing of the transition deal has been delayed but according to the African Union diplomat Mohammed el-Hassan Labat will take place on Saturday.In the meantime, a top general announced on Thursday night that a coup attempt by military officers had been foiled and 16 people arrested."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3955268.1562964634!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rapid review ordered after glitch leaves 800 women without cervicalcheck results","story":"The HSE’s chief executive, Paul Reid, has ordered a “rapid review” into how cervical screening test results were either delayed for or not issued to 800 women and their GPs.The HSE said on Friday it had become aware in February of an IT issue at a US laboratory which led to the women not receiving the test results electronically.However, it said it had been assured that the laboratory would send them the results by letter instead, and only discovered subsequently that this hadn’t been happening.The problem occurred at a Quest Diagnostics laboratory in Chantilly, Virginia. The HSE only became aware of the issue after a patient contacted the Department of Health in relation to her missing results.Mr Reid said the review would look in detail at how the communication process for providing results to the women was planned and managed.“While this review is ongoing, we will continue to update the women involved as planned, and to work with Quest Diagnostics to get to the bottom of what has happened, what needs to be done to resolve these problems,” he said.Details of the chairperson of the review and terms of reference will be made available early next week, the HSE said.There was deep unhappiness and frustration in the Department of Health at the latest controversy surrounding CervicalCheck, the country’s cervical screening programme, according to informed sources.Sources said the cervical screening issue was one of the most important considerations for the department and it had weekly, if not more frequent, contact with the HSE about it.However, sources in the department said it was only alerted to the magnitude of the issue about delays in issuing results to women on Wednesday.‘Very disappointed’Dr Peter McKenna, clinical director of the HSE’s women and children programme, said on Friday the HSE had become aware in February of the “computer glitch” that meant test results could not be sent electronically. He said the US laboratory pledged that letters would be posted instead. It was only earlier this month that they found out that this had not been happening, he said, adding that the HSE had been “very disappointed” by this discovery.“It’s an absolute disgrace,” he said. “The cynic in me believes that the information was withheld from the patient representatives.”It was his understanding that the computer system sent letters out to both the women and their GPs, but that when the laboratory agreed to send letters out manually, they were only sent to the women’s doctors. The doctors, however, were not told the women had not received separate notification.It seemed “no lessons have been learned” in relation to keeping patients informed, he

irish uk governments must be addressed d%C3%A1il hears","story":"Ireland’s deteriorating relationship with the UK over Brexit and the “hostility” between the two sides, has caused damage and must be addressed urgently, the Dáil has been warned.Fianna Fáil Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said many decades had been spent building a strong relationship between the two islands and Brexit had put considerable strain on that.“There even appears to be a degree of hostility at times between both Governments and this is not good,” she said.Ms Chambers said the Government had done a lot of work interacting with EU leaders but “arguably has failed to put the same effort into the very important relationship we have with the UK government which ultimately has caused damage and is something that must be addressed urgently.“We must look at the bigger picture and a time beyond Brexit when we want to continue to have strong relationships with our closes neighbour, not only because they are our biggest market but because we have long historic and strong cultural links that are very important to our own people.”Speaking during a debate on the Government’s Brexit contingency action plan, Ms Chambers was critical of the measures proposed. “We still don’t know what type of support package will be in place for farmers and businesses in the event of no deal,” she said. “We still don’t know what happens to the Border when we have to protect the integrity of the single market.”Security concernsTánaiste Simon Coveney, who opened the debate, said the risks of a no-deal Brexit are most acute regarding its possible impact on Northern Ireland, north-south relations and on the Belfast Agreement.He warned that a no deal scenario “risks significantly undermining wider community relations and political stability in Ireland with potential related security concerns”.And he stressed the importance of the backstop, an insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland.“It’s very important that we in Ireland remain clear and consistent on the need for the backstop which has come under sustained attack during the course of the Conservative Party leadership contest,” he said.Earlier this week at a private meeting, Mr Coveney accused Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt of having an “utterly disingenuous debate” on Brexit in their contest to become British prime minister.Mr Coveney described the contenders as “people who should know better”.On Thursday, he told the Dáil that “the commitment of the Government throughout the Brexit process to prevent a hard border remains the highest priority”.Mr Coveney said this summer, commentary would be dominated by Brexit and the build up to September and October and the challenges of dealing with a potential no-deal scenario.He said he would be available through the Dáil recess to brief opposition TDs or address any queries they might have to “ensure that unity of purpose created in this House around Brexit can be sustained and strengthened” in the difficult time ahead.Former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams expressed concern that the Government’s action plan highlighted a risk the UK government might initiate a move to direct rule in Northern Ireland. He called for confirmation that the Government was “implacably opposed” to such a move and would use all international forums if the British attempted this.In replay, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said that “we have always said - the Tánaiste, Taoiseach and myself as Minister - that that would not be something we would ever accept”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It is part of a drive by the Department for Education to address the rise in students who report mental health issues during their time at university.Data released earlier this year showed that the number of students declaring mental health problems on arrival at university has surged.Figures obtained via freedom of information requests showed a 73 per cent rise between 2014-15 and 2017-18 in students stating that they had a condition such as depression or anxiety before starting their courses.Schools should be kept open all summer, running sports clubs, in a bid to tackle Britain\u0026#39s growing obesity crisisMissed Poldark?

ten students get less ddd a level leave university top","story":" 69 per cent of students with DDD at A-level went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degreeUniversities have been warned over degree class inflation as an analysis reveals that seven in ten students who get less than DDD grades at A-level go on to graduate with top degrees.  Of the 3,025 students who went to university last year after achieving less than DDD, 69 per cent went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degree.  This is seven per cent higher than the previous year, and a 73 per cent increase since 201011, according to a major report published on Thursday by the Office for Students (OfS).    Those who left school with less than DDD last year were four times more likely to graduate with a first class degree compared to seven years ago, the data showed.  The watchdog noted in its report that it had observed the “greatest increase in attainment” in degree outcomes for those who left school with less than DDD in their A-levels or the equivalent.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action” so that degree class inflation is “stamped out”.  He called the figures “disappointing”, adding that they “risk compromising the public trust in the high standards of our universities”.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action”Damian Hinds said that quality in higher education must be protected “at all costs” and called on the regulator to demand that universities with unjustified rises provide evidence of what they are doing about it.     The OfS analysed the degrees awarded by 148 universities in England between 201011 and 201718.  It found that four in five of all students (79 per cent) now graduate with either a first or upper second class degree, up from 29 per cent seven years ago.  Almost a third (29 per cent) are awarded a first class degree compared to 16 per cent in 201011. After controlling for factors such as students working harder and improvements in teaching, the OfS said that 13.9 per cent of the increase in first class degrees remained unaccounted for.  The higher education watchdog has previously threatened institutions with sanctions, including fines or even de-registration, if they fail to take action over the issue.Institutions found to be artificially inflating their grades can be hit with sanctions by the OfS, including fines or even stripping them of their status as a university. Secondary legislation will be passed later this year to beef up the regulator\u0027s powers and allow it to levy fines of whichever is greater out of £500,000 or two per cent of the university\u0027s income.   Susan Lapworth, director of competition and registration at the OfS, warned that concerns over grade inflation “threaten to devalue a university education in the eyes of employers and potential students”. She said that the OfS will contact universities with the most significant and unexplained increases in degree classification.A committee of vice-Chancellors and other sector leaders reviewed ways to tackle grade inflation and published a “statement of intent” in May which set out their plans to tackle the issue.They agreed that “strong and decisive action” was needed to tackle perceptions that degrees are being “dumbed down”.Chris Hale, director of policy at Universities UK, said: “It is important not to forget that students working harder, improvements in teaching, investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also all leading to legitimate grade improvement and such improvements are to be celebrated,” he said.Schools should be kept open all summer, running sports clubs, in a bid to tackle Britain\u0026#39s

This came after an initial run during which members of the Nazi Party disrupted screenings by releasing mice into the cinema and, at one stage, attacking Jewish audience members. Censors in Austria, Australia, Italy and France also banned the film in the early 1930s.Many might find Clint Eastwood\u0027s American Sniper (2015) to be something of an insult, but Iran banned the war drama – based on the life of the US military\u0027s deadliest marksman – for being just that. Censors deemed it offensive to its nation.The anti-war sentiment present in Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s Apocalypse Now saw the film banned under President Park Chung-hee\u0027s regime in 1979.Ben Affleck\u0027s Best Picture-winning 2012 drama Argo was banned in Iran due to its negative portrayal of the country.Finnish censors believed that Sergei Eisenstein\u0027s 1925 Soviet silent film Battleship Potemkin would incite a Communist revolution, so gave the film an outright ban.746 Beauty and the Beast (2017)Disney\u0027s live-action remake of its 1991 classic was banned in Kuwait due to homosexual references involving the character LeFou (Josh Gad). It evaded a ban in Russia after being slapped with a 16+ age certificate and in Malaysia after having the references cut altogether.China banned William Wyler\u0027s religious epic Ben-Hur in 1959 under the regime of Mao Zedong for containing propaganda of superstitious beliefs, namely Christianity. While most films go on to have their ban lifted, the country has never given the Oscar-winner permission to be shown.It turns out there are some people who don\u0027t find Sacha Baron Cohen that funny, notably officials in all Arab countries (except Lebanon) who banned his 2006 comedy Borat for being too offensive.Officials in the Catholic country of Ireland found David Lean\u0027s romantic drama Brief Encounter to be too accepting of adultery to be shown in cinemas.The homosexual relationship at the centre of Ang Lee\u0027s 2005 drama Brokeback Mountain saw the film banned in all Arab countries bar Lebanon, where it was released in a censored format.The number of banned films in North Korea runs pretty high, but an unexpected feature on the list is the Tom Hardy-starring Child 44 (2015). Countries including Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus all followed suit.Censors in China denied the release of Disney\u0027s Christopher Robin in 2008 because the character of Winnie the Pooh has become a symbol of resistance against the country’s ruling Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping.Stanley Kubrick met a lot of opposition with A Clockwork Orange in 1971. While the film was never banned outright in the UK (it was withdrawn at the director\u0027s request after his family received death threats because of it), it wasn\u0027t shown in cinemas in Ireland, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea due to its depictions of violence and gang rape. It wasn\u0027t screened in the UK until after Kubrick\u0027s death in 1999.The high-profile adaptation of Dan Brown\u0027s novel The Da Vinci Code was banned in (take a deep breath) China, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Samoa and Solomon Islands due to content deemed blasphemous.The Danish Girl, Tom Hooper\u0027s film inspired by the life of transgender painter Lili Elbe, was banned in Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait and Malaysia on grounds of moral depravity in 2015.After it was decided that Deadpool couldn\u0027t be edited without affecting its plot, Chinese officials initially banned the film citing explicit content. Uzbekistan followed suit as the film violated the country\u0027s societal norms, while it received heavy editing in order to be shown in India.1846 The Death of Stalin (2017)Armando Iannucci\u0027s 2017 comedy The Death of Stalin failed to make the cut in Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan because of its perceived anti-Soviet theme.Martin Scorsese\u0027s crime thriller The Departed hit a nerve with China in 2006 thanks to a line of dialogue that suggested its government intends to use nuclear weapons on Taiwan, a sensitive issue for the country. The ban has never been lifted.District 9, Neill Blomkamp\u0027s science-fiction film from 2009, was slapped with a ban in Nigeria due to accusations of being xenophobic and racist towards its citizens.2146 Fifty Shades of Grey (2015)The adaptation of EL James\u0027s erotic drama Fifty Shades of Grey may not have been as raunchy as some were hoping, but it was considered too explicit for audiences in Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates and Zimbabwe.   William Wyler\u0027s romantic musical Funny Girl was banned in Egypt because its male lead Omar Sharif – an Egyptian Muslim – is shown in a romantic storyline with the Jewish Barbra Streisand, who was vocal in her political support for Israel at the height of military tensions with Egypt in 1968.Paul Feig\u0027s all-female reboot of Ghostbusters was denied a release in China due to censorship laws prohibiting the promotion of cults and superstitions. Not even changing the title to Super Power Dare-to-Die Team (yes, really) could help its cause. Sean Connery\u0027s third film as British spy James Bond, Goldfinger (1964), had been released in Israel for six weeks when it was revealed that one of its main actors, Gert Fröbe, had a Nazi past. It had the ban lifted when a Jewish survivor came forward with the revelation that his life and his mother\u0027s were probably saved after being hidden from the Nazis by Fröbe.The country of Vietnam deemed the numerous murders shown in blockbuster The Hunger Games too violent for teenage audiences and decided to slap the film with an outright ban.2646 Jules and Jim (1962)François Truffaut\u0027s beloved French drama Jules and Jim found itself at the centre of a ban in Italy for its attitudes toward sex. The ban was quickly lifted.Not many people enjoyed 2017 sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle, but the cinema censors in Cambodia sit top of that list. Thanks to the moment that sees the film\u0027s antagonist working from a lair in a Cambodian temple, the Colin Firth action film was handed an indefinite ban.It was a particularly gory death scene that saw Australian thriller Mad Max (1979) banned from being seen in New Zealand as it unintentionally mirrored an incident with a real gang shortly before it was released. The same scene saw the film banned in Sweden until 2005.Milk, Gus Van Sant\u0027s 2008 Oscar-winning biopic about gay rights activist and US politician Harvey Milk, was initially banned in Samoa with no reason given, though it was eventually revealed the film had been deemed inappropriate and contradictory to Christian beliefs and Samoan culture for its depiction of homosexuality.3046 Monty Python\u0027s Life of Brian (1979)The religious satire featured in Monty Python\u0027s Life of Brian was considered blasphemous in countries including Ireland, South Africa and Norway. Director Terry Jones used the controversy to the film\u0027s advantage, putting up posters in Sweden with the tagline: So funny, it was banned in Norway!  Charlie Chaplin\u0027s classic 1936 film Modern Times was banned in Nazi Germany for advocating Communism.Darren Aronofsky\u0027s biblical drama Noah (2014) found itself the subject of a ban in China, as well as several Muslim countries, because it was perceived to contradict the teachings of Islam.Malaysia disregarded Pulp Fiction for release and banned the Quentin Tarantino film scenes featuring drug abuse, explicit nudity and sexual violence.Sylvester Stallone\u0027s return as Rambo in 2008 – which he also directed – was deemed offensive by censors in of Burma who opposed the way the film depicted its country\u0027s soldiers. Officials in China were so worried that adults would assume animated film Sausage Party (2016) to be a children\u0027s film that they slapped it with an outright ban. On the flip side, France gave the film a 12-rating.  3646 Sex and the City 2 (2010)It\u0027s a wonder the first film of HBO series Sex and the City wasn\u0027t banned in Vietnam considering the critically-maligned sequel – released in 2010 – was prohibited there due to a conflict of cultural values.Although brief, the ban on 2004 sequel Shrek 2 was incurred in Israel due to the Hebrew dub added to the film ahead of release. A particular joke aimed at Israeli singer David D\u0027Or\u0027s high voice prompted the musician to take legal action, halting the film from being released until its removal.The Simpsons Movie was banned in Burma due to the juxtaposition of the colours yellow and red, which is considered to convey support for rebel groups in the country.Trey Parker and Matt Stone ruffled plenty of feathers with their big-screen South Park film, Bigger, Longer \u0026amp Uncut, and the comedic depiction of Saddam Hussein saw it banned in Iraq.

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another – potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Supply-side shocks include events such as a sudden rise in the cost of imported raw materials or components, or disruption to the supply chain, which raise companies’ costs.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.\u0026nbsp“Vacancies, while high, are no longer rising. In fact, over the past months, vacancies have experienced a rate of decline that is modest but has nevertheless not been experienced since 2012. So it is not clear that the labour market is tightening further.”Official data, which measures vacancies in rolling three-month periods, shows consecutive declines since December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumAn abrupt departure from the EU may dent businesses’ confidence and therefore their willingness to hire, Mr Vlieghe said. Companies’ response to a no-deal Brexit also depends on how prepared they are for such an outcome, he added, noting: “It is difficult if not impossible to expect businesses to incur the substantial costs to be fully prepared for a scenario that the government says it does not want.”Both contenders to become Britain’s next prime minister have said they hope to negotiate a new agreement with the EU but that they would be prepared to leave without a deal if that was necessary to meet the 31 October deadline.Businesses’ actions will be one of many things the BoE will look at before deciding what to do about interest rates if Britain crashes out of the EU, Mr Vlieghe said.\u0026nbspBut he concluded that the central bank is more likely to keep rates on hold or to reduce them than to raise them in response to “temporarily higher inflation that would result from the weaker exchange rate and possibly tariffs”, and that a cut to close to zero would be his own preference.\u0026nbspThis puts him in the same camp as his fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro, who said earlier this week that a cut in interest rates following a no-deal Brexit would be “more likely than not”.\u0026nbspApart from a smooth Brexit and a no-deal one, there is a third possibility, where a new deal is not agreed later this year but a no-deal departure is also avoided temporarily, Mr Vlieghe said. The economic damage from this outcome would fall somewhere between the first two scenarios.“That would likely involve ongoing headwinds to the economy from uncertainty, while avoiding the disruptive supply-side impact of no deal,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another – potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Supply-side shocks include events such as a sudden rise in the cost of imported raw materials or components, or disruption to the supply chain, which raise companies’ costs.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.\u0026nbsp“Vacancies, while high, are no longer rising. In fact, over the past months, vacancies have experienced a rate of decline that is modest but has nevertheless not been experienced since 2012. So it is not clear that the labour market is tightening further.”Official data, which measures vacancies in rolling three-month periods, shows consecutive declines since December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumAn abrupt departure from the EU may dent businesses’ confidence and therefore their willingness to hire, Mr Vlieghe said. Companies’ response to a no-deal Brexit also depends on how prepared they are for such an outcome, he added, noting: “It is difficult if not impossible to expect businesses to incur the substantial costs to be fully prepared for a scenario that the government says it does not want.”Both contenders to become Britain’s next prime minister have said they hope to negotiate a new agreement with the EU but that they would be prepared to leave without a deal if that was necessary to meet the 31 October deadline.Businesses’ actions will be one of many things the BoE will look at before deciding what to do about interest rates if Britain crashes out of the EU, Mr Vlieghe said.\u0026nbspBut he concluded that the central bank is more likely to keep rates on hold or to reduce them than to raise them in response to “temporarily higher inflation that would result from the weaker exchange rate and possibly tariffs”, and that a cut to close to zero would be his own preference.\u0026nbspThis puts him in the same camp as his fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro, who said earlier this week that a cut in interest rates following a no-deal Brexit would be “more likely than not”.\u0026nbspApart from a smooth Brexit and a no-deal one, there is a third possibility, where a new deal is not agreed later this year but a no-deal departure is also avoided temporarily, Mr Vlieghe said. The economic damage from this outcome would fall somewhere between the first two scenarios.“That would likely involve ongoing headwinds to the economy from uncertainty, while avoiding the disruptive supply-side impact of no deal,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA giant manta ray has been filmed appearing to beg a professional er for help saving her life.The three-metre-wide sea creature is shown swimming up to snorkelling guide Jake Wilton and flipping over in the water – apparently to show him fish hooks embedded in her right eye.The footage, caught near Ningaloo Reef off Western Australia’s north west coast, seems to show the manta ray then staying perfectly still as Mr Wilton gently removes the potentially deadly spikes.The animal – well known to locals and affectionately nicknamed Freckles – then swims away with a flourish as the er emerges triumphantly with the hooks.Monty Halls, a British marine biologist aboard the boat at the time, said: “That manta absolutely understood what was going on. Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him.”Created with Sketch.Underwater Photographer of the Year Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender.

Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not for the first time, Britain’s interests were defended by the Royal Navy.”He added: “When you look at this week’s events it shows that in recent decades we have run down the navy too much.“Our current commitment is for 19 destroyers and frigates supported by excellent offshore patrol vessels.“If I become prime minister, I will review this commitment as part of a wider look at our defence capability.”Meanwhile, Gibraltar has said its decision to help detain the tanker – which was carrying 2.1 million barrels of crude oil – was one it took on its own and not at the behest of any other state.All relevant decisions in respect of this matter were taken only as a direct result of the government of Gibraltar having reasonable grounds to believe the vessel was acting in breach of established EU sanctions against Syria, Fabian Picardo, the territory\u0027s chief minister, told parliament on Friday. “There has been no political request at any time from any government that Gibraltar should act or not act on one basis or another.Foreign Office officials here believe the harassment of the British ship in the Strait of Hormuz was a direct result of the Gibraltar seizure: security levels for ships passing through or close to Iranian waters had already been raised to three, meaning an incident was considered imminent.As well as the Montrose, the Navy has four mine countermeasures vessels and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Cardigan Bay logistics ship in the Gulf.The new clashes come at a particularly sensitive time with tensions between Iran and the West ratcheted up over the unravelling of the Iran nuclear deal, which the US withdrew from last year.The European parties to the agreement, including the UK, earlier this week expressed “deep concern that Iran had begun enriching uranium to a higher level of purity than permitted under the terms of the agreement”.Strait of Hormuz\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

First of all, the pound is likely to drop significantly against other major currencies, as happened in the aftermath of the 2016 referendum.‘Many thousands’ of jobs lost in no-deal Brexit, minister warnsThis will rapidly increase the cost of imported raw materials and components at the same time as businesses have to deal with disruptions to their supply chain as the free movement of goods and services ends abruptly.Additional tariffs will further add to the cost of doing business as will non-tariff barriers such as customs checks, additional paperwork and quotas.Some businesses, such as those which rely heavily on sourcing parts from across the continent, will become unprofitable and inevitably have to lay off staff or even shut down completely.We have a number of forecasts of what this might mean for employment.In December, academics at the University of Sussex predicted that a no-deal scenario will cost 750,000 UK jobs, including 150,000 in London and over 80,000 in the northwest of England.Analysis by Cambridge Econometrics commissioned by the mayor of London forecasts 87,000 jobs lost in the capital by 2030 out of a nationwide total of half a million.Across the EU, around 1.2 million jobs would be lost, according to a recent paper from the University of Leuven. It concluded that Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands would be the worst affected by a no-deal Brexit, with Dublin losing 50,330 jobs or 2.6 per cent of its entire workforce.This week the Northern Irish government sounded the alarm with a warning that the country would lose 40,000 jobs after a no-deal Brexit, primarily as a result of disruptions to trade with the Republic.While there is considerable variation in the predictions, all certainly support the business secretary’s assertion.The Bank of England’s Gertjan Vlieghe pointed to a further problem on Friday: that British workers,\u0026nbsphighly indebted and with low levels of savings, are ill-equipped to deal with the sudden slump in the labour market that Brexit may bring.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has not done enough to ensure integration of trade measures and measures to combat climate change.“The work of the IMF, the World Bank, and others has diminished people power – contributing to a loss of political agency – especially in the global South.“We are witnessing the latest wielding of that power. There is a grotesque ‘gentleman’s agreement’ that the IMF and Bank will be led by a European and an American. \u0026nbspThat’s the gentleman’s agreement that has produced the bizarre spectacle of George Osborne, architect of UK austerity, sticking his hand up to be the next managing director of the IMF.”Confirming that Labour is interested in exploring the Siglitz plan for a Global Economic Coordination Council, he will say: “We need good ideas as well as an unleashing of people power.“People who push back against the current form of neo-liberal globalisation are sometimes painted as reactionary nationalists.“The suggestion is that there can be only two sides - defenders of existing right-wing globalisation and xenophobic nationalists.“But we have to reject this false binary depiction.

The other things obviously are checks at business level, and random checks and controls, and we’ll have to have a lot more of them anyway because of smuggling.”\u0026nbspSpeaking earlier this week, Stephen Barclay, the secretary of state for exiting the European Union, said a no-deal Brexit would do more damage to Ireland than to the UK\u0026nbspbecause 40 per cent of Irish trade travels through the straits of Dover – where there would be serious disruption.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentMr Varadkar’s comments about the UK’s prospects echo\u0026nbspanalysis on the continent.

After months of dithering, he has finally come out for Remain.From now on, Labour is to be an unashamedly pro-EU movement, dedicated to overturning the  referendum result. Once the voice of the oppressed working class, Labour is now to be the mouthpiece of the Europhile political class.Yesterday, having succumbed to relentless pressure from his anti-Brexit MPs, Corbyn announced that Labour will campaign to stay in the European Union and vote against any deal negotiated by the next Conservative Prime Minister.It is a historic decision, one that graphically shows how Labour has lost both its political compass and its moral authority.The move represents a profound betrayal in every sense — of true democracy, of Labour’s traditions, of its heartland voters and of the cause of national freedom. Corbyn has also savagely betrayed his own values, for he has always been a Eurosceptic who regarded the EU as a barrier to national rights.Now he has emerged as just another identikit member of the chattering, snobbish metropolitan elite, which holds sovereignty and patriotism in contempt.Recently there were reports that when Corbyn was considering a change of stance, his tough Chief of Staff Karie Murphy shouted at him: “We’re not doing that. We’re not selling out our class.” But that is exactly what Corbyn has done.In the process, he has torn up Labour’s democratic credentials and made a mockery of the party’s manesto commitment in the  General Election to “respect the referendum result”.Now Corbyn has shown those words were empty. Labour can no longer pretend it has any belief in the ballot box or any faith in voters.The party was created in  to represent working people in their struggle against the political establishment. Central to the party was a belief in national, democratic sovereignty and a profound hostility to imperialism.That helps to explain why, for decades, Labour was so suspicious of the project for European integration. Clement Attlee refused to have anything to do with the European Coal and Steel Community, the forerunner of the Brussels empire, while his successor Hugh Gaitskell warned that Common Market membership would mean: “The end of , years of history.” In , under Michael Foot, the party openly campaigned for withdrawal from the European Community.But all that soon changed. Under Neil Kinnock, the party — regularly beaten in general elections — began to see Brussels as a vehicle for the introduction of socialism into Britain without the need for support from voters. Labour’s rampant European enthusiasm was born, and quickly entrenched by Tony Blair.It was a development that dismayed me.Through much of the s and s I was a Labour activist in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North constituency and I shared his views on Brussels.Indeed, his Euro-scepticism was the only thing I admired about him. But I could not stomach Blair’s servile devotion to Brussels. Disillusioned, I left Labour in .Now Labour’s capture by the pro-EU ideologues is complete. “Labour’s hearts are Remain and our values are Remain,” declared the Deputy Leader Tom Watson recently. The party that once campaigned against imperialism now wants us to be subsumed in the EU’s federalist empire.This shameful step has been dressed up as a political necessity because Labour is haemorrhaging political support, down to just  per cent in one recent opinion poll. But Labour is in decline not because of its stance on Europe, but because of the uselessness and extremism of Corbyn’s neo-Marxist leadership.In fact, by alienating Labour’s voters in the predominantly pro-Leave heartlands of the North and the Midlands, Corbyn’s decision is likely to backfire disastrously.It is estimated that more than four million people who backed Brexit in the  referendum voted Labour in the  General Election. Just as importantly, around  per cent of all Labour constituencies had majorities for Leave in the referendum. In fact, many of the most fervent pro-Brexit seats in  are Labour-held — places such as Ruth Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent North, Gloria De Piero’s Ashfield in Nottingham and Melanie Onn’s Great Grimsby, all where virtually  per cent supported Leave.All these seats, and scores of others with slim Labour majorities, will be at risk due to Corbyn’s new policy. Nor will there be any chance of Labour winning any pro-Leave Tory marginals, which are necessary for a Commons majority.The dangers were highlighted in May’s European elections, where Nigel Farage’s Brexit party beat Labour in a string of traditional heartland seats including Hartlepool, Redcar and Bolsover.As the Labour Brexit campaigner Brendan Chilton put it recently: “A pro-Remain policy would be an electoral disaster for the Labour Party on an unprecedented scale. If this were to happen, Labour may never recover.”Well, it has happened. But the sense of betrayal goes far deeper than electoral calculations. This week Labour has dramatically shown where its priorities lie — not with the traditional working class, but with the sneering elitists of the affluent, pro-EU middle class.Tragically, this once proud movement has become a pale imitation of the Liberal Democrats in all their EU worship and disdain for national pride. Instead of embracing its industrial communities, Labour has retreated into its metropolitan enclaves.And this twist has thrown up a bizarre reversal of roles — Corbyn, the eternal rebel, is now the pathetic stooge of the pro-EU establishment, while Boris Johnson, the likely Tory victor, is the real warrior for British justice and liberty. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why all the cloak-and-dagger secrecy surrounding the godparents to Meghan and Harry’s son Prince Archie He’s seventh in line to the throne and, quite frankly,the majority of us had been standing next to the font, we’d probably struggle to name rumoured godparent Charlie van Straubenzee the following day.I have just typed it and I’ve forgotten it already. So why risk losing the already fragile goodwill of the public by treating them asthey’re tiresome selfie-hunters  It’s like those celebrities who put a “no photos” hand up when you haven’t even got your camera out.Or the ones who tell journalists the most anodyne fact about themselves, then add: “But don’t quote me on that.” As .It reminds me of the time when I found myself as a “plus one” at the wedding of a Z-list celebrity who had flogged his nuptials to Hello! magazine.Post-ceremony, the guests were left hanging around as the happy couple did their contracted, painfully proooootracted photoshoot, so I sauntered off to the shade of the nearest tree to make a phone call. Within seconds, the groom appeared at my side and hissed: “If you’re filing copy on this, I will have you removed.”I was simply calling home to say goodnight to my five-year-old. Harry and Meghan’s disproportionate defensiveness over their son’s christening smacks of a similar celebrity narcissism.The reality, one fears, is that this whole “privacy please” charade is yet another example where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are blurring the lines between “royal” and “celebrity”. Being the latter means you pay for everything yourself.But being royal means you have -hour police protection funded by us, transport and living expenses funded by us, a £.million refurbishment of your house funded by us and your child is deemed important enough to be baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury.And inyou perform the occasional public duty and follow the royal traditions that have sustained the Monarchy for hundreds of years.One of those traditions being the inclusion of godparent names in the royal register. So omitting them from the official court circularis bordering on the non-constitutional.And when the tourist magnet of tradition, pomp and ceremony is pretty much all the Royal Family has left as a bargaining chip with the already hard-pressed taxpayers who fund them, that’s a bold, some might say reckless, move.A recent poll asked, “do the Sussexes have the right to keep godparents’ names secret”, and  per cent said “yes”,  per cent “no”, and  per cent “don’t know”.Don’t know, or don’t care  And therein lies the rub. The impeccably dutul Queen is hugely respected but, after she dies, what then The public may well feel that Harry, Meghan et al can have all the privacy they desire. But in , they must give up all the royal trappings and pay their own bills.TELLY regulator Ofcom has received  complaints from people concerned about the “mental health” of Love Island contestant Amy Hart after she was dumped by “half-boyfriend”Curtis Pritchard.Sigh. With everything going on in the world that’s truly worthy of complaint, how depressing that the type of “boy dumps girl”scenario that’s played out daily in homes, bars, schools, parks and cafes the world over is deemed to be a matter worthy of investigation.Yes, Amy was “heartbroken” and had a good sob. But anxiety is a “mental health” issue. So is depression, bi polar disorder, schizophrenia, etc etc.Feeling upset because someone you met three weeks ago has placed you back in the “friend zone” is not the same thing.Equally, Amy – who has now voluntarily left the villa – willingly signed up for a reality show where she knew full well that relationships are constantly tested and the ensuing responses filmed  .A bit of heartbreak is all part of le’s rich pattern, isn’t it  You feel awful for a few hours, days or weeks , then tell yourself that he she “isn’t worth it”, change out of your pyjamas and move on.Worryingly, Amy said Curtis had robbed her of her future. No Amy – you are your future, and anyone who comes along to share it with you is merely a bonus.Work on loving yourself and before long it will be: “Curtis, who ”THE number of pensioners wanting to flat-share has soared , per cent in the past decade.If The Bloke ever trips and falls under a busI will hopefully be one of them.My friends and I often muse that, one day, we’ll sell our current homes and pool resources to buy a large property that we’d name “Symbiosis House”.There, we would watch Escape To The Chateau, play Scrabble and backgammon, drink buckets of rose and look after each other by bringing our own set of skills to the late le party – be it cookery, gardening, administration or entertainment.We would have company when we needed it, but our own room to retreat to when we didn’t.And best of all, none of us would ever feel lonely.MICHAEL GOVE and David Cameron have reportedly ended their three- year feud with drinks at an exclusive private members’ club in London.Whether their once-friendly wives feel the same way remains to be seen.AS a patron of Help For Heroes, I can’t stress highly enough how important it is to support our Forces veterans.When we needed them, they put their lives on the line for us.And now they are the ones in need of help, this country must look after them. Who could argue against that Yet despite the ongoing physical and hidden injuriesall too many of them suffer, successive governments have failed to come up with a cohesive plan that actually delivers the right care for their needs.So The Sun’s campaign for a small, dedicated “Office Of Veterans’ Affairs” in the Cabinet Office is a vitally important one that could make a vast dference to the lives of, among so many others, soldiers such as Ben Parkinson, , who suffered le-changinginjuries in Afghanistan and now needs constant care. The next PM should put it at the top of his to-do list.JEREMY PAXMAN says he doesn’t miss presenting Newsnight because: “I spent  years listening to people talk b*****ks every night. That was enough.”At least he was paid to hear politicians etc wittering on. The rest of us have to pay for the, er, privilege in the form of the £. licence fee.“GOING in to town” was a big thing when I was in my late teens.We frequented the local pubs, spent hours in Cha Girl looking for the perfect jeans and gathered in cafes for gossipy chats over an exciting new drink called “cappuccino”.Now, according to high streets minister Jake Berry, middle-aged Brits like me are abandoning local shops because we’re either too busy working or engrossed in TV box sets.So he’s issued a plea for us to, “show the high street some love”.Hmmm.

And the direct but illicit involvement of Magic Grandpa himself in what were meant to be independent investigations.Even before that came out, three peers resigned from the party because of the vast numbers of Jew-haters in Labour.One of those to quit is Lord Triesman, a top bloke. He was once a very capable boss of the Football Association. He resigned saying Labour was “instit- utionally anti-Semitic”.And he added that “the experience of le in the party has become sickening”.Even Corbyn’s closest allies among Labour MPs have had enough of him. Diane Abbott, for example. And the Shadow Chancellor, the sinister John McDonnell.Other Labour MPs are sick of being bullied by the convocation of weird Maoists, Trots and Leninists who surround Corbyn. People such as Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray .All of this has helped Labour sink to an astonishing all-time low of  per cent in the polls — at a time when we’ve had the worst Conservative Government in memory. Or at least since John Major was in charge.And now the party has finally turned its back on the people it was set up to support, the working class.It has decided to back the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, junking its previous decision to “respect the vote”.Hundreds of thousands of Labour voters in the North of England will be lost to the party as a consequence, possibly for ever.So the knives are out for Grandpa and I don’t see him lasting much longer. It is now a case of WHEN he goes, not IF he goes. But even when he goes, what can a new leader do with this rabble Don’t forget, the party is controlled entirely by the activists. And those are the , middle-class, liberal lefties and perpetual adolescents who joined the party en masse for three quid to ensure Corbyn was elected leader.They have nothing in common with Labour’s old voter base, the working class. They are opposed to Brexit. They are in favour of Hamas, Venezuela and Cuba. They support identity politics, with its endless hierarchy of victimhood groups.So the likelihood, then, is that a new leader will also come from the juvenile far Left.There are some great Labour MPs who would make excellent leaders of the party — Caroline Flint, for example, or Jon Cruddas. But do they stand a chance any more, seeing how the party is It’s more likely we’ll end up with John McDonnell, an unrepentant Marxist who thought IRA bombers should be given honours by the British government. Or one of his and Corbyn’s proteges.It could well be the end of the party as a viable political force full-stop.Ah well. Time to say goodbye to Jezza. It was fun while it lasted, mate.

And some people may be prepared to tell you it’s eleven o’clock, or perhaps five to five. But I’m not going to do that. No. Not me. That’s for others to say.“I will tell you, beyond all doubt, that it is definitely not seven o’clock, and that’s the important thing, the thing voters care about. And that’s why I think I should be your Prime Minister. Because I will never tell the electorate it is seven o’clock when it isn’t. And, indeed, even when it is.“Does that answer your question, Julie ”GOOD – he’s gone.

I could do with getting out of my head too.My guess is we will leave in part, with a deal slightly weaker than the dog’s breakfast Theresa May put before us. And don’t be too surprised by a general election pretty soon. That will cheer us all up.Never have so many people been let down by their leaders.

As he himself said, his job had become “impossible”.But this whole episode has been utterly depressing, and there is plenty of blame to go around.Perhaps Sir Kim was a little loose in his language, but no diplomat could ever expect his confidential notes to senior figures in London to end up on the front of the papers.The tributes since his resignation certainly suggest that this was the first time he’d put a foot even slightly wrong in his entire career.And the President — who is a friend of Britain — should have realised that when it comes to diplomacy, the shoot-from-the-hip style he uses on social media can have consequences.No newspaper complains about a leak, but whoever undermined Sir Kim by releasing his not-quite-diplomatic cables should reflect on the damage it has done to not just our international standing but to the Foreign Office’s ability to do its job.As for the Boris “row”, it’s unedying to see his detractors weaponising this sorry saga against him.Whatever he had said on the TV debate, Sir Kim’s position was already sadly untenable.Moving forward, the Special Relationship must remain special.Our links with America are stronger than one ambassador, from security to our shared culture.But we must never be complacent about the ties to our closest ally.YOU can see why Labour has turned on the journalists behind last night’s Panorama investigation into the party’s dreadful handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks.The programme was damning from start to finish. It details the most extraordinary levels of racism in all corners of the party and a total refusal of the leadership to do anything about it.Indeed the party appears to have actually tried to strangle worthwhile investigations at birth, and to have actively interfered in the disciplinary process.Corbyn’s useful idiots have predictably turned on the whistleblowers – ironic, considering Labour’sShadow Chancellor once handed a petition to No calling for better protection for those brave enough to call their employers out for bad practice.Hypocrites, the lot of them.It may not be the case that Corbyn himself is a racist, but goodness, he does seem to attract an awful lot of them — and be too thick or ignorant to notice they’re there.The party’s rotten, from top to bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hopefully now with them being back home they can start to process things a little better.When they were stuck in Puerto Rico it was very dficult for them to process what happened.Chloes older brother is  and hes doing very poorly. One of the first things the family are going to do when they get back is take him to the doctor to seethey can help and get him talking a little bit more.Chloes grandfather - known as Sam - was playing with Chloe when she asked him to lt her up on to a railing so she could bang on the glass, like she does at her older brothers ice hockey games.Tragically he thought there was glass there because it was in a wall of fixed windows - but it was open and she fell on to the concrete below.When askedthe family blame Chloes grandfather for the death, Winkleman said: I dont even knowtheyre necessarily at the point where they are even thinking about blame.I know theyve heard all the reports about him being very careless and holding Chloe out of the window - which he has steadfastly disputed.The focus for them is just getting home and laying Chloe to rest.He added: I think this was a perfect storm of bad things that happened concurrently so generally are these kind of windows dangerous to passengers No not necessarily, but there are laws and codes in the United States that are specically designed to prevent children falling out of windows.Its our early belief that these windows were not compliant with those regulations.Winkleman said the next stage of the investigation was to get hold of the CCTV footage - which he believes will prove the grandfathers version of events - and pin blame on Royal Caribbean for allowing the window to be open without any warning signs or notices.However he claims he has made repeated requests for the footage to Royal Caribbean which has refused to hand it over.Police in Puerto Rico have a copy of a video from the interior of the ship showing the fatal fall - and offered to show it to Chloes parents but the couple were too distraught to view the distressing footage.Instead they asked for a copy - but cops refused.One of the hold ups in our investigation is that Royal Caribbean have not provided us with CCTV footage of the incident which is the most critical piece of evidence, Winkleman explained.At this point theyve outright refused to produce the video.We definitively know there is footage of the incident from the interior of the ship because the police in Puerto Rico wanted to show it to the family but not surprisingly the mom and dad were not willing or ready to watch it at that point.They asked for a copy of it but the police would not give it to them.So for us now the next stage of the investigation is to get hold of the video.Weve repeatedly requested it through Royal Caribbean.If they are not willing to turn it over - it will speed up the timetable of us filing a lawsuit.There is no question that at some point we will get that video because we are absolutely entitled to it.The grandfather and several other family members were so hysterical after the child’s tragic death plunge that they had to be sedated by medics, according to El Vocero.Witnesses told how they heard the family wailing in agony after Chloe fell to her death.Royal Caribbean told the Sun Online they were unable to comment while the matter is under investigation.They said: We are assisting local authorities in San Juan, PR, as they make inquiries after an incident aboard Freedom of the Seas on Sunday.We do not have further information to share at this point."},{"url":null,"title":"family evicted council house takeaway rent kent","story":"Heavily pregnant Lucrezia Worrell, , her partner Daniel Eyers, , and his four young children have been ordered to leave their home in Gillingham, Kent.Daniel, who loves Indian and Chinese meals, said Medway Council officers told his family made themselves intentionally homeless by failing to pay rent.Instead, the couple spent their money on takeaways from JustEat, including a £ meal for his sons birthday.Daniel, who is the father to four children under the age of five, is now homeless with a newborn on the way.The dad of four, who says he cannot get a job because he has to drive his kids to school, admitted he sometimes makes a late rent payment but always pays the money thats owed.He told Kent Online: “We like to treat the children once a week to a takeaway.They don’t usually get much, so it’s a nice treat.“It was my son’s birthday the other month and we spent £ but were told by the council we were spending money on non-essentials rather than paying rent.”Daniel and Lucrezia, who are expecting a baby in less than a month, claim they can spend between £ and £ a week on takeaways.The couple, along with four kids, were living in a three-bedroom £, home in Chatham, Kent  until April when their landlord decided to end the tenancy.Since then, the family were living in emergency accommodation in Gillingham until bailfs turned up at their house on Monday to evict them.The familys takeaway habit was uncovered when Mr Eyres was asked to send over their bank statements.Despite falling behind on rent, the statements showed the family treated themselves to JustEat takeaways weekly.Daniel said: “I’ve been a Medway resident my whole le.

I couldn’t sit up, I couldn’t open my eye, I had to pry it open.”It was then that she demanded her husband take her to the eye hospital.There, Lauren was told by medics that she had ulcers on her eye but docs couldnt say how theyd come to be there.However, samples from her eye later tested positive for Acanthamoeba keratitis - caused by a tiny parasite found in water.The infection is caused by a parasite that is usually found in bodies of water as well as taps, swimming pools, hot tubs, soil and air.Many dferent species of Acanthamoeba exist. Acanthamoeba organisms do not generally cause harm to humans , but they can cause a serious eye diseasethey infect the cornea.Symptoms can include:To avoid Acanthamoeba keratitis, never wear your contact lenses when youre coming into contact with water.Never wash contacts with tap water and never swim, shower or use a hot tub while wearing them.Always clean your contacts in lens solution the moment you take them out, or use daily disposables rather than monthlies.It was at the hospital that Lauren found out that she was pregnant, during what she called a waking nightmare.What should have been one of the happiest moments of her le quickly turned hellish, when docs told Lauren that the strong dosage of eye drops she was taking would probably result in foetal mutation.“I was a mess,” Lauren told Seven News.“The worst part was there were no definite answers.“I would ask ‘what’s going to happen ’ and they would just reply with ‘maybe this or maybe that’.”But, miraculously, Lauren made a complete recovery and was cleared of the parasite in June - six months after her nightmare began.She has no loss of sight and her baby is totally healthy.Docs still dont know what caused the parasite but Lauren admits that she must have gone swimming with her contacts in - although she doesnt remember doing so.“All of the pain and the risk of having permanent eye damage is not worth it,” Lauren said.“The whole experience was pure pain, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.Earlier this week, we reported the tragic story of Nick Humphreys, who has been left partially blind after showering in his contact lenses.Hes now working with the charity Fight for Sight, to raise awareness of the danger of using contact lenses in the shower or while swimming.He said: “I can honestly sayI’d had the slightest idea that this was even a remote possibility I would never have worn contacts in the first place.

chief of staff, has given Meghan a stern warning that something needs to change in the way Team Sussex engages with the taxpaying public.Meghan, , was recently branded a nightmare after her latest Wimbledon visit, where she showed up as a surprise to cheer on pal Serena Williams.An official organising Meghan’s visit admitted it had been dficult, saying to The Times: “It was a nightmare, she was a nightmare.”An All England Club source explained that Meghan had wanted to watch the tennis “incognito, but there were problems.”They said: “They couldn’t invite her into the Royal Box because she was wearing jeans but that didn’t really matter because all she wanted to do was come and watch Serena.And tennis fan Hasan Hasanov, , was warned off as he took a picture from the row in front of Meghan’s VIP seat.But the oil and gas safety engineer was just taking a selfie on his iPhone with the players in the background and was baffled to be asked by a minder: “Please give them privacy.”Jephson wrote in the Daily Mail: Top tip for Sussex courtiers: when my former boss Princess Diana went to Wimbledon privately, she was aware that she was actually attending a prolonged photoshoot.Diana generally never took any staff with her.Compare that with the images weve seen of the Duchess of Sussex with two friends, huddled like survivors in a le-raft, alone on a sea of empty green seats in what has been described as an exclusion zone.Right now it is the Royal advisers to Harry and Meghan who must up their game — or  hand in their fancy racquets on their way out the door.Meghan has recently been fired at by other mums, after pictures of her and baby Archie surfaced at Billingbear Polo Club in Surrey.The -year-old was instantly mum-shamed by cruel Instagram trolls over the way she held baby Archie during his first public outing.Sweet photos emerged of the families watching Prince William and Prince Harry compete, including ones of Meghan kissing and cradling little Archie.But that didn’t stop social media users from being quick to criticise Meghan’s baby carrying methods.A royal source has recently told Sun Online that Meghan is putting possible nannies through an audition process that is humiliating for them.She is said to be struggling to choose a nanny - because she has found it hard to give up control of Archie”.The insider told Fabulous Digital that “it’s like an auditioning process”, and added its been “humiliating for the poor nannies.Despite her recent Wimbledon trip, the Duchess of Sussex is set to join sister-in-law Kate Middleton at

shower in central and northern parts of the country there will be plenty of sunshine and warm temperatures as air comes up from the Azores.We expect the good weather to hold out this weekend and through Monday.Fine weather this weekend will be driven by a huge region of high pressure stretching from the Azores Islands, off the coast of Portugal, to northern Europe, with London and the southeast expected to reap the benefits of the warm winds.But Ms Maxey warned there were signs of a change next week to something more unsettled.She added: High pressure starts to break down and there

The Prime Minister repeatedly refused to admit the country was split over quitting the EU - three years after the UK voted by % to % to leave the bloc. Mrs May is due to walk out of No for the final time on July , handing the keys to either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt. She will leave a deeply ided nation, still torn apart by the  referendum result. But, as she prepares to depart Downing Street having tried and failed three times to get her agreement with Brussels through the Commons, she told the BBC: “I think on the Brexit issue, the public haven’t got that degree of polarisation that exists in Parliament. “I think what we’ve seen in Parliament is not a reflection of the general public.”    She added: “I actually think there’s quite a dference between Parliament and the public. “I think the public have got a very simple view a decision was taken, just get on with it - and they’re not in that same polarised way that Parliament has been about this issue.” It comes despite hundreds of thousands of people marching against Brexit and for a second referendum in recent months. And polls continue to show the country is deeply ided.  A YouGov poll in May found % of peopleaposs first option is to remain in the EU, with % wanting to leave either with no deal , a softer Brexit dealor Theresa Mayaposs deal . Theresa May blamed squabbling MPs, not herself, for the chaotic logjam in Westminster which ultimately triggered her downfall. She attacked “some peoplehave got so sort of entrenched at either end of the argument, that they just weren’t willing to make that compromise that would enable us to get the majority to get this through”.  Second referendum supporters blasted the PM for denying the country was split. Labour MP Phil Wilson MP, of the People’s Vote campaign said: “Theresa May is wrong. “The country is ided and the only way to settle this mess is to give the decision back to the people with a final say confirmatory ballot.” Mrs May was speaking hours after Business Secretary Greg Clark warned a no-deal Brexit could trigger the loss of “many thousands of jobs” . But Mrs May wanted to highlight how she “sacriced” her own job as she tried to force her pact thorough Parliament. “I sacriced my job in order to try to get a deal,” she insisted.  The PM moaned it was “incredibly frustrating” that some MPs who opposed her withdrawal pact have since said they regretted not supporting the agreement. And she also complained about her “Maybot” image, where she was mocked for repeating slogans and being too buttoned-up. “I don’t recognise myself in some of the descriptions that people give of me,” she said. “Nobody likes to have descriptions of them that they don’t think are right but that’s what happens in politics. “It doesn’t only happen to Prime Ministers. “Throughout a political le you have to be prepared for the fact that people will portray you in ways that you might not agree with.” Tomorrow marks Mrs May’s third anniversary in No. But instead of celebrating, she is getting ready to pack her bags to depart for the final time in  days. While she will feel “a mixture of pride at having done the job”, there will also be “a degree of disappointment because there was more that I wanted to do”, she revealed.

They had left a property in Chatham, Kent, in April after receiving a section  notice, meaning their landlord wanted to end the tenancy, in June . They were then in emergency accommodation in Gillingham, Kent, but were recently told by the council their case for housing in Medway was being reviewed. Daniel and his partner had to send over their bank statements where the takeaway app payments were uncovered, and have since been asked to leave the temporary council accommodation. He said heaposs been offered a house in Tyne and Wear,by the early help team, but wants to stay in Medway.

You canapost trust parents to be sensible, none of us our sensible parents, weaposve all given in.    Iaposm sick of this Americanization. We can stop the prom, we can stop the baby shower.

Sarah Mennell, , has hit back after being trolled by cruel strangers for naming her son and daughter Tiamarie and Jackdaniel. But she said she and her children arenapost bothered by the name mocking and are used to any negativity. The mum-of-five, from Hull, said she chose them because people “can’t all have boring names”. There are poignant reasons behind each of her five childrenaposs names, including the names of her other kids, Sydneyrae, Princess and Albert, reports Hull Live. But despite two of the names sounding like alcoholic spirits, Sarah said the children are NOT in fact named after drinks.  She said Jackdaniel, , is named after a Canadian runner and Tiamarie, , is named after a Spanish waitress. The mumaposs unusual choice of names for her children came to light after she made headlines for revealing she spends £ on each of their unorms.  Sarah, who runs Hull Party Services alongside husband Steve, said: We didn’t just pluck them out of thin air one night after a drink. No alcohol or drinks are behind the kidsapos names. We didn’t drink until around five months ago, when we decided to start having one night out as a married couple a month, so we are definitely not alcoholics.  We are just a hard working family who literally like a twist in names, nothing special about it and not alcohol related. But it’s surprising how quick people are to judge. But now we just laugh it off and run with it. It’s quite the conversation starter when were out and about usually, but it’s actually surprising how many boys are called Jackdaniel in some way or another and we know quite a few Tiamaries now. Sarah said Tiamarie was named after the couple, who have been married for  years, had their first family holiday together. She said: Tiamarie was actually decided on our first family holiday as a waitress was called Tiamarie in Spain. It was Spanish and my husbandaposs parents Caroline and Albert used to go quite a lot so we decided on Tiamarie.  We didnapost know at first, as Tia Maria is the drink, not Tiamarie, we just thought it’s dferent, not the normal names flying around everywhere, but the names stuck and we werenapost going to change it to please others. Discussing the reasoning behind calling her son Jackdaniel, she said: Jackdaniel is named after an athlete. When we were having Jack I don’t know I was pregnant. I went into hospital bleeding and it didn’t look good, he was a fighter and even though I was bleeding his legs was kicking like mad on the scan, so he got his name from the great running coach Jackdaniel because he survived this and is here today.    We thought it was funny because the team would put apospowered by Jackdanielapos on their backs. Jackdaniel knows this and always has. And funnily enough he is a runner and recently did the Humber Half Marathon for his rugby team. Some critics said their children would never be taken seriously when they were older, in job interviews for example, due to their names. Sarah hit back and said: Iaposm not worried how his name would appear to others, he gets Jak, Jack, JD, but when meeting new people he addresses them with his full name, Jackdaniel.  No one forgets their names easily and the kids have middle names double barrelled so it’s up to them what name they would like to be called. On paperwork or applications when he is older, he would simply use Mr JD Thomas Mennell. Tiamarie Louise can be used as Tia or Marie or Louise, it’s her choice, her close friends call her Tia. The amount of unusual names used now it’s nothing new, it’s just times are changing and so are names. Tiamarie is actually doing really well at school,  per cent attendance and comes home with awards every week. She is attending the prestigious awards ceremony at Hull City Hall next week as she has been nominated for an award and her grades have improved, she has been moved up in classes, all with help from Kingswood.  The couple also have two younger daughters, Sydneyrae, , who was also named after a young footballer - Sydney Rae Dwyer, and Princess, six. Sarah added: Princess was named Princess because we liked the name. It just stuck during pregnancy because we used to watch Little Princess on Channel  with the younger children at the time. My husband would sing it all the time and my baby would kick at the theme tune when it was on so Princess was born. Also Princess was born in a full amniotic sac so was very special and rare which we joked about, saying apostypical Princessapos.  Originally she was going to be called Bella, but we joked about her being a little princess so that name stuck, Princess Bella-vie vie which means aposachieve something.apos The coupleaposs youngest child Albert, four, is named after his late grandfather. Sarah continued: Albert Henry is named after his grandfather who passed away before he was born and didn’t get to see him. He died of cancer after an  year battle. Albert actually told me I was pregnant and we joked and saidit’s a boy we would call him after him so, in memory of him, he was called Albert Henry like his grandfather and his great grandfather so that family name was always kept.  Albert is a jack the lad, his name suits him and he is so pleasant, he gets told he looks like an Albert all the time. Despite the recent ridicule, Sarah said she would never want to change their names. She also said her and her family have not let the cruel comments online bother them. Our family motto is be kind to others, don’t judge and entertain and make people smile and we know while people are laughing and commenting on the names, butpeople met and actually know them, the names really suit them, she said. If I could turn back time and change the names I wouldn’t.    Some people online couldnapost help but comment on the unusual names after Sarah made headlines for revealing she spends £ on each of their unorms. Soma said: Tiamarie and Jackdaniel  Are you serious !! We rescued a dog called JD and changed it as we thought it was naff. Poor kids. Another wrote: Mummy should have invested in better names. WkdBlue, RedStripe and AppleSourz have future CEO written all over them *eyeroll* Luke Dunn said: “Their dad Johnny Walker works long hours. He also Fosters two kids called Stella and Glen Fiddich. Lovely family”.  Sarah spoke out earlier this week following a campaign to reduce the cost of unorms to make it poverty proof. Tiamarie joined Kingswood Academy in Hull last year and her eldest son, Jackdaniel, joins this September. Having purchased their full branded unorms, including PE kits, the mum has spent more than £ each. Sarah said: I personally think the price is reasonable. The full Kingswood unorm with rugby tops, shorts, tracksuit, rugby socks, ties and all shoes are around £ in total. It’s an investment in their education. If the kids feel smart and look smart it really helps them and it helps them fit in. The unorm campaign has gained support from parents who urge schools to cut the cost of unorm by removing the requirement to use branded, more expensive items.

The south east coast is bracing for lashing winds and flooding from the system, which is currently circulating in the Gulf of Mexico. The US National Hurricane Centeris warning the storm could strengthen into a hurricane by Friday night or early Saturday as it approaches the coast of Louisiana. The storm is packing maximum sustained winds of  miles per hour , the NHC said. But authorities are warning it is the rain that could pack the worst punch as they warn what is looking set to be the first Atlantic hurricane of the year could bring le-threatening floods to New Orleans.      By early Friday the storm was centred  milessouthwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  The NHC is warning of winds of at least  mphby the time it comes ashore late Friday or early Saturday, but officials warned that torrential rains posed the greatest danger. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for Louisiana late Thursday, hours after the regionaposs oil production was cut in half as energy companies evacuated offshore drilling facilities and a coastal refinery.    Authorities are keeping a close eye on the levee system built to contain flooding along the lower Mississippi River that winds through the heart of New Orleans and has been running above flood stage for the past six months. Barry is forecast to bring a coastal storm surge into the mouth of the river that could push its crest to  feeton Saturday. That would be a foot lower than initially predicted but still the highest since  - and dangerously close to the top of the cityaposs levees. Meteorologists predicted as much as  inchesof rain could fall, leading to le-threatening flooding along parts of the Gulf Coast on Friday and Saturday.    The brunt of the storm was expected to skirt the western edge of New Orleans, avoiding a direct hit. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said the city has not ordered any voluntary or mandatory evacuations. But she added that  hours of heavy downpours could overwhelm pumps designed to purge streets and storm drains of excess water in the low-lying city.There is no system in the world that can handle that amount of rainfall in such a short period, Cantrell said on Twitter .Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards warned: The more information we get, the more concerned we are that this is going to be an extreme rain event.    Officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which maintains the levees, insisted that no signicant breaching of the -foot-tall levees in New Orleans was likely. But some residents, recalling the deadly, devastating floods unleashed by Hurricane Katrina in , said they were determined to get out of harmaposs way. Others flocked to supermarkets for bottled water, ice, snacks and beer, thronging grocery stores in such numbers that some ran out of shopping carts.

But the placid giants do not even look up as they graze contentedly here in the Kenyan highlands. Encased in a thick silvery hide that shimmers like armour in the sunlight, Najin, , and her daughter Fatu, , are blissfully unaware of the heavy burden they bear as the only survivors of a sub-species brought to the brink of extinction by human beings. Soon, leading veterinary scientists will visit them at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in the hope of carrying out an extraordinary IVF operation. If it is successful, northern white rhinos, which once roamed Uganda, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, should be saved.    These gentle herbivores symbolise a tragedy caused by human greed and corruption. A breakthrough at Chorzow Zoo in Poland last month brought the possibility that the process that has helped many human couples to conceive might also save the northern white. Scientists from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildle Research in Berlin revealed they had successfully transferred a test tube rhino embryo back into a female whose eggs were fertilised in vitro. They implanted an embryo, fertilised by sperm from a male southern white rhino from a zoo in Austria, into the womb of Hope, an -year-old female southern white.    If Hope’s pregnancy reaches a full term -  months for a rhino - the team intend to repeat the process with eggs harvested from Najin and Fatu. The eggs will be fertilised with sperm taken from one of the last north white rhinos here at Ol Pejeta, four hours north of Kenya’s capital Nairobi. As neither Najin or Fatu can bear children, the embryos will be implanted into a southern white surrogate mother. Although the southern and northern whites are closely related, there are crucial genetic dferences. Southern white numbers have stabilised in the wild. “This is the last chance to save the northern white,” says keeper Zacharia Mutai, who has been at Ol Pejeta for  years. “There are a lot of challenges but it has worked before with a Sumatran rhinoceros at a zoo in Miami.  “Now with only the two northern whites remaining the situation is very serious so we have to try everything. “If it works. the southern white surrogate will give birth to a pure northern white, so all of this effort will have been worthwhile.” Professor Thomas Hildebrandt, leading the IVF team in Europe, said: “The early signs are promising.” The prospect of saving the northern white against vast odds means Najin and Fatu are monitored like no other animals on earth. They are watched around the clock by armed guards stationed in watchtowers looking over the enclosure on the Laikipia plains. Devastated by poaching in some of Africa’s most conflict-riven nations, there have been no sightings of this rhino in the wild since . Poachers reduced northern white numbers from  to  in the s and s.  Najin and Fatu were born in a zoo in Europe, but they, along with two males, were brought to Ol Pejeta when it became clear there were no more of them in their natural habitat. Until very recently, there were faint hopes that a last remaining male, named Sudan, might mate with Fatu. Sadly, the match never happened, and all hopes were extinguished when Sudan died in March last year. Najin and Fatu snort as they pad slowly around their huge enclosure. When their appetite is sated they doze in the dust, rubbing themselves in the dirt to keep cool. They are accompanied by a southern white, introduced to them so they could re-learn how to behave as wild rhinos do. They have  acres to roam, in a protected area full of elephants, zebra and giraffes. Zacharia tells me I can stroke the animals while they eat. I’m wary at first, but neither animal even flinches from human touch.  “From am until pm they are resting,” Zacharia explains. “They are very calm. They only charge when they feel nervous.” It is precisely because of the rhinos’ peaceful nature that cruel humans have been able to take advantage. A short drive from the northern whites’ enclosure are memorials to rhinos killed by poachers. Their horns are sold to buyers in the Far East. The plaques on stone cairns tell of animals being shot by poisoned arrows at night so their horns, made of keratin, the same substance as human fingernails, can be hacked off. One plaque dedicated to a female black rhino named Ishrini says: “Killed by poisoned arrows. The security team found her writhing in pain with the horns already chopped off. She was  months pregnant.” Last year the Daily Mirror accompanied the World Wildle Fund on a rhino translocation in Kenya intended to re-stock an area where the population had been slashed. Tragically the rhinos were accidentally poisoned by salty water from a new borehole. The distressing episode proved just how challenging it is for ­conservationists to win the battle against the poachers.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"dunadd drubbing for league leaders","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArdnamurchan Women#s Camanachd AssociationDunadd ladies closed in on the top of the table with a thumping win against the league leaders.The Mid Argyll girls travelled to Spean Bridge for the game against undefeated Ardnamurchan but proved too strong for the home team.The game started evenly, but two early goals from top goal scorer Eilidh Cameron settled Dunadd.Against the run of play, however, Ardnamurchan broke away and scored, giving the home team hope and momentarily shaking Dunadd.

The plan is to provide an upgraded changing area for a wide range of users and to see the building adjoining MACPool converted into a welcoming and fully accessible community café with soft-play facilities for younger children and multi-purpose activity spaces.A spokesperson for the MACPool, told the Argyllshire Advertiser that the board of volunteers is working hard to secure the funding needed to make this this ambitious project happen. They had a positive meeting with the National Lottery Community Fund on June  and have been invited to submit a Strategic Plan to request funding. They are also approaching many other funders over the coming months to put together the funding package.One of the things they now need to do is find out who would be interested in working with them to make the most of the proposed new facilities. There will be an opportunity for a forward thinking inidual or local business to manage the community café and multi-purpose rooms to hire for regular activity sessions, for example yoga, tai chi, and pilates, as well as a long-term office space for rent.If you are interested in any of these opportunities or have other ideas about hiring any of the spaces regularly, MACPool would love to hear from you as soon as possible.Contact Mary Stewart at MACPool # mary.stewart@macpool.org.uk or phone   to express your interest."},{"url":null,"title":"people pack tarbert for seafood in the sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert#s annual two-day seafood festival was blessed by lovely weather, encouraging people to come out in their droves.The tempting aroma of seafood dishes wafted over the harbour on Saturday July  while locals and visitors alike browsed a huge iety of stalls from local groups and businesses.Chef Mike Leslie of the Coachman Hotel, Kilsyth, ed to cook up delicious tasters using fresh local seafood and held a Ready, Steady, Cook challenge.Also on offer along the harbour were seafood favourites, including Cullen skink, paella, langoustines and all sorts of other fruits of the sea.TJ Mac provided musical entertainment from the trailer stage, there was street magic to enjoy and the irrepressible Absurdist Pipe Band created good-natured havoc in the smiling crowds.The main event, though, was the crowning of this year#s Tarbert Seafood Festival Queen Nell Jackson MacFarlane, supported by her two princesses Codi MacDougall and Farrah MacCallum.This year#s festival parade was a cracker, featuring colourful costumes and plenty of humour based on the theme of Musicals.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this. So much talent and experience from so many organisations, coupled with truly amazing natural resources that could make such a positive impact on the town ndashwe all want it.Innerleithen Community Council has promised to pass on the complaints raised at the meeting to event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland.But Chairman Marshall Douglas said the community council ldquostrongly supports the Transcend Bike Festival and will continue to work closely with event organisers to ensure the future success of the event."},{"url":null,"title":"cops-ask-help-catch-boy-racers-galashiels","story":"POLICE in Galashiels have called on a local supermarket to help them catch boy racers.For months there have been reports made about young drivers gathering at the Tesco car park.And now officers have asked the firm to take down registration details to help them track down the culprits.PC James Harrison said: ldquoWe are still receiving calls about boy racers in the car park at Tesco on a Saturday night.ldquoIt seemed to get better for a while, but the problem is still there.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though. There are a number of initiatives that the group hope will compliment the ethos of environmental action.bull Innerleithen, Walkerburn and Traquair Rotary Club ndash The Rotary Club has sponsored The Edible Garden which has enabled them to get leaflets, brochures and posters to help promote their bid for the Localities Fund. They have agreed to continue to sponsor the Edible Garden to ensure that it thrives in the future.bull The Allotment ndash The Edible Garden, Innerleithen, will now be working with The Allotment, Innerleithen, who are sponsors. Every Friday afternoon volunteers will take veg fruit leftover to The Allotment where locals can buy the freshly picked, organic produce.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal.

A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too. He told the committee: ldquoIt has been dficult attracting sponsorship and corporate hospitality because of the uncertainty however, this seems to be improving."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-for-11-flats-on-car-park-in-haddington","story":"A decade ago the former Courier building on the corner of Haddingtonrsquos Market Street and Newton Port was bought by East Lothian Housing Association .ELHA converted the Market Street side of the building into its headquarters while the northern part was turned into  flats called The Granary.Now, the seven-space car park immediately adjacent to The Granary ndash used by residents there but also available to the general public ndash could be turned into  flats and associated car parking.A planning application has been lodged with East Lothian Council by developer Whiteadder Limited.If approved, there would be a total of  car parking spaces for the whole site ndash the new and the old flats.According to a design and access statement, which is included with the planning application, the site is ldquocurrently an unattractive car park which detracts from the town centre setting.It goes on: ldquoGiven the sitersquos location within the Haddington Conservation Area it represents an opportunity to redevelop a brownfield site.ldquoThe design of the new building will respect its historic context and character to create a positive contribution to the area.The ground floor would be home to a two-bedroom flat, with the first and second floors containing four two-bedroom properties and a one-bedroom flat.Outside, there would be a total of  car parking spaces, as well as a cycle store for  bicycles.Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had concerns about the plans.She said: ldquoWe did object to that for the simple reason that although they are providing car parking spaces, the existing cars that park there are going to have nowhere to park.ldquoYou are just adding that onto the congestion in the town.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, acknowledged the removal of general parking spaces could prove an issue.He said: ldquoIf the council came up with a solid idea and created a car park before they started going down the line of losing spaces, it would probably take the edge off the negativity surrounding any development, especially in the town centre.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Now its never. A flat no. Forget it. Youll have had your referendum.Both Boris and Hunt made clear at the Perth Hustings that there will be no independence referendum, eventhe SNP win outright in . Thats a sobering message for the independence movement, and for Nicola Sturgeon. She still regards the Section  route to a legally-binding referendum as the only plausible one. That is now road-blocked.There has been a dramatic hardening of rhetoric against Scotland during this campaign. Theresa May came to Stirling to proclaim that Nicola Sturgeon ldquocannot be trusted. That the Scottish government is incapable of negotiating ldquoin good faith. Why, Sturgeon had the temerity to portray the UK governments takeover of powers repatriated from Brussels as a ldquopower grab. You just cant deal with these people, May concluded.We all know what Boris Johnson thinks about Scotland. A nation of ldquofreeloaders. He described Scotland having free care and free tuition as ldquopretty monstrous. Jeremy Hunt has tended to be more emollient, but on Friday his gloves came off too. He condemned the Scottish Government as: ldquothe most bullying, isive, duplicitous, anti-business government Scotland has ever seen.Given that the Scottish National Party dominates the opinion polls, and has more seats in both parliaments than all the Unionist parties put together, this could be taken as an oblique criticism of the Scottish voter. I mean, are Scots so stupid that they dont realise they are being run by bullying charlatans  Its almost asthey cant be trusted to know their best interests, deluded as they are by the hypnotic rhetoric of separatism.This was all rather redolent of how British imperialists, like Churchill, used to talk about nationalist leaders in the old British colonies. They were all wily demagogues, up to no good. Cant trust them as far as you can throw them. The subtext was: the only language they understand is firmness. Just tell them what the score is and let them get on with it.This is very much the line taken in the Dailylast week by the Thatcherite former Scottish Secretary, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. He says that the real threat to the Union comes from ldquogiving in to Nationalists demands. The Tories best bet is to tell them politely but firmly that they can stick their independence up their Great Glen ndash or words to that effect.All this is, of course, exactly what the SNP want to hear. There is nothing better for drumming up support for the Nationalist cause than hearing a phalanx of crusty Tory grandees telling Scotland to like the Union or lump it. Support for independence is creeping up ndash slowly but steadily ndash and is now % in the latest polls, and %Boris Johnson wins.True, demand for an early referendum on Scottish independence is certainly muted. But after Mr Johnson enters Number Ten ndash a racing certainty according to the latest YouGov poll ndash and a no deal Brexit looms, things could move fast. The SNP expect support for Yes, which has been stuck for five years, to jump dramatically. Possibly approaching that % which Nicola Sturgeon allowed the media to speculate back in  was the threshold for calling a repeat referendum.But its going to be messy. There is already disquiet in the party and in the wider Yes movement at the SNP leaders apparent lack of enthusiasm for leading the independence revolution. But after this Tory leadership campaign, she can be in no doubt that there has been a sea-change in attitudes to Scotland from the governing party. No more Mr Nice Guy. Scots will have to learn to love Brexit Britain or take the high road out of the Union.Yet, its a little odd that Scotland should have become such a touchstone issue in the Tory leadership race. There are hardly any Tory members in Scotland, after all, and it is they wholl be doing the voting in the campaign, which is now reaching peak empty promise as the ballot papers go out. But both contenders seem to have chosen to make the Union and Scotlands place in it central to their respective campaigns.They each claim, rather improbably, to have an almost religious attachment to the Union. Its blood-in-my-veins stuff for Hunt. The ldquomost successful Union in history according to Boris Johnson, clearly believing that the United States somehow fails to qualy as a union.Perhaps this relates to something deep in the Conservative psyche: that Great Britain needs to retain its subject nationalities to prove that it is still a going concern. Certainly, the loss of Scotland - taking with it a third of the UK landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all of its nuclear weapons - would be a devastating blow to Brexit Britain. The UKs prestige, already diminished as a result of the three years of chaos and indecision, would take an even greater knock. It could lose its place on the UN Security Council, become an empty chair at G Summits...So, there was a bit of carrot to go along with the stick. Boris Johnson has declared himself ldquoMinister for the Union with the implication that devolution is now as important to the Prime Ministers role as First Lord of the Treasury . He is going to take Scotland well in hand, and ensure that all policies in future are stress tested for compatibility with all four nations.Jeremy Hunt too came bearing gts. Scotland is to become a ldquogreen Silicon Valley, a post-Brexit digital entrepocirct. He presumably avoided saying ldquoSilicon Glen because that would have reminded Scottish voters of what happened the last time Scotlands future was predicated on new technology, back in the days when the Tory George Younger ran the Scottish Office.At its height, in the early s, Scotlands technology industry made one third of all the computers manufactured in Europe. Not any more. They went where as the UK de-industrialised under Margaret Thatcher. Mr Hunt also hyped his proposal to slash corporation tax to .% - something Alex Salmond used to argue for. However, this is a policy for the UK as a whole, not Scotland, so there is no obvious comparative advantage, still less any promised to devolve business taxes.But the headline message from both Tory candidates in the Perth hustings was withering contempt for the independence movement. This will no doubt please Conservative members in the southern shires, who have already largely given up on Scotland and regard the Union with pointed indference. As YouGov discovered recently, the vast majority would willingly let Scotland goit meant saving Brexit.They may get their way sooner than they think."},{"url":null,"title":"feel-like-meet-elvis","story":"Itrsquos an enduring memory and something Irsquoll never forget.

The DWP argues sanctions are only used as a last resort.Mr Doris said: ldquoWe are deeply concerned that despite raising this issue as part of the Committeersquos In-Work Poverty Inquiry with the DWP in January, and the UK Governmentrsquos failure to appear at our Committee to give evidence, they have carried on with plans for implementation regardless.ldquoThis movement represents a huge cultural sht and we do not believe it is right to sanction the working poor, effectively punishing people for going to their work.ldquoThe DWP has said they are currently taking a lsquolight touchrsquo approach to in-work conditionality or sanctions but there is little confidence that when the system rolls out more widely that low paid and part-time workers wonrsquot suffer as a result.ldquoThe roll-out of Universal Credit has been littered with mistakes and it is vital that this latest pilot is put on hold to ensure that there is no negative impact upon claimants who rely on this money.The Social Security Committee said the transfer of claimants to Universal Credit should not proceed until there is more clarity around what it will mean for those affected. It also stated it is opposed in principle to attaching punitive conditions to those already in work.:MSPs blame soaring rent arrears on Universal CreditLast week, a food bank in Harrogate warned it is braced for a rise in demand as a result of the pilot, which will see long-term benefits claimants shted to the new system for the first time.Claimants usually have to wait up to five weeks for their first payment under Universal Credit, but this has been reduced to two and a half weeks for the Harrogate roll-out.Critics have blamed this delay for pushing people into poverty and debt.Lucy Stewart of the Harrogate food bank told the BBC it fed more than , people last year.She said: ldquoWe hope the process goes smoothly but the reality is that there will always be people who slip through the net of this pilot.ldquoWersquore likely to see an increase in demand for food, because people moving across to the new system are going to spend three weeks without any income.The DWP said there are now more than two million claimants receiving Universal Credit and service improvements continue to be introduced.It said the Harrogate pilot will begin this month and last for at least a year, and will be subject to ldquofull and rigorous internal governance.In addition, the DWP said it has committed toto the Commons with its findings before making wider changes.It said there are no immediate plans to expand the latest pilot into Scotland.A spokesman said: ldquoWe are taking a measured approach to moving people to Universal Credit from the old system, working with expert stakeholders to

The story attracted headlines, and Pan Am, knowing good publicity when it saw it, launched its First Moon Flights Club. Official cards were issued to members.Pan Ams futuristic space plane Orion III, seen in the  sci-fi classic film, : A Space Odyssey, seemed to bring the prospect of commercial Moon flights ever closer. On July , two days after man walked on the Moon, it was reported that some , people, including  Scots, had asked Pan Am and Trans World airlines to book them seats on the first commercial Moon flights.Pan Am had informed applicants that it had no idea of the cost or other relevant details. \"We have always treated the inquiries seriously because there is no telling what will happen, said a spokesman.

Apollo  launched from Cape Kennedy on July , and when, four days later, Armstrong stepped from the Eagle lunar module with the words \"...one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,\" some  million television viewers were giddy with excitement. The sense of wonder ndash that humanity had actually walked on a distant celestial body ndash was nothing short of profound.Herald reader Russell Smith relates: \"Along with the death of King George V when school lessons were stopped in the afternoon for the news, Suez, Bannisterrsquos sub- minute mile, and the assassination of President Kennedy, those of my generation , will never forget the amazement at the technological development of the  Moon landing, the pictures, commentary, and the successful . My elder daughterjust remembers being told, Yoursquore going to see something amazing, the man on the Moon.\"Mr Smith has two interesting souvenirs of that epic time ndash a Man on the Moon dish-towel, and a special presentation pack, Touchdown on the Moon, which included everything from Apollo s flight plan to press briefings, lunar excursion orders and even a  record, Man on the Moon, which includes voices of the NASA announcer and the astronauts.\"It was July  and the words, This is one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind, were about to become part of modern history,\" begins Moira Strachans contribution to Scottish Book Trustrsquos Stories of Home campaign . \"Whenever I hear those words now I am transported back to that time when, strangely perhaps, I shared my home in Greenock with a number of American sailors. No round-the-clock news coverage then: only the print headlines, the radio and the  orsquoclock news, but the air was ringing with the sounds of whooping and hollering as they celebrated, loudly and patriotically, Neil Armstrongrsquos achievement of being the first man to step on the moon.\"Strachan, who is now retired, was  then: home was the Inverclyde Sailorsrsquo Centre on Dalrymple Street, where her father was the manager. Around  Americans lived there while their Holy Loch base across the Clyde was being refurbished.\"The excitement of the Moon landing stretched over several days,\" recalls Herald reader Gordon Casely. \"I worked for Evening Express in Aberdeen and ndash unusually for an evening paper ndash news of the moonshot and subsequent landing appeared on Page  across all of our editions. I happened to be at home during the actual landing, listening to live coverage on the radio, and well recall Neil Armstrongrsquos words crackling over my bonnie big multi-valve radio. So thrilled was I that I phoned my parents in Edinburgh, and held the phone to the radio so that they could hear voices all the way from space.\"For us on the paper,\" he adds, \"the Moon landing had all hands to the plough. When news broke early one afternoon that the astronauts were having dficulty sleeping in their capsule, editor Bob Smith re-plated Page  halfway through the final edition print-run. Thus the paper landing on the streets for the five orsquoclock homeward rush bore the single heading MOONSOMNIA!\"In the early hours of the st, the Glasgow Herald had acute problems with deadlines for its first edition. In his history of the paper, Alastair Phillips says everything was in place, including a banner headline, Man lands on the Moon. The start-button just needed to be pressed that would get the presses rolling. But Armstrong, writes Phillips, was being unconscionably slow about coming down the ladder. Until he set foot on the Moon, the chief sub-editor had the incongruously attentive but far-away look of the man who was mulling over the possibility of a more depressing headline and opening paragraph.Herald View: Apollo  Moon Landing was humankinds greatest breakthrough, but our next must be closer to homeThe machine-room manager warned the editor, Alastair Warren, that he could only give him another five minutes, otherwise the edition would not go out in time and would miss distribution vans. Armstrong remained poised on the ladder, six feet above the surface. The Herald staff were getting desperate. Phillips himself said the presses should roll, but not a single copy must leave the place until you get the all-clear from this phone. The presses were picking up speed when Armstrong stepped off the ladder.The updated headline for the second edition read, MAN WALKS ON THE MOON: Astronauts go exploring after perfect landing in Sea of Tranquillity, alongside an artists impression of Armstrong on the lunar surface.\"A new age dawned at .am yesterday morning when Neil Armstrong stepped on to the Moon,\" began the Herald leader on July . \"Historians may judge that modern times have ended, and the space age has begun.\"ldquoI was  when the first manned Moon landing took place,\" says the Rt Rev Colin Sinclair, the current Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. \"I remember being allowed to stay up very late to watch it happen.ldquoIt was nearly am before Neil Armstrong put his foot on the surface of the Moon. I was very tired but it was all very exciting. His well-known words, \"one small step for man, one giant step for mankind\" were actually quite dficult to hear and their impact only came later when they were repeated the following morning on the news.ldquoAt the time you felt that human beings could do anything they set their minds to. We thought that was the beginning of the exploration of the planets. Sadly, three years later, the whole project would stop.This memory, from Basia Palka from Poznan, Poland, comes courtesy of the Glasgow Science Centre, which is staging several special events to mark the th anniversary. \"I arrived in Scotland in  after being put on a train in Poznan aged  by my grandfather. I travelled to the UK by myself and was met at Harwich by my mum whom I had not seen for two years. I was brought to a single end in the Gorbals.\"We had a black-and-white TV and on the day of the Moon landing some of the neighbours piled in to the one room to watch this bit of history in the making. At that point in time I had no English but I understood that this was an amazing moment.\"I was in empathy with the astronauts who had taken such a trip as I felt that I, too, had taken an enormous journey to get here to Glasgow all by myself with a name tag round my neck, not unlike Paddington Bear.\"I remember it well when I had put my foot down on British soil for the first time as I watched the first astronaut putting his foot down on the surface of the moon.We had this much in common we had taken a ginormous journey.Theirs had been a bit longer than mine.\"Dr Alistair Ramsay MBE remembers: \"I was a student working as a silver-service waiter in the Atholl Palace Hotel in Pitlochry. \"Normally the waiters ate their meals in one part of the hotel but the lsquobluersquo staffhad their own dining room and they got chips. Waiters normally werenrsquot allowed into the blue staff dining room but I had started in the hotel as a kitchen porter before being promoted to the dining room, so I was allowed in. On the day of the Moon landing I went to the blue staff dining room and watched \"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" while stuffing my face with chips. A big argument was raging about whether or not it was a massive con but watching on a black and white TV it was still very impressive!\"Scots-born former airline pilot Bill Innes, author of Flight from the Croft, remembers: \"Like all pilots I was fascinated by the Moon landing and watched as much as I could on the ghostly telly pictures of the time. It is absolutely amazing what was achieved with the primitive computers of those days. Eight years later I had the privilege of watching aDelta rocket launch a satellite from Cape Canaveral and that was impressive enough. The Americans had every right to have their breasts swell with patriotic pride.\"He added: \"Even in  when the first glass cockpit Bs and s appeared, their computer power was a fraction of that of a modern smartphone. The only advantage my job gave me was that a darkened cockpit is a great place to catch satellites and space stations tracking across the night sky.\"Another Herald reader, Sandy, from Stirling, who is in his eighties, says: \"I remember sitting in the lounge of the old Golf Hotel in Elie, watching a small television screen with all the other guests and my we and little daughter around midnight that day. My we was pregnant with our son and at that time she had thoughts about calling him Neil.\"In the event, they went with another name, but some couples were sufficiently inspired by the Moon landing to christen a new-born after one of the astronauts, among them a couple in Monieth, who named their son after all three. A couple in Toledo, Ohio, christened their new baby boy Neil Armstrong. Their surname  Moon.It is fair to say, however, that not everyone was overwhelmed by what happened in July . Herald reader Thelma Edwards remembers that she shunned the entire event: \"I refused offers from family members to view the whole thing on their TV sets. This was all due to what had happened to Laika, the dog that Russia sent into space in . She died very soon after the launch and I was steaming mad. What right had we to use animals for these purposes  Perhapswhat happened to Laika, and several other animals, hadnrsquot happened I might have felt dferently about the whole thing. We have made a mess of this planet so we should stay on it and put it right, not go spreading our mess on other planets.

Six South Africans paid pound each to travel to London to watch the broadcasts. Crime in Italy during the night dropped to one-third of its normal levels. ITVs Man on the Moon programme, a seven-hour-long special fronted by David Frost, included entertainment spots from, amongst others, Lulu and Engelbert Humperdinck.

Of the , just four are alive: Aldrin, Scott, Duke and Schmitt. But public and political fascination with deep-space exploration quickly faded.As The Herald noted on the th anniversary of Apollo , the topic suffered a \"drastic loss of interest and funds after , because it was then only a propaganda extravaganza with very limited practical benefits.\" Priorities suddenly, decisively, lay where: inflation, urban riots, the closing stages of the Vietnam war, the Middle East war, oil prices, Watergate.Herald View: Apollo  Moon Landing was humankinds greatest breakthrough, but our next must be closer to homeIn recent months, however, interest has been revived in the Moon.

Alcohol is strange. Often, its usage is related to stress and depression, both of which run rampant in the Mummy of Parliaments.But which man or woman of the world can deny that, after a rotten day, a large GT or dram can work wonders, settling down the mind and making one feel human again  Having been bossed around and bullied all day, the relaxed imbiber sticks his or her head out the window and shouts: ldquoYou can all go and procreate yourselves!Marvellous. The medical profession has nothing to equal this wonder drug. Indeed,you could bottle it, yoursquod be on to a fortune.Alcohol can also supply confidence and Dutch courage, which can come in handy where someone has to do something heroic like make a speech in a place full of rude, shouty people. Butever the expression ldquotoo much of a good thing made any sense itrsquos in relation to alcohol. With alcohol, everything quickly becomes all right and slowly becomes all wrong.The dficulty with drink is that one or two make you a god or sage, without the power or wisdom to know thatrsquos the point at which you should stop. The arithmetic of alcohol is that one or two leads to three or four.That mid-point where you should stop just as yoursquore starting to feel unnaturally happy is the most dficult thing for the human mind to master. Itrsquos like kung fu: the whole secret of which is to stay calm in the middle of a violent confrontation, which no one in the world can do ndash only a master .All that said, Irsquom not convinced alcohol is the sole reason for bullying at Westminster. It occurs in many other workplaces that donrsquot have several bars on the premises. Perhaps itrsquos to do with the sort of person who becomes an MP, someone who seeks power, the direction to which only becomes evident when one throws away onersquos moral compass.Irsquove never understood, or approved of, the arrogance behind any public speaking: the idea that everyone should listen to you. If you know anyone like this, Irsquod advise cutting all ties with them immediately.And yet itrsquos what politicians are all about. Itrsquos about people drunk on their own ego. I guess itrsquos true that drink makes this worse but, again, I wonderitrsquos the root cause of all the bad behaviour Doon There.In an odd, inverse way, todayrsquos widespread, prurient and hypocritical horror of drink only makes it more attractive. Thatrsquos human nature. In more sensible countries than ours, itrsquos acceptable to have a little pick-me-up at any time of the day.People who look back to the Seventies with fondness always single out the fact that it was quite common for people to go for a pint at lunchtime. The late Queen Mother liked a wee swallie as soon as the clock struck noon, and no evidence ever emerged of her getting into a fist-fight or walking around the palace with her pants on her heid.But perhaps, today, rather than having a civilised snter at periodic intervals, therersquos too much bingeing. It might be possible to have alarms go off whenever an MP demands that third killer drink. Or perhaps they could be fitted with smart watches that zap them electronically when they go over the score I dare say not. Besides, I still suspect itrsquos their personalities that require a sense of moderation.++++WE live, as you know, in times where abuse of Scotland from south of the border is as rampant as a lion, but even mentioning the ldquoE word up here is likely to lead to imprisonment.

They participated in the hijacking of a bill to keep Northern Ireland running in the absence of devolved government by using it to liberalise abortion law there and to legalise same-sex marriage. This was a coup carried out by the UKrsquos metropolitan elite and the SNPrsquos role in it was hypocritical and shameful.Nationalist MPs have always chosen never to vote on devolved matters affecting other parts of the UK, being aware that to do so undermines its opposition to any erosion of Holyroodrsquos devolved powers. Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNPrsquos Westminster group, airily waved away such pfling concerns. He said that the current uncertainty in Northern Ireland politics permitted his MPs to vote on amendments to the proposed bill. It will pass into lawNorthern Irelandrsquos main parties canrsquot restore power-sharing by October .:Holyrood could do with a few more mavericksLetrsquos talk frankly here. None of this stemmed from any authentic concern for the future of politics in Northern Ireland. If the amendments had been about any other issue the SNP would have stuck to what remains of its moral principles and kept their distance. Indeed,this had been about putting in place special measures to combat the effects of a No-Deal Brexit in Northern Ireland, you might even make a case for the SNP using the lsquospecial circumstancesrsquo justication to vote on them. This though, was about something more sinister. It was about imposing a social and cultural diktat on a country which has always rejected the secularist and anti-Christian orthodoxy which fuels the political agenda in Scotland. The SNP chose to wait until Scotlandrsquos neighbour was at its weakest and in need of genuine assistance to insult and humiliate them.In any other constituent part of the UK there would have been an outcrylegislators from outwith their jurisdiction had sought to drive through changes in these sensitive areas without any consultation. There was no prior discussion with any of Northern Irelandrsquos elected representatives and no notice that such changes were being mooted. Instead they chose to treat this country with utter contempt and accord it the serf status that the British Empire once reserved for its minion states. The SNP, self-proclaimed s of enlightened, inclusive and progressive politics, were part of this.They must have known that  per cent of people in Northern Ireland, according to a recent ComRes poll, are opposed to the UK making a legislative intervention such as this. The Lib-Dem peer, Lord David Alton, speaking in the Lords this week, said: ldquoWe have always treated Northern Ireland not as having to be in unormity but as being dferent and having dferent cultural values. The law on abortion in Northern Ireland, with its distinct traditions and identity, is something about which many people in Northern Ireland hold a very dferent view from the views of the English metropolitan classes.These classes also exist in Scotland and drive the Holyrood agenda. Part of this is conducting a well-organised and well-funded campaign of legal harassment against those who profess authentic Christianity and not the platitudinous and fey facsimile of it that our Government would like it to be. Thus, anyone who holds the belief that an unborn child is the most vulnerable member of the human race and has an equal right to le as all other humans is dismissed as extremist and sexist. Those who believe that the sacrament of marriage is reserved for a man and a woman are hounded by the SNPrsquos social media jackals and accused of homophobia. Each is a chillingly well-constructed and implacably-pursued lie.:Boris Johnsons tax plans could spell disasterMany Christians were among those who voted for Scotland to be an independent country. We donrsquot believe that Scotland has a higher set of values than England or even that the country necessarily will be better governed or be economically better off. We just believe that independence is Scotlandrsquos natural state itrsquos what God intended this country to be,itrsquos still permissible to deploy a ine lexicon in modern Scotland. The SNP though seems bent on harrying many of its supporters to a place where they are forced to choose between the party and their faith. For many, the Christian faith is the bedrock of their political beliefs. In a secular society we recognise the primacy of the state but we expect the state into let us practise our faith without retribution.Instead, we are seeing the emergence of a hostile environment for Christians where midwives are disciplined for refusing to carry out abortions social workers likewise for refusing to place children with same-sex couples and church members are barred from sitting on local authority bodies. In the background is the constant drumbeat of attacks on Catholic schools. Diversity  Inclusiveness  There are many in the SNP who are strangers to these concepts when they apply to Scotlandrsquos Christian community.Kevin McKenna: Whatever happened to Ruth Davidsons Tory revival There are also profound political consequences flowing from the SNPrsquos hypocrisy and cowardice in its Northern Ireland power grab. This will haunt them in any future referendum. It suggests that its leadership is more concerned with imposing its militant social ideology on Scotland than with making it independent. Itrsquos currently seeking to persuade un-decided voters about the advantages that come with independence even as it stamps all over the independence of its neighbours. In doing so they have just provided a gt to Unionists and betrayed the wider Yes movement."},{"url":null,"title":"lewis-capaldi-vs-noel-gallagher","story":"Itrsquos not the first time the pair have clashed with Gallagher calling Capaldirsquos music ldquof*****g w***k in a radio interview in June before the cheeky Scot entertained his fans ndash and won many more ndash by swaggering onto Glastonburyrsquos Other Stage wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the older Gallagher brotherrsquos face.Lewis, who Lewis Capaldi was born in Glasgow and brought up in Whitburn, West Lothian.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmOrkney end the NatWest International Island Games on seven medals after securing a gold and a silver on the final day.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will disrupt flights at the busiest time of the year.“It is the ongoing work to rule, however, that is causing most problems for travellers. The disruption is unpredictable and dficult to avoid. Last week, for example, the refusal to agree an extension to the opening hours at Kirkwall airport saw passengers stranded in Aberdeen, including patients and a mother ing with her new-born baby.“It underlines the impact this industrial action is having and who is paying the price.

It is disheartening to have received a counter-offer from Prospect that is beyond our affordability.“Over the past eight months, we have discussed ious options with the union and have been clear throughout that any proposal must be affordable and within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. Prospect are aware of HIAL’s budgetary restrictions and our latest offer constituted compromise to accommodate trade union demands within the bounds of the pay policy.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute and our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five-year period remains on the table.

But that may be about to change.The Flow Country in Caithness and Sutherland is around , square miles of m deep peat and boggy pools that has been growing since the end of the last Ice Age more than , years ago.If a bid under way is successful, it could become the UK’s rd World Heritage Site, joining the likes of Edinburgh’s Old and New Towns, the Forth Bridge, Stonehenge and the Lake District.It was first named on the “tentative list” of UK World Heritage Sites in , but has so far been overlooked, with the Government instead putting forward others for consideration by Unesco. The team behind the Flow Country’s latest bid believe its long wait for recognition will soon come to an end, partly due to its timing coinciding with calls for radical action on climate change.Widely considered to be the largest area of blanket bog in the world, it is capable of storing m tonnes of carbon dioxide – more than every tree in the UK put together.Deep peatlands are the perfect natural ally in the fight against climate change as they slow down the carbon breakdown process, stopping it from being released into the atmosphere.The same factors – high acidity and a lack of oxygen – also explains the phenomenon of “bog people”, well preserved human cadavers found in similar bogs thousands of years after their deaths.“There’s a consensus that this is the best peatland of its type anywhere in the world,” says Joe Perry, who is co-ordinating the Flow Country bid. “There’s nothing to compare with it. We consider it the Amazon of peatlands or the Great Barrier Reef of peatlands.” He says the time is ripe for global recognition of the bog in the wake of the UK committing to achieve net zero emissions by .“[Peatlands] are the most effective natural carbon store,” he adds. “It’s just an extraordinarily efficient and effective way of keeping that harmful stuff out of our atmosphere.”The Flow Country is also home to rare birds, including the golden plover, dunlin and curlew, and has fresh water pearl mussels.The bid was ramped up last weekend with a series of local events featuring high profile backers, including archaeologist and television historian Neil Oliver and geologist Professor Iain Stewart.Oliver, who is also president of the National Trust for Scotland, describes the bog as a “mysterious corner of the country” that is “remote even to most Scots”. “I would guessyou were to stop  people on Princes Street in Edinburgh or Buchanan Street in Glasgow and ask them about the Flow Country, the majority would struggle,” he says. Mr Perry adds: “It’s one of the few places you can go to where you can turn  degrees and not see anything built by a human. It’s an incredible place.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why public transport is vital to ensure equality for all michael mcewan","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...For many people, even though public transport plays a big part in their daily lives, they may not give it much thought unless there#s a problem. Butyou have a disability, it can be challenging to find accessible public transport across Scotland, writes Michael McEwan.Aside from my research as a journalist, I’ve first-hand knowledge of this in my role as chair of my local disability group, East Renfrewshire Disability Action . We recently ran a campaign to address the lack of accessible taxis. Once there was just one fully accessible taxi in East Renfrewshire, but after six years of meetings with the council and steering groups to show them the need for more, there are now -plus accessible cabs registered in the area.At national level, an accessible travel framework is in process to ensure people with a disability have the absolute right to live a le of equal opportunities – the ability to travel being an important enabler of those opportunities.This framework has been co-produced by the National Transport Accessibility Steering Group, which includes local government, Transport Scotland and people with a disability. The main purpose is to support disabled people’s rights by removing barriers and improving access to travel. Issues being addressed include getting on and off a bus, train or ferry etc, accessible travel information, getting to transport facilities, staff attitudes and transferring between dferent modes of transport. The group has been working together to gather knowledge, advice and the lived experiences of disabled people, as well as people currently working in the public transport sector.: Scottish Greens call for ‘free public transport across Europe’: We must learn from pasttransport is to succeed in future – John YellowleesThe main focus to ensure co-operation between disabled people and transport sector staff continues, the hope is to effect real change. There have been a number of problems highlighted recently in the UK media, including a young man from Troon who was left stranded on a train miles from home due to the absence of a pre-booked ramp on board and the shocking story of a paraplegic man who had to drag himself through Luton Airport after his self-propelling wheelchair was left behind on a flight. But there are hopeful signs too.Edinburgh-based company Neatebox has designed an app for people with reduced mobility and hidden disabilities to help them get the assistance they need at Edinburgh Airport. The app sends a signal to the airport’s Passengers with Reduced Mobilityreception area to noty staff that the passenger is on their way, to enable them to prepare for their arrival and offer a personal and respectful service. Founded in  by former guide dog mobility instructor, Gavin Neate, Neatebox looks to improve the lives of disabled people through the use of smart technology. Edinburgh also recently became the first airport in Scotland to be recognised as autism friendly.On the rail network, ScotRail has teamed up with Interpreter Now to introduce a new British Sign Languageapp to Scotland’s railways, a first for the UK industry. Interpreter Now is a service that delivers immediate access to online interpreting for BSL users, enabling deaf and hearing people to communicate. Users connect via a video call to an interpreter who can relay the customer’s query to members of staff. The interpreter then signs the answer.While it is encouraging to see the development of disability support network and apps within the public transport system, there is still much work to be done to ensure that people with a disability have the confidence to move freely and safely around the country.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"would you pass this test of honesty jim duffy","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...An #honesty bar# in a boutique hotel in Spain has made Jim Duffy think about the nature of truth.“Honesty is the always best policy” should be the main mantra for the way we live our lives. Whether that be honesty with ourselves, our work colleagues, relationships, companies we deal with online or simply telling our children the truth.It seems this mantra is not what we are getting from some of our politicians, who like to be economical with the truth, albeit for them, they are being honest. But, for the large majority of us, we try our best to live our lives as “honestly” as we can. We pay our bills on time. We do not pinch milk from Sainsbury’s self-service checkout. We do not do a runner from the petrol station.All this came into sharp focus for me this week when I was presented with an honesty bar. The results were a little blurred.I’d come across honesty bars before. Unlike a traditional bar where one would order some drinks then hand over cash or a card, an honesty bar has no-one minding the till. There is no ‘bar’ as such or anyone preventing you from direct access to drink. The gantry and fridge is open for business and you are the sole arbiter of how well the bar does at the end of the night. In short, either you are honest and pay for the drinks you have consumed or you try to shave off a little mixer or dram here or there. The whole honesty bar process and concept tells you a lot about you.: I don’t read novels. Am I normal  – Jim Duffy: Why sometimes it’s okay to telllies to your partner – Jim DuffySo, how did I fair  Checking into a lovely boutique hotel in the Spanish mountains is the stuff dreams are made of – € a night for the most breathtaking views and small well-equipped room that made me feel I was straight out the book, A Year in Provence. Mind you, when I asked our Spanish hoststhey had read it or spent any time in France, the look said it all – non. Everything was perfect for our one-night stay to celebrate my birthday. It was literally picture postcard stuff with a set menu for dinner. Then the owner dropped the bomb on me when he showed us the Honesty Bar.The bar itself was a very swish wooden-built bar with fridges built in. There were large compartments, each with their own specic spirits. The gin compartment housed ten ied bottles of gin. So too the vodka, brandy, rum and, of course my favourite, whisky. There was a multitude of wine ieties, where the bottles themselves were works of art. The fridges contained a plethora of beers from all over he world as well as ice, cut fruit and mixers for the drinks.Everything was as it should be, with elegant glasses for wine and heavy tumblers for that gorgeous dram. There was a little receipt pad located on one of the surfaces with a pen, to record what we had consumed. To record what we had consumed ...  This wonderful bar was like an Aladdin’s Cave of drink and possibility. And it was mine to explore before dinner and, of course, it would still be there afterwards.But, despite feeling elated at full exposure to this candy shop of alcohol, there was something niggling at me – the receipt pad. It wasn’t free and gratis. It was up to me to be honest about what I would take. But, alas, there was no-one there to check. No-one there to monitor my tab. How would I fair and just how honest would I be I poured my partner a gin and tonic. Some strawberry affair with matching tonic. It all looked a bit posh as gin does these days. A simple “Gordons” has been replaced with a whole choir of gins including apple, orange and strawberry. A most competitive marketplace, I mused as my eyes were constantly drawn to the whiskies. I quickly decided on a good old Scottish malt. A Glenlivet with a single cube of ice. Mind you, I free-poured a large one – after all, that is what they do in Spain right  No optics or measures here. And who would check anyway  I duly noted one whisky and one gin on the receipt pad. Job done. Well done, to a extent ...We sat with our drinks and I savoured the moment. I watched as others used the honesty bar, pouring large drinks into tumblers. I watched them also tot up their rounds on their own receipts. Then it was off to dinner.The next morning after breakfast, our host enquired as to what drinks we had taken from the honesty bar  It seemed my rather bland attempt to obfuscate the exact brand of gin and whisky we had taken was not ideal.But, the big question is, did I try to cover up the fact that we had premium brands or was I simply being flippant with the receipt as it was not really going to be checked by HMRC  I took the receipt and re-entered exactly what we had taken by brand. And at that moment, I felt a slight pang of guilt. Why had I not been  per cent honest  Why did I treat the honesty bar with so little respect  As we checked out later, we paid our bill and – of course – our bar bill. Every item on the bar bill was now in ink and it looked very dferent from what I had jotted down the night before. Still feeling a little disheartened as we left, despite paying € for one round of drinks, I did question myself on why I simply did not record my drinks accurately at the honesty bar. Hey ho, I thought, one to ponder.But, it made me think about what “honesty” really means and when presented with choices in le, when honesty is at the fore of decision-making, what measure do we really use to be as honest as we can ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"alasdair gray scottish independence turning out as tory as westminster","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...He is perhaps the best-loved Scottish artist of his generation, a writer so respected that his verse was carved on to the wall of the parliament building at Holyrood.But Alasdair Gray, a long-standing supporter of Scottish independence, appears to be harbouring doubts about the benefits of a second referendum.The Glasgow-based polymath and committed socialist claimed he was “disappointed in the way Scotland has taken” when discussing the current political turmoil gripping the UK. In an interview with the left-leaning Prospect magazine, Gray expressed reservations when the subject of Brexit, and how it could lead to an IndyRef, was raised.“That is what I did hope,” he said. “Unfortunately, the independent Scotland — in so far as Scotland has its independence — is turning out as Tory as Westminster.”Gray has been a vocal contributor to the constitutional debate north of the Border in recent decades.

He stressed his commitment to hiking defence spending to . per cent of GDP – an increase of £ billion – would protect skilled jobs at the likes of Rosyth.The foreign secretary said the ongoing tensions in the Gulf, which will see Britain bolster its military presence in the region next week with the arrival of another warship amid rising tensions with Iran, demonstrated how the Royal Navy has been “run down too much” in recent decades.He has pledged to review Britain’s existing commitment of  destroyers and frigateshe succeeds Theresa May, with plans to look at whether extra Type  frigates of offshore patrol vessels are required. Mr Hunt told The Scotsman that by delivering a “historic funding boost” for the armed forces, it would benefit Scottish industry.He said: “As the son of a naval officer who was based in Rosyth for several years, I would view it as my duty to try and ensure the proud shipbuilding traditions of those docks continued for as long as possible.“Backed by my promise to increase the defence budget to . per cent of GDP, my government would support further shipbuilding in Scotland. He added: “My commitment would seek to protect skilled jobs by delivering more work to dockyards across the UK, including at Rosyth.”It is unclear how any increase in the navy’s complement would impact on shipyards on the Clyde.BAE’s yards in Govan and Scotstoun have a contract to build three Type  frigates. Initial talks are underway between the firm and the Ministry of Defence to construct a further five frigates, which would secure work in the area for the next two decades.Any additional production would likely require an increase in manufacturing capacity. The UK government’s next full-scale Strategic Defence and Security Review is due next year. It comes as Mr Hunt called for “cool heads” to prevail to ensure there was no “unintended escalation” in the Gulf.It was confirmed yesterday that HMS Duncan, a Type  destroyer that is in the Mediterranean, will next week join HMS Montrose – the frigate that drove off Iranian patrol boats attempting to impede the progress of a British tanker. While HMS Montrose will eventually be relieved for maintenance work and crew changes, it is expected the two ships will be present in the region for a spell amid growing concerns over Iranian threats to disrupt shipping in the strategically important waterway.The Ministry of Defence said the move “will ensure that the UK alongside international partners can continue to support freedom of navigation for vessels transiting through this vital shipping lane”.Mr Hunt said: “We have a responsibility to protect British shipping and, with our allies, to protect the waterways and seaways of the world, so we have to react according to the threats that we face.“But this is not an Iran-specic issue – notwithstanding the broader tensions in the region. This is about Syria and about a breach of the sanctions against Syria, which of course is a country that Iran is active in.”Tehran yesterday reiterated calls for the UK to release an Iranian-owned oil tanker that was seized by Royal Marines over suspicions it was violating EU sanctions by transporting a shipment of oil to Syria. But Abbas Mousavi, a spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry, warned Britain was entering into a “dangerous game” that would have “consequences”. Mr Mousavisaid: “The documents and evidence and the contradictory remarks made by the British all indicate that London’s allegation, legally speaking, is not that signicant and noteworthy unless they would want to enter into a dangerous game under the influence of the Americans with no end in sight.”During Friday prayers, Kazem Sedighi, an adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, threatened retribution.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland should get its own distinct immigration rules under new pilot","story":"The Scottish Government has formally proposed #piloting# a distinct system of immigration north of the Border.Holyrood’s immigration minister Ben Macpherson has written to his UK counterpart ahead of a summit on the issue later this month amid growing concerns that Scotland will suffer under a post-Brexit crackdown.In the letter to the Minister of State for Immigration Caroline Nokes, Mr Macpherson said a tailored approach to immigration should be considered.He said: “A declaratory system, avoiding the need to make an application and removing the threat of refusal except in the most extreme circumstances would best protect the rights of EU citizens living here.”The call comes after the Migration Advisory Committeesaid a tailored migration policy for dferent parts of the UK should be taken forward.A four-nations roundtable meeting on migration will see the Holyrood minister and Ms Noakes joined by the Welsh Government’s Brexit minister Jeremy Miles and the head of Northern Ireland’s Civil Service David Sterling.“Given the signicance of the matter to Scotland, I would also like to discuss how we can work together to deliver the regional immigration pilot projects the MAC recommended in their most recent report, which was a welcome acknowledgement of the need for tailored migration policy for dferent parts of the country,” his letter states.Mr Macpherson has also renewed concerns over the proposed salary threshold of £, for EU workers, which he claimed would have a “catastrophic” effect on the economy of Scotland.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message.

If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector.

However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

Mr. Herbinson, a member of the th Royal Irish Rles Association paid tribute at the last resting place of his great uncle Sgt Robert Herbinson who was killed in action on August ,  in the Ypres Salient.Sgt. Herbinson had survived the slaughter of the first day on the Somme where he had performed gallantly under fire and subsequently moved with the remainder of the thDivision to the British sector in Belgium. The th RIR Association were on their annual pilgrimage to the WW battlefields, taking part in the July  ceremonies on the Somme before visiting other sites. Editor’s note: Robert Herbinson was born at Clonavon, Ballymena and is buried at Ration Farm Cemetery Annexe, Ploegsteert, Belgium and commemorated in Wellington Street Presbyterian Church. Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th. Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"10k for northern ireland civil servant offended by portraits of queen and philip peer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lord Maginnis, the former Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, told Parliament that the situation had been “shrouded in secrecy” and that the \"quite scandalous episode” now undermined Mr Hegarty’s role at the Commission.Speaking in the Lords on Wednesday night, Lord Maginnis said: “It has come to my attention that around £, was paid in compensation to a civil servant who was offended at having to walk past portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.“This inidual, who had worked in the NIO for between  and  years, claimed that under human rights legislation it was unfair to him to have to work where he was offended by portraits. The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis. “One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland. He said they had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.“This is scandalous.

At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we

problems within the districtrsquos planning department have been laid bare in a Newry, Mourne and Down Council report which has been made public.The local authority mdash which is responsible for district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its

leisure facility in Newcastle  ","story":"AMBITIOUS plans for a new community centre in the heart of Newcastle are expected to include an indoor water facility, it has emerged.Consultants have been appointed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to complete a feasibility study on new leisure provision in the resort, with the current Newcastle Centre and adjoining Tropicana outdoor swimming pool the favoured site.Last October, the Recorder exclusively revealed that plans for a major new leisure facility in the heart of the town were back on the agenda, with consultants set to be asked to carry out a study of potential sites.Two locations were previously identied for a new multi-million pound leisure centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl which recently secured planning approval for an ultra-modern new store.Recognising that Newcastle is one Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, council officials are keen to deliver a new indoor facility which people can use all year round.Politicians are also keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure a facility which has been talked about for decades is finally delivered in Newcastle mdash one that includes some form of indoor water facility.The council is keen to ascertain the proposed redevelopments costs for the entire Newcastle Centre site which includes the outdoor Tropicana pool and tourist information centre, the latter of which recently celebrated its th anniversary.Council officials want to know what the costs are so the scheme can be included in the local authorityrsquos capital development programme. They are keen to look at a mix of community facilities alongside some sort of indoor water leisure type facility which will replace the ageing Tropicana.In addition to plans for a new community centre, work is continuing on plans to secure a multi-million pound tourism bonanza for the resort through a series of innovative proposals.They are aimed at overhauling current tourist provision and signicantly increasing the number of overnight visitors to the resort as part of the City Deal initiative.A project board has been set up to help oversee the proposed investment initiative in Newcastle, with the local authority one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who hope to bid for a share of a poundbn investment package to fund a series of future projects, including tourism.The local authority and its City Deal partners have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive. It is anticipated that the city deal initiative has the potential to help the councils create , new jobs over a -year period.City deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is hoping to secure poundm from the NI Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund highly ambitious proposals in Newcastle aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort which form the core of its Mourne Gateway Project.Exciting proposals to signicantly enhance tourism attractions to draw international visitors to world class attractions in the resort include a gondola ride into the heart of the mountains and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.Other proposals include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy, an indoor activity centre in Donard Park, elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park and a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve.The ious proposals remain at an early stage and continue to be developed, with the next steps involving the development of a full outline business case for the overall project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ross selected for youth leadership programme  ","story":"A CROSSGAR teenager has been chosen to join the first group to begin a year-long international youth leadership programme which will culminate with a once in a letime trip to Los Angeles.Seventeen year-old Ross Farrell, a Year  student at Wellington College in Belfast, has earned his place on the IGNITE programme, a joint initiative between Belfast City Airport and Cinemagic, which will provide potentially le-changing opportunities for  young people over a five-year period.He was one of several students nominated by their schools who were then required to fill in an application form.Successful applicants were invited along to a selection day at the airport where they participated in a series of role-plays, team-building exercises and an interview.Jay Roewe, senior vice president of HBO, West Coast Productions, who is widely accredited for helping to bring Game of Thrones to Northern Ireland, met with the students at the launch of the programme at the airport.Michelle Hatfield, director of corporate services for George Best Belfast City Airport, said that over the course of the year, participants will collaborate with youth organisations, foundations, charities, representatives from other businesses in the private sector and also recognised names in the field of sport, film and politics.She added: ldquoWhilst the trip will conclude at a VIP gala event in Santa Monica, it is hoped that the lessons learned and the connections made by the young people involved will last a letime.Lord Mayor of Belfast John Finucane offered his encouragement to the young people participating in the programme.He said: ldquoIGNITE holds the potential to build the confidence, leadership and social skills of every young person involved.

I knew it could play to my strengths eventually, but being new to it, I wasnrsquot expecting to be as competitive just yet.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”Lord Maginnis went on: “He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland. “One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens. “I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”Lord Maginnis said that last year, some time after the compensation, Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.Addressing a largely empty House of Lords, the peer contrasted what he said had happened with the civil servant to the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland, who he said had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.He added: “This is scandalous.

Office not only to restore the original portraits of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh but to expedite payment of the comparatively paltry compensation due to the people who are more deserving than this opportunistic civil servant who, surely, must now be compromised in his position in the Parades Commission because of his bigoted stance over the Royal Family.”When asked about what Lord

They want their truth – truth on their terms.”He added: “If history portrays them for what they were – terrorists – then rewrite the history and reinvent the English language.”It was noted that the security forces have enjoyed no amnesty of the kind which has de facto been given to many terrorists, adding that “the Orange Institution unapologetically supports our security forces and we pay tribute to their service and sacrice”.He also made reference to a recent news story, covered by the News Letter, about Tyrone GAA players bursting into song on their bus while a loyalist parade took place outside the static vehicle.The song, Come Out You Black And Tans, glories the IRA, and the incident drew an apology from Tyrone GAA boss Mickey Harte.The singing “could have led to an incident of a serious nature”, said Rev Gibson, adding that it “demands a police investigation”.And on the subject of the recent Westminster developments on marriage and abortion, Rev Gibson said: “The world may have moved from God’s word on these matters, but the Orange Institution remains committed to the whole counsel of scripture – there can be no ambiguity.“October  will be a sad day for Northern Irelandthere is no Assembly in place it will show that both lives don’t matter, a child in the womb will become a mere medical procedure, God’s ordained purpose of marriage will be thwarted ... Sadly, some changes are inevitable, so it is important that we respond to such moral changes with compassion and grace.Leak of bonfire names is unlikely to have come from PSNI, says top officerIrish tricolour is hoisted above rural Orange lodge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We may not agree with these new changes, but our response must be that of Christ – love and compassionate action, not mere condemnation and criticism.”When it came to the parade itself in the west Tyrone village, around  lodges and a similar number of bands took part.A total of six districts with lodges representing Killen, Sixmilecross, Fintona, Newtownstewart, Omagh, and Strabane were on parade.This year also saw street performers incorporated into proceedings including Lambeg drums, highland dancers and much more.The main parade left the assembly field on the Longland Road at .pm and proceeded to the Berryhill Road where the demonstration field was located.Speaking with Rev Gibson was Brother Derek Reaney, assistant grand master, and the religious service was conducted by Co Tyrone Grand Chaplain, Brother Rev David Reid, assisted by Brother Rev Alan Irwin.William Scanlon, secretary of Bready LOL and Strabane district secretary, said: “Everything was %.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Among the start-up activities in the Centre will be classes in woodwork, woodcarving, cooking and baking and a range of arts and crafts.In the longer term it is hoped that the Centre will also be able to offer classes in pottery, gardening and horticulture and knitting and sowing. All the classes will be taught by experienced practitioners who are happy to put their gts at the service of the community.For those interested in outdoor physical exercise the Centre will organise opportunities for groups to walk, swim and cycle. An important part of the work of this new project will be to address the issue of the stigma associated with mental health. To this end the Centre will offer sessions on topics such as depression, anxiety, addiction, grief and low self-esteem. It will also help those who need to talk about themselves and their lives by providing a safe and confidential listening service. All activities at the Portadown Wellness Centre will be free of charge. It is hoped that funding will be provided by both the public and private sectors.Already positive negotiations have taken place with The National Lottery, The Department of Communities, The Southern Trust, Armagh, Banbridge  Craigavon Borough Council and The Housing Executive. Leading local employers have also agreed to support the project.These include Asda Portadown, Tesco Portadown, Sainsbury’s Craigavon and Thompson Aero Seating.The Portadown Wellness Centre will be governed by a caring and experienced board of management.The board members are Norma McConville MBE, Alan McDowell, Philip McParland, Lynsey Bannon, Tesco Portadown, Elaine Livingstone, Asda Portadown, Dwain Tollent, Sainsbury’s Craigavon, Karen Nixon, Thompson Aero Seating.For further information about Portadown Wellness Centre and its activities and plans contact Alan McDowell, Secretary, on Tel:    or email: alanmcdowell@gmail.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.
