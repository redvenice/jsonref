She did help him move and stayed that night at his flat.\u0027He left quite early the following morning and when he returned, Ripley informed him she had been out for a walk, closing, but not locking, the door.\u0027His evidence was that later he realised his Omega Constellation wristwatch was missing. There is no dispute the watch was in Ripley\u0027s possession when the relationship ended.\u0027Fairly early in the relationship, there was discussions about the transfer of funds. The sum was initially £40,000. but was supplemented a week later by a further £12,500.\u0027The victim\u0027s consistent account was that Ripley asked for a short term loan to facilitate a house move, in particular that she needed the money for a house purchase in Arundel. \u0027At the end of their relationship, he asked her about the return of the monies advanced and said she stated he had no proof it had been a loan.\u0027On July 1, 2017, the pair travelled to Ireland, where the victim had business interests. One task he wished to undertake was to pay a debt of approximately 4,000 Euros.\u0027His recollection is that Ripley took responsibility for placing the money in the room safe at the hotel and took particular interest in being involved in setting the combination.         While dating her victim she carried out Google searches for \u0027how to get a rich man to give you money\u0027, \u0027does cash show up on airport scanners\u0027 and \u0027how to get rid of your fingerprints\u0027\u0027The victim went alone to pay his debt, but when he arrived to do so and opened the envelope he discovered that it contained no money, but rather ripped up pages of what appeared to be a women\u0027s magazine.\u0027Their return from the trip to Ireland marked the end of the relationship. The victim was surprised to find Ripley had changed the seating arrangements on the flight so they did not sit together.\u0027On arriving back at his home, she put her case in her car and drove off.\u0027The hearing was also shown her internet searches, which also included one for Omega Constellation watches and how much money could be carried from Ireland to the UK.However, the tribunal was told that despite carrying out an investigation, Sussex Police had decided there was \u0027insufficient evidence\u0027 to charge Ripley and therefore they would not be pushing forward with a criminal case against her.The disciplinary panel said that although the misconduct was not related to her work, they felt they must ban her from continuing to be a registered social worker.The report added: \u0027There has been no acceptance of wrongdoing on the part of Ripley. She has shown no remorse or insight into her behaviour.\u0027Her actions were not victimless and took an emotional toll upon him. The panel believes there is a real risk of repetition. For these reasons, the panel is satisfied that making a striking off order is a proportionate response."},{"url":null,"title":"Namibias isolated Himba tribe use bright clay create incredible hairstyles make up","story":"Share this article          The men are often away from home for extended periods of time, with the Himba being a patriarchal and polygamous tribe.

My nine-year-old daughter Martha is something of an expert. Already a keen competitive swimmer, she has been nagging me for years to get a pool of her own (Tom with his daughter Martha)         Best for big gardens is Zodiac Hippo Original Rectangular Pool, £6,495, splashandrelax.co.ukSo how to cope? Simple. Get your own pop-up swimming pool — for the day.After all, if the sun’s only going to shine for a matter of hours, there’s little point in enduring the fuss, faff and considerable cost of maintaining one all-year-round.And while a paddling pool’s all well and good, when the heat’s on you want to submerge yourself in something a little bit more substantial. So, on Thursday, I put a call in to David Donald, whose company Splash and Tickle specialises in renting out swimming pools, hot tubs and spa equipment.‘Some people don’t want the hassle of a permanent pool,’ he tells me. ‘There’s all the effort of maintaining it year-round when you probably only want it for a couple of months. With a rented pool, you can have it for a weekend, a week or however long.’The one I order has a diameter of 5 metres and is a bit over 1 metre deep.         Best for smaller spaces is the Intex Easy Set Swimming Pool, £62.79, amazon.co.uk         Best for pool parties is Zodiac Winky Original Round Pool, £4,195, splashandrelax.co.ukWhile I won’t be swimming lengths in it, it holds a considerable amount of water — 11,000 litres to be precise — meaning that, unlike a paddling pool, it won’t become soupy hot within a few hours of the sun bursting through the clouds.It consists of a solid wooden frame which David slots together in three hours, inside which a heavy-duty plastic pool liner is fitted.‘Unlike one of those inflatable pools, you can lean on the sides and they won’t collapse,’ points out David.The pool comes with its own filtration and heating system and the pH and balance of the water is maintained with the addition of chemicals, as with a normal pool.Filling it with a hose will take the best part of a day — or if you can’t wait that long to cool down, you can order in a tanker of water which will fill it to the top in half an hour. But expect to pay £500 or so for the short cut.         Best for splashing cash is Laghetto Dolce Vita Pool 510, £18,000, agbudget.co.ukAs for the cost of the pool, it comes in at £1,200 for the weekend. But much of that cost covers delivery and putting it up, so a longer rental would make better financial sense.And while it may sound like a lot, the cost of installing a proper pool will cost you anything from £25,000 to £100,000-plus, depending on its size. On top of that are heating and maintenance costs which will add thousands each year. Worth it if it’s a scorching summer, but less so if the sun shines as rarely as it has done so far this year.As well as private clients, David’s pools are often to be found at corporate events and in the VIP camping sections of festivals. As well as the pool, he can provide a changing room complete with towels and lockers.          Best for staying up all summer is the Rectangular Steel Pro Frame Pool, £426.99, amazon.co.uk         Of course, when it comes to the pool itself, the proof is in the pudding. And my nine-year-old daughter Martha is something of an expert.Already a keen competitive swimmer, she has been nagging me for years to get a pool of her own.‘Perfect,’ she says, in between jumping in and sailing around on an inflatable pink flamingo. ‘Can we keep it?’Maybe for a bit, I tell her. And, of course, once the Saharan bubble bursts, I can always call up David and get him to pick up the pool — and replace it with one of his hot tubs. "},{"url":null,"title":"Diana match Charles hadnt boyfriends","story":"Share this article We stood in the hall, where Barbour mackintoshes and wellington boots were squashed next to an umbrella stand. It was like being in a rambling country house. She was in blue jeans and a twin-set with pearls, which she fingered constantly.As I walked into the flat, Diana\u0027s shoulders were bowed as though standing straight would draw too much attention. Her skin was transparent and she blushed continuously, especially when talking about Charles. \u0027It\u0027s absolutely maddening to see things written about me, and him, when I haven\u0027t said anything.\u0027 She paused. \u0027But I don\u0027t know what the future holds.\u0027I asked if anyone was advising her on how to handle the situation. \u0027No!\u0027 she said, shocked. \u0027I don\u0027t think the Royal Family is aware of what is happening here. At least we didn\u0027t talk about it when we were in Norfolk.\u0027Apparently she\u0027d crept away at night the previous weekend to stay at Sandringham, managing to evade reporters. I wondered aloud if she\u0027d wound sheets together to climb out of the window. She laughed. \u0027No, I got a very fast driver and we shot off in a puff of smoke. I had my new car delivered somewhere else where I stayed the night, then shot off to Norfolk.\u0027 It was Prince Charles\u0027s 32nd birthday party. \u0027Unfortunately,\u0027 she added, \u0027somebody found out I had a new car and even though I parked it miles away they found it.\u0027So the siege went on. \u0027I\u0027ve no idea why the whole thing has built up to such a peak,\u0027 she shrugged. \u0027I think it\u0027s because everything happens for the Royal Family in November. Princess Anne married and had a baby in November. It\u0027s the Queen and Prince Philip\u0027s anniversary. And of course it\u0027s Charles\u0027s birthday and everyone is dying for him to get married, and I was the one who was around this time.\u0027A little disingenuous perhaps. Not every pretty young woman is asked to stay at Sandringham for these highly personal events.         Every morning when she tried to jump into her red Mini, photographers would race her to the first set of traffic lights, hoping she would be stopped long enough for them to get a shot or, worse, that they would cause a little accident, which would give a more dramatic shotThen she changed the subject, apologising for what a nuisance all the attention must be for other people in our building. \u0027It must be so bloody for everyone who lives here,\u0027 she said. \u0027I feel so awful about it.\u0027 I assured her we were taking it in our collective stride.I knew she wanted me to write what she said, although she was afraid to say much. She thought she was \u0027suitable\u0027 for a future king, only because she did not \u0027sleep around\u0027. It was clear she thought herself second best to her older sister, who had been Prince Charles\u0027s girlfriend for almost a year but had been crossed off the eligibility list. Not for lack of blue blood – the Spencer blood was probably bluer than the Windsors\u0027 – but for reportedly telling journalists she\u0027d had \u0027thousands of boyfriends\u0027. Diana strongly implied she was a virgin, and she obviously felt that was the only reason \u0027The Family\u0027 had approved her as a future bride, although I did not write that in my interview. \u0027I don\u0027t really know why they like me,\u0027 was what I wrote. \u0027You see my sister Sarah was going out with Charles last year and she talked about it to the Press but she talked too much and they murdered her.\u0027I\u0027m OK because I haven\u0027t got a background.\u0027 I looked surprised. No background? Daughter of the 8th Earl Spencer, distantly related to the Royal Family, directly related to the Churchills? No, it turned out she meant a background of leaping in and out of bed with people. \u0027That\u0027s what everyone else seems to have. I mean I haven\u0027t had a chance to have that kind of background, I\u0027m still only 19!\u0027 She looked shocked and embarrassed. \u0027But people are longing to dig something up about me.\u0027 She looked at me sideways. \u0027It\u0027s like the story about me meeting him on the Royal Train in the middle of the night.\u0027She was referring to reports, denied by the Palace, that she\u0027d had an assignation with the prince when the train was in sidings in Wiltshire. \u0027I simply couldn\u0027t believe it,\u0027 she exploded. \u0027I\u0027ve never been near the train, let alone in the middle of the night!\u0027 I was told later, by a reliable source, that the woman on board was Camilla.I was very sympathetic, but as I turned to go, realising a cup of tea was not on the cards, she apologised again for the disruption she\u0027d caused to others in our building. \u0027I am so, so sorry for interrupting the lives of the people who live here,\u0027 she said.She told me when she was finally allowed a bodyguard, a woman dressed in black who shadowed her like a, well, shadow, a very dark one, but effective. I could see the top of the woman\u0027s head as I slipped down the stairs behind Diana, neither of us waiting for the old Victorian lift. None of the other members of the Press spotted her, that\u0027s for sure. Diana, soon to be HRH Princess of Wales, was learning her lesson.                 "},{"url":null,"title":"RICHARD KAY reveals astonishing life 6th Earl Carnarvon","story":"Share this article And, last year, Wynne, now 90, was reunited with them. To his amazement, they were in reasonable condition and the sound quality was almost as good as he remembered.Wynne’s cache of tapes is an extraordinary record of a golden history of one of our most popular country houses — particularly in the context of a big-screen version of Downton Abbey, due later this year.The storyline of the film sees Downton preparing for a royal visit by George V and Queen Mary in 1927. Intriguingly, this fictional visit is set just four years after Carnarvon had inherited the earldom and with it Highclere Castle. With fact and fiction so aligned, the history of the tapes adds significance.The story begins in 1973, when Barry Wynne, who helped launch Thames Television, received a phone call from the then 75-year-old Lord Carnarvon. A year earlier, Wynne had written a well-received book about one of the great archaeological finds of the 20th century, the tomb of Tutankhamun. It was a subject close to Carnarvon, whose father had funded the expedition.But the peer did not want to talk about his father. Encouraged by the publisher Lord Weidenfeld, who wanted ‘all the dirt’ on a man reputed to be one of the great rakes of the 20th century, Wynne and Carnarvon set to work.         The dancer and Prochy\u0027s second wife Tilly Losch ‘Here he was in his mid-70s and he wanted to put down a record of his life,’ says Wynne. ‘He was great raconteur.’But, having signed his acceptance of the manuscript, the peer, under pressure from his advisors about the frank reminiscences, had second thoughts. Baffled when Carnarvon pulled the plug on the enterprise, Wynne’s shock only increased when he was summoned to the office of the earl’s London solicitors.‘From a drawer, his lawyer pulled out a wad of £1 notes and counted out 50 of them,’ Wynne recalls. ‘I particularly remember that they were used notes, that seemed deliberate.’ It was the act of a crashing snob. ‘Of course, I walked out on the spot.’After finally securing a payoff, Wynne handed over a copy of the manuscript and his notes, but not the tapes. According to him, the recordings were not part of the action.‘They were mine, not Carnarvon’s, made on my wife’s tape machine.’Nevertheless, he sent the tapes to his sister’s home in Paris for safekeeping. They remained there for 25 years before being moved to his agent’s office in Central London for a further 15 years. In recent times, they had been looked after by his younger daughter, which was when they went missing.After two failed marriages and a decade living on a yacht, Wynne has now settled in Cyprus. And it was there that he received the call to tell him the tapes had been found.It came from his daughter’s ex-boyfriend, who said his father was selling a hotel in the market town of Louth, when at the back of a cupboard he found the box of tapes.‘I didn’t know this young man but I remember it was Boxing Day and I told him he’d given me the best Christmas present ever,’ Wynne says.The tapes are once again safe under lock and key with Wynne’s solicitors. What is on them is bound to fascinate historians and broadcasters. Few figures in the racy Twenties and Thirties were as louche and as well connected as Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon.Known as Porchy after his courtesy title Lord Porchester, he was a soldier, sportsman, bloodstock breeder, exhibitionist, chat-show guest and apparently lover of half the women of Berkshire.According to a wonderfully indiscreet obituary, he liked to tell how, as a young cavalry subaltern, he had been chased through the back gardens of Maidenhead by cuckolded husbands. It described him as a ‘most uncompromisingly direct ladies man’, a euphemism to describe a flasher.He thought nothing of taking other men’s wives as his mistresses. One was Joan Bowes-Lyon, a noted beauty and a cousin of the Queen Mother. She was married to Frank Bellville, a fellow soldier, who attempted to blackmail Porchy by threatening to expose the affair unless he paid him £10,000.Convinced he had been entrapped, Porchester refused to pay and broke off the affair.         Highclere Castle, which features as Downton Abbey in the hit ITV television series As a child, he told Wynne, he lived in fear of his forbidding and dissolute father and his rich but cold mother, Almina, illegitimate daughter of Alfred de Rothschild, a flamboyant member of the banking family.He recalled how, as a ten-year-old boy, he was taken to a Christmas party at Buckingham Palace where he collided with the portly Edward VII, knocking him to the ground. He then compounded this social faux pas by spilling ice cream over the king’s granddaughter Princess Mary’s new day-dress.For this he was beaten by his furious, social-climbing mother, who then instructed the family butler to lock him in an attic and feed him only bread and water for two days as punishment for disgracing the Carnarvon name.It was nothing to humiliations visited on him by his father. After a bad school report, the young Porchy was ordered to undress and bend over, whereupon his father, armed with a birch rod, gave him six strokes on his bare backside.A page at the Coronation of George V in 1911, he remembered the waxed moustaches of Germany’s Kaiser and the Russian Tsar. During World War I, when serving with the 7th Hussars in Mesopotamia, his horse was shot from under him and a bullet pierced his pith helmet. He also led a firing squad which executed a Turk spy. Afterwards, his hands shook so much he was unable to withdraw his pistol to deliver the coup de grace and threw up.But he had no such qualms when he saw an Arab cutting off the boots of a dead brother officer. Drawing his pistol, he shot the man dead. He also helped himself to the field glasses of a dead Turk officer, which he used for racing for the rest of his life.After the death of the 5th earl, Porchester secured the financial future of Highclere by slashing estate staff numbers and selling works of art. To raise more money, he turned his pastime for rearing racehorses and gambling on them into a profession.During the abdication crisis, he was asked to intervene by the Royal Family. As a close friend of Edward VIII, he met the king in a Turkish bath in St James’s, and appealed to him to keep Wallis Simpson as his mistress, but not to make her his wife.His own marital record was hardly unblemished. He married twice, first to American Catherine Wendell and then to Austrian-born dancer and Hollywood star Tilly Losch. Both ended in orce. Catherine had abandoned the family home because of his philandering, and years later he attempted to sue Tilly for desertion after she, too, ran out on him.Despite his reputation, he was not always successful with the opposite sex. In 1936, he was reported in New York to be engaged to society beauty Tanis Guinness, but she jilted him and eloped to Mexico with a screenwriter.Ten years later, his name was linked with the British actress Jeanne Stewart and, in the late Fifties, he was said to be contemplating marriage to Mme Jacqueline Descamps, the blonde daughter of a Belgian baroness, who was almost half his age.Even so, with Downton Abbey set to return to the screen later this summer, the real-life saga of the scion of Highclere and the new-found tapes reveal a story every bit as dramatic. "},{"url":null,"title":"Kynren Bishop Auckland transforms northern town","story":"Share this article ‘Its addictive. It’s infectious. It makes everything in your life better,’ says Christine Chisholm, a dementia carer who is part of the mounted cavalry team. ‘I’ve made so many friends and I’m so grateful.’ Another cavalry member chips in. ‘We’re all grateful to Jonathan.’Indeed, Jonathan Ruffer’s name is forever popping up. How he has changed everything. How he has bought Bishop Auckland back to life. How he has reconnected the town, with hundreds of new friendships cemented during rehearsals and performances.‘The town was on its knees. It was going to ruin,’ says Andrew, a middle-aged centurion and Great North Air Ambulance fundraiser.         A volunteer grapples with a donkey. As well as the volunteer cast, there are hundreds of ‘Experience’ Archers — welcomers who are given the same training as the London 2012 volunteer team. With tickets sales of about £4 million each year, the show is now self-funding. But Jonathan hasn’t stopped at Kynren. He has gone on to establish the Auckland Project, which is focused on regeneration of the area‘Kynren has given people a sense of pride, in their town, in themselves and it has completely changed all our lives because we’ve made so many friends. I was born in this town, but I have never had so many friends.’Bishop Auckland, once a beacon of the mining north, has struggled for nearly half a century to find new purpose since the last deep colliery closed in 1968. Butchers and fishmongers closed, the market square filled with discount outlets, charity shops and takeaways, and hope faded.Jonathan’s love affair with the place stems from his passion for old Spanish art. In particular 12 paintings by Francisco de Zurbaran, which had been housed since 1756 in Auckland Castle, one of Europe’s best preserved former ‘bishops’ palaces’.When, in 2013, the Church of England announced they were selling the paintings to help fund priests working in poor areas, Jonathan — a gentle, bespectacled chap who grew up 30 miles away in Stokesley — offered to buy them. And then, because it seemed a shame to move them, he bought the castle, too, in a job lot that cost £15 million.‘I was persuaded, quite reluctantly, to take the castle — these old buildings can be absolute nightmares,’ he says.But he soon realised that keeping the Zubarans was neither here nor there to most people in Bishop, as locals call it.‘Would this be good for the community?’ he says ruefully. ‘It was a futile gesture.’ And then a golf course became available nearby, and Jonathan, an evangelical Christian since an epiphany as a student at Cambridge, had what he likens to Abraham’s calling by God.‘Abraham was called on a journey, but he wasn’t given the destination. That is exactly what’s happened to me,’ he says. ‘I could not possibly have not done what I’m doing, but I still don’t know what the plan is.’Perhaps not, but he found himself donating another £35 million to set up the charity, Eleven Arches, and through it launched the idea of Kynren with the help of expert advisers in the hope it would show the doubters — pretty much everyone who had heard his bonkers proposition — and revitalise the community.Jonathan, who is married to a palliative care doctor and has a daughter, isn’t the sort to do things by half. He wanted to deliver the same success as Puy du Fou and so he persuaded a member of its board to help his new charity.He also asked Roxanna Smith, Gina Martinez and Katie Pearson, who choreographed the Olympic opening ceremony, to help.Music was commissioned from Nathan Stornetta, who worked on Pirates Of The Caribbean, while local celebrity, Kevin Whately, of Inspector Morse and Lewis fame, provided voice-overs.Jonathan also managed to persuade Anna Warnecke, an Olympian who represented her native Germany in three-day eventing for 20 years, to join as Head of Cavalry and Estates.As well as the volunteer cast, there are hundreds of ‘Experience’ Archers — welcomers who are given the same training as the London 2012 volunteer team.With tickets sales of about £4 million each year, the show is now self-funding. But Jonathan hasn’t stopped at Kynren. He has gone on to establish the Auckland Project, which is focused on regeneration of the area.So there is now a new 15ft viewing tower over the town, a gallery featuring mining-themed work by prominent artists and, to come, a new museum on the history of Christianity. And of course there is the castle, which has undergone an £18 million refurbishment — Jonathan and his family live in a lodge in the grounds — and will open to visitors.When I arrive at the site three days before opening night, I find the atmosphere joyful and the scale astonishing.         There are fountain ballets, a Viking longboat that rises out of a purpose-built lake courtesy of underwater ers, a burning village, flaming arrows, the re-enactment of a mining disaster of the 1870s, the Coronation and 100kg of fireworks lighting up every showThere is a huge area of landscaped meadows, stable blocks, 16 huge changing rooms (known as villages), a wooden 8,000-seat stand and the ‘stage’ — actually a vast expanse of lake, castle, railway and cathedral — with Auckland Castle, which is illuminated at night, as a stunning backdrop to the show.Sadly, I am too late to join the jousting, or practise being dragged along on a rope behind a horse, learn a complex dance routine, or drive Boudicca’s chariot. But the mantra at Kynren is that there is something for everyone.So I spear some plastic fish with a wooden pitchfork and chat with Karen, who assures me that coming to Kynren rehearsals with her husband several times a week has revitalised their marriage.Next, I mend a fishing net, stir the boiling cabbage broth for the Vikings and then rehearse for a Roman chariot ride. The chariot is driven by a very handsome centurion called David and pulled by four thoroughbred horses.The attention to detail is astonishing. Every piece of tack is glossy and gleaming. Every centurion helmet (apart from, perhaps, mine) is straight and every tassel tangle-free.We do loop after loop past the empty stands, perfecting timing, formation and posture.The logistics are mind-blowing. And that’s even before they start herding 150 animals and 1,000 volunteers into each show.Each Archer plays multiple parts, changing up to six times in the course of a performance. The costume department has more than 10,000 items — doublets, royal regalia, Boudicca’s feathered headdress, thousands of boots and belts and gloves.A huge team of mostly volunteers, aged from 42 to 78, work all year round sewing, fixing, laundering or, more often than not, just spraying everything with diluted vodka. ‘It gets rid of the bacteria very nicely,’ says Chris Livingstone, a retired civil servant whose sister was a costume designer for Elton John and Queen. (‘It’s in the blood,’ she says.)As opening night approaches, the hours put in by the core team spiral — 18-20 hour days are standard, says Anna Warnecke.No one is bothering about overtime. Everyone — even the small number of paid staff — volunteers on show nights. And, oddly, no one seems to care about the weather.But there is fevered excitement for the now-legendary opening and closing show parties. ‘The after-party went on so long last year, I went home on the milk float,’ says Andrew, the centurion. How bloody brilliant!The impact of Kynren is extraordinary. Entire families embrace it, and volunteers hail from all parts of the local community — from hospital consultants to the long-term unemployed.Every person I talk to glows when talking about the show and how it has affected their lives.Leia, a 19-year- old apprentice at a lawnmower manufacturer, tells me she has high-functioning autism and usually struggles to make friends. ‘But not here!’‘We’re all looking up now, not down,’ says one of the hairy Vikings. ‘It’s impossible to walk through the town now without bumping into new friends.’‘Some people were sceptical at first,’ says Karen, my fish-spearing friend. ‘They’d ask, “Why would you want to give up all that time when you’re not getting paid for it?” But we’re not giving up anything. We’re having a great time!’Lucy, who is on the Kynren staff, just throws up her arms and says: ‘Bishop is the best place in the world now, because just look what we’ve got here.’It goes without saying that almost everyone who takes part returns the following year. ‘We count down the winter months,’ a member of the cavalry tells me.But there is always room for more and this year’s newbies include Jeremy, a Vikingcenturion (in real life, a manager for Specsavers), who was dragged along by his wife and daughter and is feeling ‘a bit nervous’.Of course he’s nervous! He’s going to perform live in front of 8,000 people in an utterly brilliant, extraordinarily bananas yet highly professional show which delights, astonishes, inspires and, most of all, has helped to mend a broken and dispirited community.But I bet my centurion helmet he’ll be back next year."},{"url":null,"title":"The sweeping changes coming Australia July 1 affect bank balance","story":"Share this article Residents will also be given easier access to lower priced electricity thanks to a new Electricity Retail Code for retailers in southeast Queensland, NSW and South Australia. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the government\u0027s plans were the best catered for everyday Australians. \u0027In the face of significant headwinds, our economic plan has the right focus on tax, infrastructure and skills,\u0027 he said.\u0027At a time of significant global economic change, Australians have reason to be confident about their future.          Residents will be given easier access to lower priced electricity thanks to a new Electricity Retail Code for retailers in southeast Queensland, NSW and South Australia (file photo)\u0027Yes, there are significant challenges, including trade tensions, the uncertainty of Brexit and the domestic impact of flood and drought, but we have the economic plan to see us through.\u0027The new retail code will make it easier for consumers to compare prices and offers.

Playing from its disembodied head was a dizzying barrage of techno, bass and electronic noise from some of the world’s most cutting-edge artists.In the crowd meanwhile, body glitter – hopefully biodegradable! – remains the accessory of choice.Sheryl Crow generated some of the biggest singalongs of the day for the likes of If It Makes You Happy – and even had her two young sons working as guitar technicians. As Michael Cragg noted: “By the time the classic Everyday Is a Winding Road kicks in, she’s back in the crowd’s palm, posing for photos and even sharing a kiss with a sunburnt punter.”Aside from walking about eight miles a day, yoga is the exercise of choice at Glastonbury – and Power Ballad Yoga adds an extra impetus for all those outstretched arms.George Ezra’s buoyant, boyish music simply wouldn’t make sense in Glastonbury’s classic drizzle. But luckily for him – perhaps because of him? – the crowd was indeed firmly “underneath the hot sun” for his set. As the ’s Laura Snapes said: “In this miserable day and age, only a churl would resist Ezra’s sunbeam blast of charisma.”Bastille played a blinder, leaning into their set like headliners and making one of the clearest political statements of the day: singer Dan Smith draping himself in an EU flag.And there’s still two more days to go!

A coalition of more than 35 human rights, justice and community organisations wrote to the government in September last year.“We cannot let another generation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people lose their futures, their dignity and – for some – their lives because of inaction by Australian governments,” said the letter signed by Amnesty, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Law Council of Australia, Unicef, national Aboriginal legal and social services, legal academics and others.The ALRC report recommended a national justice reinvestment body, support for justice reinvestment trials around the country, and national criminal justice targets.Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt said he is aware this report has been sitting with the government “for some time” and will be giving it his consideration.“I am also acutely aware of the increasing imprisonment rate of Indigenous women and the need for all governments to do more to address the issues that are driving this,” the minister told  Australia.“We need to ensure these strategies are community driven and reflect the needs and lived experiences of Indigenous women, their families and communities,” he said.Speaking in Geneva, June Oscar said: “We must invest in prevention through provision of wrap-around supports to our families, and we must ensure that real alternatives to incarceration become viable options.”Earlier this week, Oscar launched an exhibition of photographs, Hear Us, See Us, of the many women she has spoken to for the Wiyi Yani U Thangani (Women’s Voices, in Oscar’s Bunuba language) project.The project is the first time in more than 30 years that a formal inquiry into the status of Indigenous women has been held. Oscar and her team have travelled to 50 communities in every state and territory in Australia, speaking with 2,294 women and girls.The key issues emerging are the need for a voice at a regional and national level “that represents us, on our own terms, and cannot be abolished with the stroke of a pen”, Oscar said at the exhibition launch.“We need increased investment in health and the social determinants of health. We need to bring an end to punitive welfare compliance regimes which impact Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people disproportionally.“We must reform what has become an increasingly punitive justice system that incarcerates our people at 10 times the rate of other Australians, and invest in effective rehabilitative supports.“We must halt the development of a second stolen generation by supporting Indigenous families and communities to care for themselves and their children, and by ensuring that state governments adhere strictly to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child placement principle.“Our children must grow up in culture, not in care outside of our communities,” Oscar said.“We must overhaul the Native Title Act, which in its current form does not provide for a just and equitable native title system.“All these measures are about giving full effect to our human rights, rights which are enshrined in international treaties which the Australian government has ratified or endorsed.”The Wiyi Yani u Thangani report is due to be released in September.“I will be working closely with the Commissioner,” Ken Wyatt said, “with the recommendations from this project informing the changes required across governments to better support Indigenous women and their families.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/973c3b7fc30c2dc5cf69cd92c4987e1277473c9e/0_72_5796_3479/master/5796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705777d12fb36d18e0d460101f2a407c","title":"a history of the bible by john barton review","story":"Did Jesus talk about being God’s son, or did the gospels tell it that way? A fascinating, wise exploration of the Bible’s evolutionA quiz question, which is also a trick question: how many references to the doctrine of the Trinity are there in the Bible? The answer: two, at a pinch. One of them was probably inserted into the text of the Gospel of John by a zealous scribe well after the gospel was written. This is known as “the Johannine comma” (where comma means “clause” or “phrase”). The other (in Matthew) was also probably a later addition by a pious scribe.As John Barton shows in this massive and fascinating book, the Bible really did have a history. It grew and developed. As its disparate books were gradually integrated into the theological structures of the church, scribes would engage in what is called “the orthodox corruption of scripture”. So once the notion that God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit were all equal persons of the Trinity was established it became natural to seek confirmation of that doctrine in the Bible.The Epistles of St Paul were probably written not long after the death of Christ, in the AD40s or 50s. St Paul appears to have been an “adoptionist” who held that Jesus was adopted as Son of God at the resurrection rather than a believer in the Trinity.The gospels (which show knowledge of the fall of the Jerusalem Temple in AD70) were written at least two decades after Paul’s epistles. And the Gospel of John was possibly written as late as the second century. It presents a Jesus who talks a great deal about his own status as God’s son. This more likely reflects the beliefs of a later era than that of Jesus himself, and John’s gospel may indeed be a biography of Christ written to suit the interests and beliefs of John’s own particular branch of Christianity. The episode of the woman taken in adultery – “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her” – which appears only in this gospel, is not found in the earliest manuscripts, and is likely to be an even later addition.Does this mean that Barton’s history of the Bible provides an armoury of arguments for religious sceptics? Well, the sceptical will certainly find material here to deploy. But Barton – who is an Anglican with Lutheran leanings – believes that it’s perfectly possible to see the Bible as a book with its own history and also to regard it as a repository of religious truths.He views the New Testament as a collection of records written by different people, probably for different religious communities, at different times. The gospels were preserved not in scrolls but in codices – bound volumes with separate leaves – and were “not fixed Scripture but simply the reminiscences of the Apostles”. That explains why they can be internally inconsistent, but also how they can be thought of as texts that give a range of different angles on the life of Christ, even if they don’t all relate (in that common phrase) the gospel truth.Barton opposes Dan Brown-style conspiracy theorists who think that some time in the fourth century a powerful church suppressed a range of heterodox scriptures and created the New Testament as we now know it. He argues convincingly that by the second century there was a loose canon of holy books that were broadly similar to those included in the Bible today.Although Barton is a Christian he’s also an excellent guide to the composition of what is usually called the “Old Testament” – though, as he reminds us, that name implies that the Hebrew Bible (as he prefers to call it) is no more than a precursor to the New Testament. Early Christian thinkers saw it this way. They regarded the life of Christ as the great truth towards which the Hebrew prophets and scriptures pointed, and which superseded the old faith and its laws. They read the Hebrew Bible as a story of disobedience and falling: Adam and Eve fell, and then Christ reversed the effects of that fall. That could go along with hostility to Jewish beliefs, and even antisemitism. For the majority of Jews, however, the Hebrew Bible was “not at all about fall and redemption, but about how to live a faithful life in the ups and downs of the ongoing history of the people of Israel”.The Hebrew Bible itself developed over a long period, probably from about the eighth to the second century BC. Barton suggests that the Book of Proverbs may well have been produced by something like Israel’s civil service. Job and Ecclesiastes are much later works, possibly written by iniduals. The Psalter, a mixture of liturgy, national history and inidual experience, which Barton describes as “a mess”, probably came together in about 300BC, although inidual psalms may be much older than this.The historical method of analysing layers of composition in the Bible even casts a faint shadow over the Ten Commandments. They are delivered on tablets of stone to an early itinerant nation. But since they include the commandment “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house ... nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass”, they imply “a settled agrarian community”.If the tablets of stone of the decalogue seem to crumble at the edges when the Bible is subjected to historical analysis, then Barton’s readers might wonder how religious faith can coexist with a Bible that is regarded as an internally contradictory text with a long history and erse cultural origins.Sceptics, indeed, might find in his magisterial overview of the history of the Bible clear evidence that orthodox religions are grounded in the beliefs of communities rather than in a single authoritative text that records the word of God.Believers, on the other hand, might follow him in taking a flexible view of the Bible as a collection of texts that preserve reminiscences of the life of Jesus and about God and how to worship him. Barton says this history is “the story of the interplay between religion and the book – neither mapping exactly onto the other”. Problems arise when interpreters try to impose orthodox religious beliefs on its text: “The extreme ersity of the material in the Bible is not to be reduced by extracting essential principles, but embraced as a celebration of variety.”That might sound like wishy-washy Anglicanism. But there is a lot of argumentative muscle in Barton’s book. He aims to “dispel the image of the Bible as a sacred monolith between two black leather covers”. So he has little time for fundamentalists and Biblical literalists who believe that its every word is sacred. He also doesn’t have much patience with devotees of the Authorised Version. He quotes a billboard outside a Baptist church in North Carolina that says: “Are you tired of hearing your pastor correct the preserved word of God (the Authorised King James Version) with the Greek or other translations?”, which seems to suggest that the Authorised Version is the original and not a translation from Greek. And it is not always the best translation: the vigour of William Tyndale’s description of Joseph (“the Lord was with Joseph and he was a lucky fellow”) makes the Alternative Version seem stodgy and corporate: “Joseph was a goodly person, and well-favoured.”Two aspects of his account are particularly impressive. One is its phenomenal range of learning. The other is the moderation and quiet wisdom with which it conveys that learning. Barton knows he’s tiptoeing through a minefield. His way through is to sift evidence carefully, and to be aware of ways in which his own religious position might influence his interpretation of this most complex and contentious of texts. He believes the Bible “presents a range of ideas about Jesus and about God that cannot be systematised”. His belief in the plurality of the texts gathered together as Ta Biblia (Greek for “the books” – so the very title of the Bible is plural) brings with it a respectful pluralism in his attitudes towards religious faiths. So this is a heavy book from which believers and non-believers can both learn. And its overall message is deeply and laudably tolerant.• Colin Burrow’s Imitating Authors: Plato to Futurity is published by Oxford. A History of the Bible is published by Allen Lane (RRP £22).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Thomas Wolfe told us that you can never go home again. But you can do some re-reading, as Diane Cano explains:Re-reading in my ninth decade a book I first read as an adolescent: Look Homeward, Angel, by Thomas Wolfe. Even as an adolescent I thought of it as a novel especially suited for young teenagers, full of enthusiasm and new pain. It is still racist and misogynist and full of (glorious) lists, but I am no longer the indignant girl I was. Now I just relax into the tolerance of knowing, with Auden, that Time “worships language and forgives everyone by whom it lives”. Oh, how Wolfe throws those words up, around, over and through - everything.“I am not sure why,” says gavernism, “but I am re reading The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Stevenson”:Perhaps because I feel that social media today plays the role that chemicals play in that novel: it opens up a dark side of us that can roam around in the dark, anonymously, doing as it pleases. The issue now, as with the novel, is that hidden never really stays hidden, does it?The Silk Roads: A New History of the World by Peter Frankopan is “outstanding” according to darrylxxx:So many interesting stories, connections, insights and so easy to relate to where we are now as a global population. Shows how things ebb and flow over time – our current “reality” isn’t fixed in stone.“I do love Home Front diaries,” says NicolaVintageReads, who has been reading May Smith’s wartime diary These Wonderful Rumours:Ration books, Time and Tide magazine, sitting in a cold cellar waiting for the all-clear siren, tennis parties, wartime wedding cakes with cardboard imitation icing, seeing the newly released Disney films Dumbo and Pinocchio at the cinema, billeting evacuees, fear or Goering’s plans but spirit of the Blitz.WebberExpat is also “loving” Lucia Berlin’s A Manual For Cleaning Women:A bitterly hilarious, brutally truthful, elegantly incisive collection. Wonderful, just a brilliant, up-front, trusthworthy voice. One which does not overstay its welcome, nor get too repetitive meandering between stories.The sense of growing unease is palpable. I like the way Roth explores events – mainly a growing wave of anti-semitism in an isolationist America in WW2 governed by a right wing president – through the experience of a really well-defined young Jewish boy and his family.Becoming by Michelle Obama has impressed nicegirl2:I’m not really one for reading non-fiction but this is brilliant – so well written, smart, funny and humble (so far).Visions of Gerard by Jack Kerouac haunts dylan37:A childhood in the 1920s, a saintly hero brother who disappears too soon, Catholic dreams in a Massachusetts winter, survivor guilt and a family struggling with mourning.There’s a different kind of Kerouac energy here introspective, spiritual, angelic and natural. The ghosts of the great wanderers float through these words – William Blake and Walt Whitman, with the touch and feel of sad autumn leaves. There’s that strange melancholy of a dying season, disappearing like smoke from a slow burn bonfire. A haunting and beautiful small book, about the biggest of subjects.Red Bones by Ann Cleeves has intrigued jimitron5000:There is a certain slow burning intrigue about this book. The location adds an immense amount to the story and covers for the times when not much happens. It develops nicely into a really enjoyable novel. I have read the first two and will endeavour to read the rest of the series. Funnily enough I have never managed to sit through a whole episode of the TV show.Finally, a fascinating literary nugget from Zdzisław Najder’s, Joseph Conrad: A Life, courtesy of interwar:Pursuing Joseph Conrad’s beginnings as a writer, I came across this:In March 1893 the Torrens, “one of the most famous sailing ships of its day”, set sail from Adelaide, Australia on its return voyage to London. On board was a wealthy young English barrister who had been travelling round the Pacific. From shipboard he wrote to his mother about meeting a remarkable man, the ship’s Polish mate:“A capital chap, though queer to look at he is a man of travel and experience in many parts of the world, and has a fund of yarns .... He has been right up the Congo and all around Malacca and Borneo and other out of the way parts…”John Galsworthy had not yet turned to writing and his new friend, Konrad Korzeniowski, though secretly working on a novel, had not yet become Joseph Conrad. Both would remain friends, however, as they gained fame for their fiction.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Their suffering must endNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is an entirely innocent woman who has been held on trumped-up charges of espionage in Iranian jails since 2016. She holds dual British and Iranian citizenship, which the Iranian government does not recognise. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has been on hunger strike immediately outside the Iranian embassy for the last fortnight, in solidarity with the hunger strike she is herself maintaining in Evin jail in Tehran. The Iranian ambassador has complained that this protest makes his work impossible – and if it does, so much the better. The resolution to this crisis lies entirely in Iranian hands. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe should be released and reunited with her family. But – while the blame for her arrest and imprisonment belongs squarely to the Iranian regime – successive British governments have made the situation harder to resolve.Boris Johnson’s career as foreign secretary was undistinguished by anything except a lack of diplomacy but quite his worst gaffe was saying that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been “teaching journalism” in Iran when in fact she had simply been on a family holiday. This helped the Iranian authorities to politicise the case against her, since independent journalism is a subversive activity in Iran, as elsewhere in the Middle East. The Iranian government did not need any encouragement to seize and jail Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe but Mr Johnson anyway gave them what he could. Jeremy Corbyn, to his credit, has spoken out in support of her, and spent 40 minutes talking to Mr Ratcliffe outside the embassy earlier this week.Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at the airport at the end of a family trip to take her then 22-month-old daughter to visit her grandparents. Gabriella, the daughter, is now five, and has not seen her father since. It seems one motive was to use Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a hostage against the British government’s reluctance to release £400m paid over to Britain by the shah’s government before his overthrow in 1979 as part of an arms deal that was never completed. For nearly 40 years, British governments have refused to hand over the money on grounds that look wholly specious. The Foreign Office is prepared to bow to the numerous court judgments in Iran’s favour but the Ministry of Defence claims that the money would only be spent on unsavoury military adventures. This is an excuse that is distasteful as well as risible in the light of the UK’s support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, which is causing immense civilian suffering. Releasing the money would be the right thing to do. It might also be expedient.Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family are the entirely innocent victims of international power politics. Freeing her, and reuniting them, is the clear moral obligation of the Iranian government. The Zaghari-Ratcliffes have been on their hunger strikes, one in England and one in Tehran, for two weeks. It is past time to end their suffering with an act of justice and generosity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbdc70893628ad9361b8e2ef0c8a3d0c232c409/87_124_2336_1402/master/2336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ce93e761ba1297356aecd6a7ca8edf9","title":"karen voice demanding speak to manager","story":"The ‘I want to speak to the manager’ meme points to the essential brokenness of modern life: the corporate greed that fostered an I-Want-It-Now cultureA globally viral meme making my heart zing over recent years is the “Can I speak to the manager?” one, in which a generation X white woman called Karen escalates a minor consumer gripe to the highest level, from beneath a heaving two-tone choppy bob. The hair is an attempt to stay youthful, but appears to have been dyed and styled by ebullient badgers. More of Karen later.Memes were once just people “dicking about on the internet”, yet are now one of the Earth’s most valuable forms of communication. They distil into a single image, or loop of video, an obscure yet still universally understood circumstance, often involving emotions that actual human words cannot quite nail.Thus a blinking blond man channels the incredulity on reading a credit card bill. Donald Glover brings pizza cheerfully back into a room that is now on fire. A dachshund with a large ugly shoe on its head tells people, “It’s called fashion, Brenda, look it up.” Gen X “Karen” appeared back in 2014, wanting to speak to the manager. To my mind, this meme celebrated the chagrin of millions, nay, billions of millennial and generation Y frontline service-industry workers, for whom the scourge of their lives was a 45-year-old woman who might have waited more than 17 minutes to return a faulty five-blade spiralizer because their shop was understaffed.When Karen doubts the sincerity of the server’s apology, she goes into some sort of red-mist meltdown. Later, she will cry in her VW up! in the car park, listening to Michael Bublé – but right now, she’s on fire. The altercation might also take place via a call centre, in a restaurant or at the gym. Basically, anywhere that people work doing jobs they don’t enjoy, earning wages that won’t buy homes, rubbing up against older women fighting spiralling oestrogen, a maze-like diary of thankless bloody chores and the underlying emotion that they’re as mad as hell and not going to take this any more.I get this. On several occasions, Je suis Karen. And quickening like the quickening spring, you bright young thing will one day become Karen, too. Yes, you with your upright tits who, right now, would merely shrug meaningfully at, say, wasting 7am-6pm waiting for a refrigerator delivery (from a youth on £7.67 per hour), only to have it cancelled on some trumped-up balderdash. Oh, no. Not me, not Karen. All together now, clear throats, full hearts: “Caaaaaaaaan I speak to the maaaaaanager?”On the surface, the Karen meme may well be about clashing generations: the useless Ys, the grumpy Xs, the selfish boomers and, of course, the millennials, who are the go-to punchbag when it comes to workplace fecklessness (despite some now being 36 years old, with greying hair and teenage children). But for me, the more interesting underbelly points to the essential brokenness of modern life: the corporate greed that fostered an I-Want-It-Now culture, and a low-paid, uninspired, gig economy. Longer days, busier lives, more uncertainty, less joy, more fighting with Karen. The unstoppable force of global consumerism, which leads to 22-year-olds running around an Amazon fulfilment centre, and an immovable mass of knackered gen-X women dealing with three jobs, sick parents and now a missing Where’s Wally? outfit on Amazon Prime one-hour specified delivery, the evening before World Book Day.Karen, according to the meme, is ostensibly female and white – but is anyone these days above entering Deep Karen Mode? Has your Deliveroo dinner been left in a hedge? Did your Uber driver go awol then take his £6 for the trouble? Has your wifi been playing up for a week, and do the helpline staff seem unbothered? Can you feel a storm a-brewing? Is it time to use that special, sharp-elbowed voice? That voice so many of us learned from our mothers, usually in Marks \u0026amp Spencer in 1983, watching them return substandard items, without a receipt, powered only by solid, weapons-grade older-lady ire. Is it time to speak to the manager?Of course, long after the matter has been settled, a refund or an apology issued, I’m often reminded that nobody involved was a winner. We are all merely pawns in a bigger, complex game. Last week I did speak to the manager, who says my fridge is definitely coming next Tuesday and he will refund the cost of the previous non-delivery. I plan to stay in all day, channelling Zen-like empathy, listening to my Calm App, remembering that my item is being delivered at breakneck speed by a person who feasibly has a back injury from delivering fridges. Someone who may have worked till 10pm yesterday, and without holiday for months, and who may not arrive that day, if ever. Someone who is also a human being. My perishable goods may be wilting, but for now, I am staying chilled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d02fabe594d9a10c56cc359782c25c5a49d3695/0_196_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=782b597b27a857ebc9444c726f53c8ae","title":"late dad grief impounded skoda proxy grief bereaved","story":"If only the recently bereaved could be granted an amnesty from troublesome paperworkMy dead dad’s car has been impounded, and it is all my fault. I screwed up the admin, and now his much-loved 16-year-old Skoda Fabia faces obliteration. Given that I am the only child of two only children, both deceased, and that one of my 3am woodpecker threnodies of grief has been that my family has been wiped from the face of the Earth, I suppose that’s fitting enough.Mourning, as you see, can be melodramatic. Because, in fact, I am nested in another family, huge and hugely loving, have stalwart friends falling over themselves to help, and plenty of material and practical resources to face the obstacles before me. Checking my privilege would require a long and detailed stock-take.It doesn’t always feel like that in the early hours. Then, loss can seem like an isolation cell in which days, objects and sensations blur into one another in disorientating and befuddling fashion. A few hours that might have contained some productive work, a nice dinner, lipstick, chatter, red wine and the feeling that, “actually, it’s OK, I can do this”, abruptly recede and the mind is filled with the poetry of Sylvia Plath: “I am the centre of an atrocity.”But back to the Skoda. I had been driving it even when my dad was still alive, to and from the hospital, to the next-door Sainsbury’s for more pyjamas and tissues and soft jellies and – God almighty, the hubris – to buy a cheap tablet that I hoped he might recover enough to watch football and cricket on (he never did). When he died in March, I knew I couldn’t keep the car indefinitely I mostly live in rural Ireland and when I stay in London, have no real need for it. So I managed to pull off a self-deception – like all the best ones, with a grain of truth to it – and told myself it was useful to keep for now. For popping down to Dad’s flat, to clear it out, to ferry things to charity shops and friends, and (near-unbearable thought) to the rubbish dump.Except I couldn’t bear to do that quite yet either, and there it sat, the clock ticking as its motor tax ran out. And then, quite unexpectedly, there it didn’t sit.At first, I thought it had been stolen – presumably by joy riders who found it an easy mark, because who would want to nick a 16-year-old Skoda in a street filled with far smarter cars? I wandered up and down the road, thinking I must have forgotten where I had parked it (the amnesia of grief or menopause, take your pick). No dice. And so I reported it to the police, who, after a few days, responded that in the absence of any evidence, there was so little chance of finding it that they would not be pursuing the case.I put up a mild resistance: could it not have been picked up on CCTV? But unless I could narrow the time of its disappearance down to a 20-minute window, they countered, they didn’t have the resources to investigate. The end: and after some particularly vicious inner monologues (“You didn’t stop him dying, and you couldn’t even look after his car” “he loved that car, and you lost it”, “he kept a photograph of Mum on the dashboard”, and so forth), I moved on.So I was taken aback when a police officer called earlier this week. Your Skoda, he said. Not stolen, removed. No tax. Here’s the number to call.Actually, he gave me the wrong number, and in any case, it was the first of many people to call. The car pound, the DVLA, back to the police on some point of clarification. Never, ever, through to the right person on the first go a hell of automated menu options quite often a mere instruction to fill out a form.All my fault. I had an idea that the tax ran out at the end of June. But in fact it was the MOT that had expired during the car’s incarceration. The authorities had written to warn about the tax, and sent the letter to my dad’s flat. Yet you knew he was dead! I pleaded on the phone. But I had told the wrong department. OK, I said, but I’m in touch now. Can I pay the tax and get the car? Well, they said, of course you can. If you can pay the release fees and the storage charges that you had no idea you were racking up, which now exceed the car’s value by a significant margin.Be kind to yourself, people say when you’ve been bereaved. You’ll be very tired (I am shattered, save for weird bursts of manic energy). You’ll feel you should be getting on with things but you might not always be able to you mustn’t worry about that, it’s quite normal.But the people who say these kind things do not, sadly, make the rules. And the rules, even more sadly, do not stipulate that major life events deserve an amnesty in which you might be so focused on keeping your shit together that you will louse up the paperwork.How could they? For all I know, I was the hundredth person to ring up with a dead dad and a sob story that day. That mine is true is immaterial. And so, ultimately, is the little blue Skoda. He won’t need it again. After a few days of tears and general existential crisis, I’ve picked up a bit and rowed back on the self-pity. “You know all this pain’s about your dad, not the car,” said my partner, very gently. Yes. Yes, I do. But sometimes, it’s easier to think about the car.• Alex Clark is a writer for the  and Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31c869259940032011d4674f7dcd11019410ae1/275_143_1436_861/master/1436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bc5af9826de43d7cc88a96fa024d06e","title":"women on the verge of a cricket shakedown","story":"Being a cricketer and a woman is no easy path. Tasneem-Summer Khan meets a coach, an umpire, and a player inspiring girls and the game to come togetherYou won’t often hear cricket described as trailblazing it’s more commonly thought of as reactionary. However, spurred on by a summer of World Cup and Ashes cricket, women and girls all over Britain are making their mark on the sport.Asma Ajaz-Ali, a third-generation British Pakistani who grew up in inner-city Birmingham, experienced a variety of socioeconomic and cultural barriers to playing the game. Despite this lack of access to the formal game, she taught her brothers to play on an informal basis, then began running sessions for women and girls who had never before held a bat, supported by Warwickshire CC.“People think cricket is all upper middle-class men,” says Ajaz-Ali, who joined the ECB’s ambitious South Asian Action Plan, supported by NatWest, that aims to transform community engagement by recruiting 2,000 female mentors. “I go to mosques, temples, community centres, and get children and women from everywhere involved. Children see their mothers coaching and feel pride. It tells them they can do that too. These initiatives change opportunities and cultural attitudes for generations.”Ajaz-Ali prefers to focus on the future than lamenting her own lack of opportunity growing up. “I can’t bring back that time for me, but I can offer something to these girls,” she says. She sees change happening in the sport and aspires to generate more: “I have women playing in shalwar kameez, I coach asylum seekers. The point is to break down barriers and build inclusivity. Cricket is such a cool sport. It’s vibrant, it’s dynamic, and we have to try harder to make more people, particularly girls of all backgrounds, understand that.”Much like Ajaz-Ali, Laura Caughey found it hard to get a game of cricket. Growing up in Northern Ireland, she attempted to join a team as a child, only to be told she could practise with the boys but, lacking female peers, could not play in matches. “That stuck with me through adulthood and it’s not something I want more girls to experience.”Caughey decided to focus on a different aspect of the sport – umpiring. “I’d watch Simon Taufel and study what he did … he was my cricket idol growing up.” She became Ireland’s second female umpire this year when she was appointed to the representative panel of match officials.Through umpiring, Caughey has met like-minded people and helped to shape the conversation through administrative panels, eventually helping to set up and develop a women’s side at her local Carrickfergus CC. Reflecting on the enduring dismissive attitudes towards women in the sport, she says: “I just want to enjoy my season and let my on-field speak for me.”Ellie Threlkeld has been playing cricket for 10 years. She credits her experiences in mixed-gender cricket for developing skills which saw her move from the age-group county setup to playing for Lancashire Thunder in the semi-professional Kia Super League.Recognising the limited prospects for women cricketers, she opted to study psychology at Loughborough. The university’s enviable facilities and MCCU membership enable her to simultaneously develop her game and prepare for another option if cricket doesn’t work out.Threlkeld – who has ambitions to replace her England wicketkeeping heroes Sarah Taylor and Amy Jones one day – volunteers, coaches, and does ambassador work to grow interest and participation. “Assemblies get a great turnout, and girls can see how good it is to be a cricketer, but kids don’t just need role models – they need more thrown into the game so it’s an actual career.“A lot of women don’t have the option to train full-time – they need to work to earn a living. If there was money involved in the game, everything would improve faster.”With women all over the country dedicating their time and energy to the sport, barriers are shifting – new generations of girls are becoming women under the tutelage of these inspirational characters, and it’s hard to imagine anything but a positive future for British women’s cricket.For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels - from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

And Sones received reports from other researchers of similar mass mussel deaths at various beaches across roughly 140 miles of coastline.While the people who flocked to the Pacific to enjoy a rare 80F beach day soaked up the sun, so did the mussel beds – where the rock-bound mollusks could have been experiencing temperatures above 100F at low tide, literally roasting in their shells.Sones expects the die-off to affect the rest of the seashore ecosystem. “Mussels are known as a foundation species. The equivalent are the trees in a forest – they provide shelter and habitat for a lot of animals, so when you impact that core habitat it ripples throughout the rest of the system,” said Sones.“I would expect that this actually impacted the entire region, it’s just that you would have to have people out there to document it to know,” said Sones.Years of research into ocean health has focused on rising water temperatures and the effects of acidification on marine life. Kelp and coral are suffering in warmer waters, starfish are melting, and shellfish are breaking down.But there is less data on the impacts of these kinds of one-off extreme weather events in the open coastal air. The Northeastern University marine ecologist Brian Helmuth designed a robot mussel that can measure and log temperatures as the animal would experience them.“We no longer think of climate change in the future when we do this kind of forecasting work,” Helmuth told BayNature. “It’s how do you prepare for it now.”The University of British Columbia biologist Christopher Harley documented a mussel cook-off at Bodega Head in 2004, but he and Sones believe this one was probably bigger.“These events are definitely becoming more frequent, and more severe,” said Harley, citing diminishing mussel beds along the west coast, up to British Columbia. “Mussels are one of the canaries in the coal mine for climate change, only this canary provides food and habitat for hundreds of other species.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d49c18986d8c04f91c927c690118c1cf7c40bd2/698_367_6065_3641/master/6065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c74e2f853d5d25c0e8881d7f270da64","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez met greta thunberg hope contagious climate","story":"One is America’s youngest-ever congresswoman, the other a Swedish schoolgirl. Two of the most powerful voices on the climate speak for the first timeAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez enters a boardroom at her constituency office in Queens, New York, after a short delay which, a political aide hopes, hasn’t been caused by a constituent waylaying her in the corridor. (“They can get really excited to meet her.”) Greta Thunberg is in her home in Sweden, her father testing the technology for the video link while the teenager waits in the background. The activists have never met nor spoken but, as two of the most visible climate campaigners in the world, they are keenly aware of each other.Thunberg, now 16, catapulted to fame last year for skipping school every Friday to stand outside the Swedish parliament, protesting against political inaction over the climate crisis and sparking an international movement, the school strike for climate, in which millions of other children followed suit. Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic Representative for New York’s 14th congressional district is, at 29, the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, whose election over a well-funded incumbent in 2018 was a huge upset to politics-as-usual. She has been in office for less than a year, which seems extraordinary given the amount of coverage she has generated. In February, Ocasio-Cortez submitted the Green New Deal to the US House of Representatives, calling for, among other things, the achievement of “net-zero” greenhouse gases within a decade and “a full transition off fossil fuels”, as well as retrofitting all buildings in the US to meet new energy efficient standards.The Green New Deal, while garnering support from Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, was mocked by speaker Nancy Pelosi (“the green dream or whatever they call it”), and defeated in the Senate by Republicans. Like Thunberg, however, Ocasio-Cortez gives every appearance of being galvanised by opposition, and has the kind of energy that has won her 4.41 million Twitter followers and makes establishment politicians in her path very nervous.In the course of their conversation, Ocasio-Cortez and Thunberg discuss what it is like to be dismissed for their age, how depressed we should be about the future, and what tactics, as an activist, really work. Ocasio-Cortez speaks with her customary snap and brilliance that, held up against the general waffle of political discourse, seems startlingly direct. Thunberg, meanwhile, is phenomenally articulate, well-informed and self-assured, holding her own in conversation with an elected official nearly twice her age and speaking in deliberate, thoughtful English. They are, in some ways, as different as two campaigners can get – the politician working the system with Washington polish, and the teenager in her socks and leggings, working from her bedroom to reach the rest of the world. There is something very moving about the conversation between these young women, a sense of generational rise that, as we know from every precedent from the Renaissance onwards, has the power to ignite movements and change history.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez It’s such an honour to meet you!GT Thank you so much for standing up and offering hope to so many people, even here in Sweden.AOC One of the things I’m interested in hearing from you is that often people say, “Don’t politicise young people.” It’s almost a taboo. That to have someone as young as you coming out in favour of political positions is manipulative or wrong. I find it very condescending, as though, especially in this day and age with the access to information we have, you can’t form your own opinions and advocate for yourself. I’m interested in how you approach that – if anyone brings that up with you?GT That happens all the time. That’s basically all I hear. The most common criticism I get is that I’m being manipulated and you shouldn’t use children in political ways, because that is abuse, and I can’t think for myself and so on. And I think that is so annoying! I’m also allowed to have a say – why shouldn’t I be able to form my own opinion and try to change people’s minds?But I’m sure you hear that a lot, too that you’re too young and too inexperienced. When I see all the hate you receive for that, I honestly can’t believe how you manage to stay so strong.AOC I think the thing that people sometimes don’t realise is that here in the United States, because of the gap between the rich and the poor, people really identify Wall Street as a very potent political force. With our rules, politicians are allowed to accept campaign contributions on a level that is probably beyond what happens in other parts of the world.But what people don’t recognise is how strong the fossil fuel lobby is. The Koch brothers in the US have essentially purchased the entire Republican party, but people forget they made their money off oil and gas. That is where their fortune comes from. And I think that’s what we’re up against. So the severity of the pushback indicates the power that we are challenging. You can look at that with despair, or you can look at it with hope. That’s how strong we are: we’re so strong that we’re able to take this on credibly and actually build a movement against it.GT Yes, I mean, the oil lobby is huge in the US, and we also have that kind of lobby in Sweden. Not as much, but...AOC What is the most effective tactic in gaining attention for the environmental movement? What have you done, or what have been the practices that have been most galvanising?GT I think this whole movement in which I just sat down in front of the parliament, alone – I think that had a huge impact, because people saw it and were moved, and became emotional. Millions of children around the world, striking and saying, “Why should we study for a future that may not exist any more?” This is not only me, but everyone in the movement.GT Many people, especially in the US, see countries like Sweden or Norway or Finland as role models – we have such a clean energy sector, and so on. That may be true, but we are not role models. Sweden is one of the top 10 countries in the world when it comes to the highest ecological footprints, according to the WWF – if you count the consumer index, then we are among the worst per capita.In Sweden, the most common argument that we shouldn’t act is that we are such a small country with only 10 million inhabitants – we should focus more on helping other countries. That is so incredibly frustrating, because why should we argue about who or what needs to change first? Why not take the leading role?AOC We hear the same exact argument here. And this is the United States of America! People say, “Well, we should wait for China to do something.” There’s this political culture of people trying to say America First – that the US is the best nation in the world, yet at the same time they’re saying, “Well, China’s not doing it, why should we?”And I think it’s the same argument: are we going to choose to lead, or are we going to sit on our hands? It seems as if they take pride in leading on fracking, on being the number one in oil, in consumption, in single-use plastics. But they don’t seem to want to take pride in leading on the environment and leading for our children.GT Yes. I mean, countries like Sweden or the US, since we are rich countries, need to go first. Because people in poor countries need to be able to raise their standard of living. We have a duty to lead when we already have, basically, everything.It’s enormously easy to follow – it’s the easiest thing in the world. And there are detriments to following. You are too late. You do not control your destiny. You are not in control, period. You are often under the thumb of someone else. But it is enormously easy because you don’t have to determine the future. It seems as if, really, it’s a decision on whether we’re going to lead or not.GT Before I started school striking, I was like that. I was so depressed and I didn’t want to do anything, basically. But what I find encouraging is having all these people who are fighting on different sides in different ways, to create a better future and to make us avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.The school-striking children, when I see them – that is very hopeful. And also the fact that people are very unaware of the climate crisis. I mean, people aren’t continuing like this and not doing anything because they are evil, or because they don’t want to. We aren’t destroying the biosphere because we are selfish. We are doing it simply because we are unaware. I think that is very hopeful, because once we know, once we realise, then we change, then we act.AOC I had a similar tipping point, although it had more to do with income inequality. Many people know that several years ago I was working in a restaurant, and I had gone to college, and I had worked on so many things, but my family had fallen in to a lot of misfortune – my father had gotten sick and so on. And I was working in this restaurant and I would go, day in and day out, and I was so depressed. I felt so powerless, and as though there was nothing I could do that could effectively counter the enormous number of societal structures that are designed in the US to keep the working class poor, and to keep the rich, richer. I was really wallowing in despair for a while: what do I do? Is this my life? Just showing up, working, knowing that things are so difficult, then going home and doing it again. And I think what was profoundly liberating was engaging in my first action – when I went to Standing Rock, in the Dakotas, to fight against a fracking pipeline. It seemed impossible at the time. It was just normal people, showing up, just standing on the land to prevent this pipeline from going through. And it made me feel extremely powerful, even though we had nothing, materially – just the act of standing up to some of the most powerful corporations in the world.From there I learned that hope is not something that you have. Hope is something that you create, with your actions. Hope is something you have to manifest into the world, and once one person has hope, it can be contagious. Other people start acting in a way that has more hope.GT Yeah. I know so many people who feel hopeless, and they ask me, “What should I do?” And I say: “Act. Do something.” Because that is the best medicine against sadness and depression. I remember the first day I was school-striking outside the Swedish parliament, I felt so alone, because everyone went straight past, no one even looked at me. But at the same time I was hopeful.AOC It’s true that people don’t know when those small actions can manifest into something. I’ve seen it even in office. There’s so much cynicism about, how powerful can this be? Just me showing up?I think sometimes we’re so obsessed with measurement. What does me standing outside of parliament with a sign do? It doesn’t lower any carbon emissions immediately. It doesn’t change any laws directly. But what it does is make powerful people feel something, and people underestimate the power of that. It is becoming harder and harder for elected officials to look people in the eye.Just this morning I was sent a picture of an older gentleman from the midwest, which has just seen some catastrophic flooding – we’re starting to see flooding in the US where there was never flooding before. In the midwest there’s a disaster package that’s not getting passed, and he was just there with a sign saying, “Do you care about me?” He stood outside the congressional building, knowing that members are going to have to pass him by, and it’s very much inspired, I would say, by the actions that you’ve taken.GT I have a question. I have heard about how bad the situation is in the US with climate denialism, but I find it very hard to believe. It’s bad here in Sweden – but I have seen reports of how little the US media mentions the climate crisis and how it is treated. How bad is it really?AOC I would say that it has historically been very, very bad. But it’s actually getting much better.In the 1970s, ExxonMobil had internal science that not only definitively proved that climate change was real, but they themselves, the oil company, invested in modelling to see how bad it was going to be. Some of their models were so sophisticated that, back in the 70s, they were predicting our weather patterns as far out as 2012 – and many of them were accurate. They knew exactly what was happening.We have historically had an issue with media coverage of the climate crisis – I think they don’t realise that not covering it is just as bad as denying it. We have issues because much of our media is profit-driven, and if it doesn’t drive ratings they will not cover it as much. But we simply don’t have a choice. We have to do this.AOC Why do you think young people have been more powerful and persuasive on this issue, in particular?GT Many reasons, but I think the main one is that it is our future that is at risk. Most of us know that this is going to affect us in our lifetimes – it’s not just something that might happen in the future. It’s already here and it’s going to get worse, and many of us understand that this is going to make our lives much worse. And also that as young people, we aren’t as used to the system. We don’t say, “It’s always been like this, we can’t change anything.”AOC I’ve always said to people that youth is a mindset. And young people, we tend to come in and almost take that mindset for granted because as you said, we haven’t seen the world before, this is our first path, and so we have a tendency to question all of the nonsensical things that have just gone on for reasons of outdated logic. I have three- and four-year-old nieces and nephews, and they’re always asking, “Why, why, why, why?” For a lot of people it can be somewhat irritating. But I think sometimes it’s irritating because they don’t have the answers.You can be much older and still part of a youth movement, if you refuse to do things just because that’s the way they’ve always been done. I believe that young people just have a natural distillation of the world that is so pure. I’ve always felt that social movements, and youth movements in particular, should continue to be the moral compass that guides our vision.GT Yes, it always reminds me a lot of the Emperor’s New Clothes. Everyone believes in this lie, that only a child dares to question.I think the mere refusal to accept that can change our world. That’s exactly what you’ve done.GT I think we’ve both done that.Thunberg says that she is planning to travel to the US in August, so she can attend the UN Climate Action summit on 23 September.AOC That’s incredible. I’m so excited to follow that. Let us know how we can help from over here. I think one of the things that we need to start communicating is that this a global struggle, and it’s not about what is Sweden doing, and what is the US doing – it’s about what are all of us doing, as one movement? I think the power of that is very real. I wish you well, and I know many members of Congress who would be thrilled to meet you.GT Thank you so much.AOC Thank you so much, Greta. Be sure to let us know when you have an arrival date. If you land in New York, we will give you a Queens’ welcome!• This conversation appears in the ’s Weekend magazine and has been abridged for length.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3f1a354719f00192dc073638c61a9f8f340933b/0_113_5256_3154/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2de450bfa2be8d30ca177a741305cdef","title":"cows farts children climate questions answered","story":"What are young people most worried about? We put their queries to the expertsYou are obviously both smart and thoughtful kids, so I will be blunt and tell you that climate change is already causing big changes in our world. You can see this in the melting of the ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica, in the rising temperatures in cities around the world, in the changes in how much rain we get, and, perhaps most importantly, in the extinction of many plants and animals that are not able to adapt.One of the most important ideas to grasp about climate change is that it is not a future event: it is happening now, in real time, and those changes will only accelerate in the coming years and decades unless we radically reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere (mostly from burning fossil fuels). That’s why we must take action now.Are the changes we are seeing irreversible? That depends on how you think about it. For example, scientists know that ice sheets have come and gone many times in our planet’s history, driven mostly by slight wobbles in the Earth’s orbit that change the amount of sunlight hitting the planet (other factors, such as the eruption of volcanoes, have also played a role). So the ice sheets we are losing today will, in all likelihood, grow back some time in the distant future. But we’re talking millions of years.On the other hand, when a particular kind of frog becomes extinct because it cannot adapt to our rapidly warming world, it is lost for ever. We humans are pretty smart and capable creatures, so I don’t worry that we’ll figure out ways to adapt. And maybe we’ll even figure out ways to make it a better world.But it will be a whole lot easier – for us and for every living thing on the planet – if we take action now to minimise those changes, both today and in the future. I really like the world we live in, and I’m sure you do, too. It is a beautiful place. Let’s fight to keep it that way.• Jeff Goodell, author of The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, And The Remaking Of The Civilized WorldScientists have published a surprising amount of work relating to animal farts and our climate. It has been hypothesised that large dinosaurs (the sauropods) may have changed the Earth’s climate with their farts. Sharks are rarely seen farting. But like sheep and goats, cows are a type of ruminant – that is, they have four stomachs. This means a lot of methane, one of the gases that causes the worst warming. One cow can produce up to 200kg of methane a year. Most of it is released as burps, but some certainly escapes out of the rear end, too! Because humans eat so much beef and milk, there are an awful lot of cows in the world, and their burping and farting causes a sizable contribution to our greenhouse gas emissions, making up nearly a third of all emissions from agriculture, by some estimates. This certainly makes them a strong contender for the animal with the farts that do the most damage to the planet (even if their burps are worse).• Dani Rabaiotti, environmental scientist and co-author of True or Poo?, Quercus, £8.99Well, the good news is that nearly all politicians in this country accept that climate change is happening and that it’s caused by human activities almost all political parties have now accepted that we face a climate emergency. This is an amazing change from just a few years ago, and it’s happened because of people like the climate strikers.But declaring an emergency and being prepared to take the necessary steps to address it are not the same thing, and politicians – especially those in government – don’t match their words with actions. For example, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, was championing the expansion of Heathrow airport at exactly the same time as apparently agreeing that there’s a climate crisis – in spite of the fact that air travel is one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions.One of the problems is that most politicians won’t accept that we need a very different economic model, one that recognises that continuous growth isn’t possible on a planet with limited resources. We need to change our idea of what success looks like, so that instead of being obsessed by money, we measure human wellbeing and the health of our natural environment.There are also vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Too many powerful corporations benefit from the way things are now, and many give large donations to political parties, asking politicians to resist taking action. The good news is that ideas such as the Green New Deal are getting more support, as people recognise that investment in a green economy provides decent jobs and a better quality of life, as well as a more secure future. The role of young people in keeping up the pressure is vital – your generation is making a real difference. But we don’t have much time.• Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, was elected as the UK’s first Green MP in 2010People who don’t see climate change can be frustrating because the scientific facts are so clear. But, as you’ve probably discovered, facts don’t always help people see the reality. If anything, bombarding people with facts makes them more sceptical and argumentative. So, what else can you do? Here are three things.First, it’s really important to acknowledge the other person’s good nature, and to identify common ground and shared values – areas where you have agreement. Just because someone doesn’t believe in climate change, it doesn’t make them a bad person. You probably both care about things like family and other people. Affirming shared values reduces the feeling of being attacked being argumentative rarely succeeds.Second, invite people to think about their legacy – how their grandchildren and future generations will react to their actions (or inactions). If they are willing to acknowledge even a small chance that climate change is real, don’t they want to be on the right side of the argument?Finally, be really clear that climate change matters to you, that you are personally worried about it, and that you are asking them to help address it because you are scared. Friends, family and others are much more willing to help when they realise something is important to someone they love, even when they may disagree about the facts.Daisy Furmston and Chloe Nolan, both 14,  Hemel HempsteadThis is a great question. Think about your bathtub at home. Imagine the tub is the world’s atmosphere, the water is carbon dioxide, and the tap is running. If we leave it on, eventually the tub will overflow and cause great damage to the house. The same is true of emissions. If we continue to emit CO2 at the current rate, we are going to see catastrophic consequences.So, how do we solve this problem? The first and most obvious thing is to turn down the tap – ie reduce our emissions. The good news is, there are a number of great minds working on technological solutions – from renewable energy to electric vehicles – to do just that. However, the bathtub is still full of too much water – the air is already full of CO2 at dangerous levels – and if we cannot turn the tap off completely, the tub is going to overflow. So, we are also going to need to pull the plug – and that means removing CO2 directly from the atmosphere.This may sound impossible, but it isn’t. My company has developed a technology called direct air capture that removes CO2 using large fans to pull air through a filter that has a liquid capture chemical flowing over it. That chemical binds to the CO2, removing it from the air, and then we purify and compress it.After that, we can bury it permanently, injecting CO2 into rock formations deep underground. This means we create something called “negative emissions” by doing this, we will be able to bring our global emissions down to zero at a much faster rate. Eventually, these facilities will be key to reducing the level of CO2 in the air back to safe levels.• Steve Oldham, CEO of Carbon Engineering, a Canadian-based clean energy companyGood question. We always thought that the answer is that it would take many centuries, because climate science has generally assumed that levels of CO2 will remain in the atmosphere for a very long time: that global heating is essentially locked in. We are now seeing a real awakening, by scientists, organisations and activists about how to draw carbon down from the atmosphere. We can do this by using both natural techniques, such as planting more trees, and newer technologies that can filter CO2 from the air. So then the question is: can we reduce greenhouse gas emissions to very small and manageable levels, and remove significant amounts of carbon in time to avoid runaway climate change, which could occur within 10-12 years?Whatever the answer to that is, we must do everything we possibly can sooner than we think we can, and more brilliantly and imaginatively than we think possible. “Drawdown” is the name for the point when emissions peak and then begin to go down on a year-to-year basis. But even if we achieve this aim, most people think that there would be at least a 20-year lag time before temperatures start to measurably go down.There’s always the danger that if we take too long, warming will have increased to the point where melting ice emits methane, creating yet more temperature rises. The planet is then warming itself without humans doing anything to make it happen. In that case, all bets are off.• Paul Hawken is author of Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed To Reverse Global WarmingYou can be very powerful when it comes to action, as -: Greta Thunberg has showned the world the power of ordinary schoolkids. This is because climate breakdown will hurt younger generations the most, and you have done the least to cause it. Most adults realise this at some level, even though they aren’t doing much to stop climate breakdown, yet. Most of us recognise our moral obligation to leave children a decent future, which obviously includes a decent planet.The main thing ordinary schoolchildren should do is find ways for your voices to be heard, loud and clear. We need everyone to wake up and realise how serious this is. Climate striking every Friday is a great start. If you get in trouble with your school, it gives you a good reason to talk to the media: your voice gets louder. Because what’s more important – staying out of detention or having a livable planet? This takes courage, it’s true, but I think we find courage in ourselves when we have a great need. And there’s no greater need than stopping climate breakdown.Other things you can do include:1. Find groups of people who already understand the seriousness of climate breakdown, and get involved.2. Talk about climate breakdown with your friends, parents, teachers, the news media.3. Learn about it so you can answer questions.4. Try out creative new ways to express the urgency, beyond school striking.5. Reduce your own fossil fuel use. “Walking the talk” makes you authentic and empowered.• Peter Kalmus, climate scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Lab and author of Being The Change: Live Well And Spark A Climate RevolutionAllow me to start with a joke: If we don’t reduce emissions, the future will be like the film Waterworld – terrible.It’s important that we learn to laugh for two reasons. First, the climate crisis is here to stay, even if we do start to fix it soon. And humour can be a coping mechanism. It can help us deal with a problem that is so overwhelming it makes us feel small, depressed or futile. You have to laugh or you’ll cry, basically. We need to find ways to survive the grief and the loss of so many things we currently take for granted.Second, and perhaps more importantly, I believe that laughter is an excellent way of reaching wider audiences and engaging people who are less interested in the topic. Comedy makes people more open to new ideas. So humour can also be used to get the message across. Laughter has a strong social function in bonding groups of people together and also helps make the message more relatable.I know this because I’m both a climate researcher and a standup comedian. I do serious science stuff during the day, but then tell jokes about the climate at night. Talking about climate change using comedy helps me think about it in a different way, and to communicate in a simpler manner. I think more scientists should try it.And, just so you know, I fully support the school strikers. I’m just annoyed that they didn’t call it the minors’ strike.• Matt Winning’s show, It’s The End Of The World As We Know, is part of the Edinburgh festival fringe. His podcast, Operation Earth, airs this summerThere are many ways that we contribute to climate change through our daily activities, often without realising it. It can be interesting to do a personal greenhouse gas inventory. Do you eat a plant-rich diet, take short showers, walk, bike, or take public transport to school, buy used clothes, repair broken appliances, hang your clothes to dry, and avoid air travel? You can find carbon calculators on the internet that help you to work out the impact of your behaviours.However, the biggest thing that most of us do that contributes to climate change is to assume that what we do does not really matter. We underestimate our own capacity to contribute to a sustainable world. We tend, instead, to assume that things just have to be the way that they are.It’s easy to forget that you can inspire your friends, parents, school and community to try alternatives, such as providing vegetarian options, improving public transport options, investing in renewable energies, and so on. Or that you can also engage in politics, and work with others for climate justice and sustainability. The potential for each of us to contribute to a fair, sustainable and thriving world is huge. We don’t always realise it, but we matter more than we think.• Karen O’Brien, professor at the University of Oslo and co-founder of cchange.no, a website aiming to give people knowledge, skills, and tools to make ethical transformationWith thanks to Poole high school, Dorset St Bernard’s high school, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex John F Kennedy Catholic school, Hemel Hempstead, Herts, and the  Education Centre.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaec6a7f452233bff187d15e779c45a8b61b8c2f/312_103_4351_2612/master/4351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c72c50aa8901ad171808449597f1e8d","title":"mums ask when cows and their calves separated rise ethical milk vegan","story":"As vegan activism boosts awareness of animal welfare issues, more dairy farms let calves stay with their mothers. But is this really any better for the cows?A field of cows with suckling calves may sound like a normal rural scene. In fact, the view at David Finlay’s farm on the Dumfries and Galloway coast is a sight you’d be unlikely to see on any other dairy farm in the UK.Almost all calves are separated from cows within hours or days of birth on dairy farms. This allows farmers to sell the milk that the calves would otherwise drink.But it is a reality of dairy farming that jars with animal welfare campaigners and consumers, and one of the sector’s three biggest emotive issues, along with giving cows outdoor access and the killing of male calves straight after birth.“It’s the one thing we’ve always been asked about by mums on our farm tours,” says Finlay. “They just don’t like seeing calves separated from their mothers so soon.”The public reaction has led to a slow growth of a new sector, calling itself “ethical dairy farming”, where the calves are not removed immediately from their mothers. One expert estimates that around 400 dairy farms in Europe and Australia are trialling methods – varying widely from one farm to the next – for what is known as “calf at foot” systems. With a herd of 125 cows, Finlay’s farm near Castle Douglas in south-west Scotland is the largest known producer in Europe to introduce the calf at foot system. But the switch, now in its third year, has been far from easy.Finlay began the project in 2017 with the hope of proving such a method could work at a bigger scale. “The first year was disastrous,” he says, admitting that he wanted to call it quits. “We just couldn’t get the cows away from the calves and into the milking parlour. For weeks we’d be dragging the cows in there.“It took a long time for them to trust that the calves were still going to be there when they came back. It was so much stress as the cows just weren’t used to it and didn’t know what the rules were.”Finlay had to be talked into keeping the system going for another year by his family and other staff after his herdsman grew sceptical about the project and left, but by the second year the cows had begun to grow used to having their offspring around.The calves still need to be separated after weaning at around five months, a process Finlay and his new herdsman Charles Ellett have learned to manage by starting off with overnight periods of separation first.“That first day we don’t open the gates in the morning though there is a huge outcry from the calves and cows,” says Finlay, who has got round it by introducing a surrogate mother – usually an older cow not producing much milk. They then use this cow to lead all the calves into a field on the other side of the farm to settle them.The initial period of overnight separation helps create social bonds between the calves, says Finlay, making the final separation easier. The female calves will then stay on the farm to become milking cows, while the male calves are sold after five to seven months to produce veal.Leaving calves with their mothers has been found to reduce mortality rates and help them grow quicker by having all-day access to their mother’s milk, rather than a milk powder substitute. The suckling can also help protect cows against mastitis, one of the biggest disease risks facing dairy farming today. However, the suckling adds up to “crazy amounts of milk” lost to the farmer to sell, says Finlay. He estimates his losses at more than 2,000 litres per cow being taken by the calf, which equates to upwards of £500 in lost revenue based on the current UK average milk price. The cows also hold back fat for their calves when taken into the milking parlour, “giving us semi-skimmed milk”, jokes Finlay.But Finlay believes the model can work and that the improvement in the health and immune systems of the young calves will yield long-term idends that will compensate, to some extent, for loss of milk. And he has already seen a surge in interest in what he is doing from across the UK and overseas.Last year he raised more than £50,000 through a crowdfunding campaign to support the farm and its cheese production facilities. Conversely, vegan activism has also helped, he says. It is the loss in milk more than anything else that Finlay thinks will put off all but a niche group of dairy farmers from ever considering it unless they can secure a premium for the leftover milk. However, he is hopeful that consumer support for more ethical farming approaches will be boosted by activism.But other dairy farmers remain sceptical of the health and welfare benefits for the cows and calves – as well as the economics of making it viable. “It’s only ethical if you don’t know what the downsides are,” says National Farmers’ Union dairy board member Phil Latham, who runs a dairy farm in Cheshire and separates his calves at one week.“Yes, the calves get to spend more time with their mother, but there are a whole host of compromises with an increase in disease risk from the mixing of different age groups and a lack of control over the calf’s food intake. The longer you leave the calf on the cow, the bigger the stress when you do separate them.“It’s pandering to urban ignorance. If he can get a market premium from doing it and survive the milk losses then good luck to him, but it’s not about maximising welfare in my mind,” he says.Helen Browning, dairy farmer and CEO of the organic trade body the Soil Association, separates her calves and cows within 24 hours, but then keeps them with a surrogate mother cow who has been retired or rested from the dairy herd. Under organic standards, calves are separated from their mothers after birth, but are always kept in groups and must be given cow’s milk for their first 12 weeks.“Calves hate being weaned and cows hate their calves being taken away, whether after one day or five months. But it is better to do it before a bond has developed. In nature cows would live together as a family with cows and their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, so we are already interfering a lot with that family process,” she says.In terms of cow and calf health and welfare, farm vets say separation is not a priority. “If you really want to improve animal welfare then we should try to tackle lameness, calf mortality and ensuring the calf gets sufficient quantities of colostrum,” says Dr Kathryn Ellis, a farm animal vet at the University of Glasgow.Browning says dairy farmers are looking to learn from what Finlay is doing, but that the industry still needs to think through what is best for the welfare of both calves and cows being kept to produce milk. “We should think about what issue we’re trying to resolve. Is it an emotive issue or a welfare issue? I think it is the former.” Despite the scepticism, Von Keyserlingk estimates that more than 400 dairy farms are trialling calf at foot systems in Europe and Australia. Not far from Finlay’s farm in south-west Scotland, another dairy farmer keeping calves with their mothers has recently started selling his milk to consumers at £1.59 a pint.“This could be the norm in 20-30 years, just as tie-stalls were in the past. But it’s a fundamental change for how farms operate so we need to help farmers figure out how to make it better for the health and welfare of cows and calves and at the same time practical for farmers,” says von Keyserlingk.“To better support farmers in this transition, new research is needed on how these systems may be managed to function best for the cows and calves, including reducing the risk of currently common production diseases such as mastitis and lameness,” she adds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bb97ca99ff5c2f1ad3b85fef98d4db234512cb6/193_522_4891_2934/master/4891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21ac40635f99cd01fce42d9120852d2c","title":"plan to sell 50m meals electricity water air solar foods","story":"Solar Foods hopes wheat flour-like product will hit target in supermarkets within two yearsA Finnish company that makes food from electricity, water and air has said it plans to have 50m meals’ worth of its product sold in supermarkets within two years.Solar Foods is also working with the European Space Agency to supply astronauts on a mission to Mars after devising a method it says creates a protein-heavy product that looks and tastes like wheat flour at a cost of €5 (£4.50) per kilo.The Helsinki-based company, assisted by research from the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and the Lappeenranta University of Technology, will apply to the EU for a novel food licence later this year before starting commercial production in 2021.The powder known as Solein can be given texture through 3D printing, or added to dishes and food products as an ingredient.It is produced through a process similar to brewing beer. Living microbes are put in liquid and fed with carbon dioxide and hydrogen bubbles, which have been released from water through the application of electricity. The microbes create protein, which is then dried to make the powder.Dr Pasi Vainikka, the chief executive of the tech startup, said the company had produced a carbon-neutral way to produce a fully natural protein source without wasting land or water. Pre-engineering on a full-scale factory had just started, he added.“It is a completely new kind of food, a new kind of protein, different to all the food on the market today in how it is produced as it does not need agriculture or aquaculture,” he said.The foodstuff was said to mark a break with a thousand years of production. “If we go back in time in the gatherer societies we have just been using more of the same, plants and animals,” he said.Vainikka said he did not expect his product, which he described as the world’s most environmentally friendly protein, to challenge farmers in the next two decades but that it was a “new harvest for the people”. Three-quarters of the world’s calories originate from 12 plant and five animal species.Half of the world’s habitable land is used for farming and scientists claim the peak catch for the fishing industry, in terms of efficiency, was 20 years ago.Vainikka said the powder could be an “ingredient like any ingredient in the food” or it would be possible to “make the powder into fibres that resemble meat or bread”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12fefb65c9f8edf3f3ddf60de889cdbe2fd66734/0_0_1700_1133/master/1700.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f353d945ea473c5cc992bc50a82d69fb","title":"cant win without gays usa megan rapinoe","story":"• Coach Jill Ellis is unconcerned at Rapinoe speaking out• France’s Corrine Diacre will not quit after 2-1 defeatMegan Rapinoe showed no sign of stemming her outspoken ways after scoring the goals that saw USA march one step closer towards the World Cup final.“Go gays!” she said after the 2-1 quarter-final victory over France in Paris and when asked to comment on whether it being Pride month made her contribution more personally significant. “You can’t win a championship without gays on your team - it’s never been done before, ever. That’s science, right there!“I’m motivated by people who like me, who are fighting for the same things. I take more energy from that than from trying to prove anyone wrong. That’s draining on yourself. But for me, to be gay and fabulous, during Pride month at the World Cup, is nice.”Her latest comments follow the 33-year-old’s row with Donald Trump, after footage shot earlier this year emerged showing her saying: “I’m not going to the fucking White House,” when she was asked whether she would visit if her her team won the World Cup.She urged her USA teammates to “think hard” about associating themselves with Trump before the win over France, whilst apologising for using an obscenity, but repeating she would not visit the White House if the team won.Her White House comments thrust her into the president’s spotlight. This week he accused her on Twitter of disrespect and said she should “win first before she talks”. When the USA manager, Jill Ellis, was asked about whether she was worried her star forward’s comments would detract from her performance pre-match, she was emphatic: “No and, to be frank, I wasn’t aware until the press officer told me. That’s the head down approach I have.“I have not worried at all, she handled herself incredibly well at the presser the other day and you can hear her comments and expressed herself she is experienced and eloquent I would point to the performance today and say this stuff bounces off her and pushes her forward.”On the evening itself Rapinoe was thoughtful about the performance of the USA, who now face England in Tuesday’s semi-final. “We didn’t have the best night on the ball but defensively, the willingness and the discipline to do what we did was impressive,” she said. “We were ruthless in our chances. Moving on to the next round, that’s really all that matters.”For France another quarter-final defeat hurts. Their manager, Corrine Diacre, had said pre-match that: “We have had quarter final defeats haunting us for a while.” But, when asked whether this defeat was a failure for French football and whether she should depart, Diacre was clear. “I am not a person to give up,” she said.“We showed despite everything we weren’t too far off US I have never seen US switch to a five-man back line that early. It’s a sign.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269f9a41bd927ed31ee622062af8ad165b337f1b/368_96_1469_882/master/1469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=434699a38d84d7fd1e072bb72dc83562","title":"megan rapinoe amandine henry france usa womens world cup soccer","story":"While the American looked calm before Friday’s quarter-final, her French counterpart was grim-faced. That contrast continued on to the fieldAmandine Henry, the decorated France captain, came out of the locker room before Friday’s World Cup quarter-final with a serious look on her face. The furrow of her brow gave away her concern and, whether it was stress or merely steely determination, her teammates looked similarly grave.In contrast when Megan Rapinoe, the leader and tone-setter of the US team, walked out moments later, she looked like she was taking a leisurely stroll in the park. Her body language was loose, and she looked around, seemingly taking in the sights and sounds of a packed and raucous Parc de Princes. She casually chatted with teammate Alex Morgan, who was similarly relaxed.The pressure right from the first whistle seemed to be entirely on France, the hosts who were starting to see their nation fall in love with the women’s national team at long last. The French players had seemingly internalized the enormity of Friday’s blockbuster quarter-final and were playing like they had everything to lose.“Yes, there was pressure but was a good pressure because we have a lot of support with us,” Henry said after the game, which ended in a 2-1 defeat for her team. “But on the field, it was hard because they scored early. After that, to score against USA is difficult.”Indeed, it was Rapinoe who scored in less than five minutes to put the US ahead, which practically sealed USA’s win. After all, the US have never lost in a World Cup after scoring first. France have always lost after conceding first.Following her opening goal – which accidentally nutmegged Julie Ertz and Henry en route to the net – Rapinoe posed as if to say, “Ta-da! It’s me!” It was quintessential Rapinoe.She followed that up by pouncing on a deflected ball in the 65th minute for her second goal, without any French defenders tracking her run. Rapinoe joked that she almost had too much time to think about how to finish, but her strike was expertly placed. There was no second-guessing.Yet, it had been the sort of week that might drag other players down. Tweeter-in-chief Donald Trump criticized comments she made months ago about not wanting to visit the White House, making Rapinoe the latest target of the president’s most fervent supporters. And the dust-up happened ahead of what had been hyped as the biggest quarter-final game in Women’s World Cup history — “a total shitshow circus,” as Rapinoe had called it in the days leading up to the game.Not that the attention appeared to faze Rapinoe. She was unflappable this week taking questions from reporters about the Trump ordeal, and that cool carried over into the match. “I don’t really get energized by haters,” Rapinoe explained after the game. “I feel like there’s so many more people that love me so I’m like, ‘This is great!’ I’m more energized by that.”Indeed, her teammates and coach Jill Ellis have expressed nothing but support and admiration for Rapinoe. “Pinoe’s such a special person because people just gravitate to her,” midfielder Rose Lavelle said. “She’s such a fun, unique person off the field and it helps on the field – she’s someone people want to listen to and learn from. She’s helped carry us through the tournament.”With five goals, including a brace against both Spain and France, it’s plausible to argue that Rapinoe has been carrying the US team. The Americans looked at ease in the quarter-final, and there was no better embodiment of that feeling than Rapinoe. The majority of USA’s attacks were initiated down the left, Rapinoe’s side of the field. Crystal Dunn and Samantha Mewis kept feeding Rapinoe the ball. That wasn’t necessarily deliberate – Rapinoe was just in the zone. As defender Becky Sauerbrunn put it: “When a player’s on, you find that player more often that not.”Rapinoe wasn’t wearing the captain’s arm band on Friday, but no player has influenced the US this year more than the 33-year-old, who plays the way she seems to approach life: with flair, irreverence, and supreme confidence. Morgan afterward called her “the heart of the team.”France by comparison looked tense and stern coming into Friday’s clash. Later, as the game drifted away from them, they looked flustered and desperate. In the 78th minute, Henry fired a slow, skipping shot that USA goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher did well to smother, and the French captain winced.What makes Henry so exceptional as a captain is her intensity and physicality. She can do it all – score from distance, spray passes around the field or break up play with crunching tackles. But she and her teammates could never quite throw a poised US team off their game.Even though France eventually pulled a goal back, it never felt as if France were about to stage a complete comeback. “We have had quarter-final defeats haunting us for a while,” French coach Corrine Diacre said afterward.For the hosts, who now have failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics because of the Friday’s loss, the narrative continues. The pressure, the moment was too big for them. “We had never seen a full stadium,” Henry admitted. “It’s a path for the women’s sport and we have to continue to work.”For the US and Rapinoe though, it’s on to the semi-final round, and they too are aware of the stage they are on. “Everyone understands the gravity of the moment,” Rapinoe said. On Tuesday, we will see which one of England and the US handle that gravity best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94db4220ab43513b167afd449f9abb828b3ff973/0_960_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2248646fd29de6690548ade80d28132 220w","title":"a simple guide to finding the right travel insurance for you","story":"Travel insurance is hardly the most exciting holiday purchase, but it’s one of the most important. So, before you head off to warmer climes, check out this simple guide to holiday insurance to make sure you’re fully covered …Travel is said to broaden the mind, but for peace of mind it makes sense to secure the right travel insurance before you head off.According to Compare the Market, almost one in four people fail to take out travel insurance, leaving themselves at risk of returning home with a hefty bill should the worst happen – according to the Association of British Insurers, the average cancellation claim is £816, while the average medical claim is £1,300. Ouch!That’s not to say that the world of holiday insurance is easy breezy. With so many different policies on the market, narrowing down the right one for you can feel like an overwhelming chore.But fear not, travel fans – we’ve simplified the world of travel insurance to help you secure the right policy for your trip in a jiffy …Is travel insurance really necessary?Look, no one’s going to stop you from travelling without insurance, but it really wouldn’t be advised. We all head off in the hope that our trip will be all sunshine and poolside margaritas (well, some of us do!), but sadly not every trip is quite so blissful.Medical claims are one of the highest costs facing insurance companies. The NHS might treat us for free, but medical care in other parts of the world can come with a sizeable price tag, and some hospitals overseas may not even treat you unless they know you can pay for the care.So whether you fall ill, have a valuable item stolen or have to cut short or extend your trip due to an emergency, forking out for travel insurance could save you big bucks in the long-term.One size does not fit allTravel insurance is like a good suit – it’s got to be tailor-made. There are almost endless variables to consider from whether you want single trip or annual cover, to the number of people you want to include on the policy, and the activities and eventualities you want to insure against.Yes, finding the right travel insurance can be a tricky business. If you’re not sure where to start, Compare the Market is a good port of call. Not only can it provide you with an impartial and independent comparison of policies from a range of UK providers – based on your specific needs – in just a few clicks, but the travel insurance section of its website also has FAQs and helpful pointers (including sections specifically dedicated to different types of trip, such as golf holidays, backpacking and family trips) to help you narrow down your options.Read the small printAs with all insurance policies, when purchasing travel insurance, it’s really important that you READ THE SMALL PRINT! Check you’re happy with the excess (ie the amount you’ll have to pay towards any claim you make), ensure you’re definitely covered for all the activities you’re planning on doing, and double check you’re satisfied with the circumstances under which you’ll be able to make a claim.There is one more vital detail to check with travel insurance – how the country you’re visiting is classified geographically. Yes, you might think a country’s location is set in stone, but that’s not quite the case when it comes to travel insurance. Insurance providers group some countries differently for instance, while some classify Egypt and Turkey as Europe, others class them as “worldwide” destinations.Don’t leave your travel insurance to the last minuteIf you’re one of those people who gets their travel money at the airport, this point is probably for you! Smart shoppers bag their travel insurance as soon as they’ve booked their trip. Why? Because if your holiday is cancelled or delayed you should, depending on the terms of your precise policy, be able to claim for it – which ought to take some of the sting out of the situation.Head over to comparethemarket and get a travel insurance quote for your next trip.

But we can do more to bring the laws on marriage ceremonies up to date and to support couples in celebrating their commitment,” she said.The Law Commission published a report in December 2015 that raised concerns about the inconsistency of marriage laws, which have not faced wholesale reform since 1836.The justice secretary, David Gauke, said: “Whilst we will always preserve the dignity of marriage, people from all walks of life should be able to express their vows in a way that is meaningful to them.“This review will look at the red tape and outdated rules around weddings – making sure our laws are fit for modern life.”The Law Commission will consult with faith groups and other stakeholders, and produce recommendations in 2021.The announcement was first mooted by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, at the budget last autumn, but Downing Street has highlighted a series of policy reforms in recent days, as May tries to show she has a legacy beyond her Brexit travails.The initial Law Commission scoping review of wedding venues was commissioned by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, five years ago, and found that a wider choice could make marriage “both cheap and personal”.But the government’s response then was to warn that a review would throw up complex wider issues. In particular, there were concerns about providing equal treatment for religious and secular ceremonies.And the issue continued to be left on one side as the government was consumed with Brexit. The then justice secretary, Dominic Raab, said in September 2017: “Now is not the right time to develop options for reform to marriage law.”May has only now chosen to commission the next part of the reform process, as her three-year premiership draws to a close. “This review will look at how we can ensure marriage keeps pace with modern Britain,” she said.A wider range of venues is already available in Scotland. In England and Wales, the choice is governed by the Marriage Act 1949, which says the ceremony must take place in a narrow range of premises including a church or register office or an approved venue such as a hotel.The law could be changed to allow weddings to take place outdoors, or in temporary structures such as marquees – but a final decision to press ahead will be left to May’s successor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19fc3ed9a11f9c83a60551d5793f86ef340ea00d/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=297a2ded4d230f4c5260e2a75b015f5a","title":"blind date adam james","story":"What were you hoping for?A man with integrity, a great sense of fun, a passion for carbs, and loyalty, courage and honesty.First impressions?In the best possible way – an absolute sweetheart.

It was raining like mad. It has the precision of a military exercise, where you ask the very world of your squad but on the understanding that you’ve thought about where to dry their socks.All runners’ clubs claim to be mixed ability, but this genuinely was. One guy had done a 35km hill run the day before. Two sisters from the Jesus Christ Church of the Latter Day Saints were dressed like Zammo from Grange Hill dodging a PE lesson. Yes, I was smirking on the inside about nuns’ athleisure. I belonged in Bad Gym.We did a quick warmup in the street, during which we had to say our names and describe ourselves, which I did mendaciously (I like to chat, but I do not like to talk while running: I prefer to breathe). It was two kilometres down to the Kambala Cares community project.Ana Hancock, who runs the Wandsworth branch of Good Gym, sets quite a lively pace, but other-Anna at the back, with infinite patience, made this a shame-free experience. There was no way you could be slower than her she wouldn’t allow it. With a bit of messing about (wall sits, traffic lights), we got to the gardens in about 15 minutes.Donna, head of the community garden, was waiting with three friends and a shopping trolley full of shovels. And all these fevered enthusiasts arrived like a herd of wet antelope – there were 20 of us (sometimes there are 40). It felt very English and wholesome and a bit like a Carry On film, even before the fitness session where we all started chasing each other.The gardening took about half an hour, during which time 20 of us got a phenomenal amount done. “The funny thing is, I never do anything in my own garden, I wouldn’t know where to start,” one guy said. Same. But we must have planted 100 bulbs, cleared a terrace, weeded five beds. We learned running techniques in the park, then ran back, did a stretch.There’s a reason human societies organised themselves into groups: everything is faster and more pleasing. This is much more than a carbon-neutral wheeze to sidestep the soul-sapping disconnectedness of driving to a gym to run on a running machine. It is environmentally positive, from the smallest to the greatest degree.Good Gym is nationwide – 50 areas of the UK are covered so far.

The answer is in your hands. Feast is the ’s weekly cookbook and it’s packed with delicious recipes, whatever your tastes and kitchen skills. Flexitarian? Try courgette, ricotta and spinach dumplings with tomato sauce if you’re cutting down on meat. After a snacky brunch? We have toast toppings that upgrade your basic avocado. Need a summer dessert to wow guests? Let me recommend a very special strawberry and rhubarb custard tart.Launched last year with the tabloid Saturday paper, Feast brought together the paper’s peerless and much-loved cast of food writers in a new home. From Weekend magazine, revolutionary flavour magpie Yotam Ottolenghi, “new vegan” Meera Sodha, and Thomasina Miers, queen of the simple fix. From Cook, award-winning vegetarian cook Anna Jones and Italian kitchen diarist Rachel Roddy. From G2, Felicity Cloake with her “Perfect” experiments and Great British Bake Off’s Tamal Ray.The idea was simple: all their recipes would feature in one beautifully photographed, practical, collectable magazine, refreshed with drinks recommendations from Fiona Beckett and spiked with restaurant views by the brilliant Grace Dent, who rejoined the paper as restaurant critic. We’ve since introduced more cooks – sweet-toothed stuntman Liam Charles and eco-chef Tom Hunt – along with a run of great guests: Samin Nosrat, José Pizarro, Alastair Little, Sabrina Ghayour, Bosh!, Jack Monroe, Nieves Barragán Mohacho and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall to name just a few.We’ve done vegan, “cheat”, barbecue, picnic, Mexican, Moroccan, Italian, Middle Eastern, French and curry special issues. For our student extravaganza, Ottolenghi ingeniously devised a three-course meal based on two tins of chickpeas - our young readers and their parents gobbled it up.Some people say our recipes are time-consuming and use many hard-to-find ingredients. I loved the Daily Mash joke about the couple who spent eight days making a “quick, easy midweek supper” from the . OK, I did find myself blanching hazelnuts at 1am on a Sunday and I had to make my own olive tapenade because I couldn’t grab it locally – and I live in Clapham, south London, where you usually have a choice of pomegranate molasses – but that was just a fluke. Most large supermarkets and good grocers stock everything we use thanks to the Ottolenghi effect and there’s the internet if your spice rack needs an upgrade.When designing the magazine, the launch team thought about what, apart from the incredible roster of writers, would make it indispensable to home cooks. Stunning photography throughout, shot in our distinctive overhead, pared-down style. The recipes would fit on a page, so there would be no fumbling while following them. Before settling on the high-quality matt paper, I smeared olive oil, tahini and soy sauce over it to check it stayed legible. I hope it’s standing up to your miso, kimchi and yuzu stains, too.We were convinced readers would want to treasure their growing bundle of cookbooks so we made binders, which hold six months’ worth of issues, and are now available again via our online bookshop, having initially sold out in double quick time.But what makes Feast a keeper are the recipes themselves.  foodies are adventurous eaters and loyal readers. They trust our cooks to get it right and testing is key to this. Our superb food stylists make all the dishes for our shoots, and that’s when we get to hear which are the tastiest or, rarely, would benefit from a tweak.The reason our recipes typically work so well is that they get made many times before publication – anywhere from three to six times in Ottolenghi’s development kitchen, for example, before they go to his tester in Wales. Miers spends a day working on ideas with others, retesting dishes at home in the night “if it just doesn’t taste delicious enough”. Jones makes her dishes first time in her kitchen, then a professional tester tries them, then she makes them for the shoot because she does her own styling. Bakes often need more testing and adjusting because the chemistry is crucial: her custard tarts had “about 10 tests”. In her well-known Perfect series, Cloake tries six versions of a dish before combining the best of them in a definitive version. Many people wouldn’t dream of picking up an apron without checking if her huge archive includes their wish-dish.Of course there is an occasional hitch. When a filling doesn’t set or a mix splits, we hear from the readers’ editor. If we’ve left out something important, we’ll fix it online – like the time we omitted to say it’s best to prick aubergines before baking and two exploded inside a poor reader’s oven. Sorry, again.We love to hear from readers and help with your culinary dilemmas in our Kitchen Aide column. A sample of the challenges we’ve addressed: how to get kids to eat veg (any deviousness counts) how to make the perfect brownie the best ways to store cheese and to poach an egg and how to make meringue chewy and tofu tasty (fry it).A reader who can’t stomach chilli wrote to ask why we use it so much and what to replace it with. Chief culprits Sodha, Ottolenghi, Jones and Miers replied with loads of ideas (herbs, smoked garlic, pepper, lemon or just leave it out.)We’re also full of ideas about how to avoid throwing away food – or at least Tom Hunt is, in his zero-waste column. Don’t pour aquafaba (the gunky water in cans of beans) down the sink – turn it into meringues or mayonnaise instead. Put leftover lemon rind in a salad with capers. readers care about what they’re eating and its impact – especially when health, animal welfare and the environment overlap. The most-read food piece of 2018 on the was a Harvard professor’s claim that coconut oil is “pure poison”. The third was a piece by Bee Wilson about how bacon killing us, which won an award from the Guild of Food Writers just this week, along with our very own Grace Dent.Sustainability is a hot topic – ditch that almond milk, advised one piece. We aim to publish recipes for fish that gets a green light on the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide (the app’s handy for shopping). Like many people, we’re thinking about how much meat to eat. Recipes about chicken are always popular but our second most-read food article in 2018 was headlined: “Avoiding meat and dairy is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce your impact on Earth.”Overall, we’re publishing fewer meat recipes this year, but a lot of you aren’t giving up meat entirely any time soon. The most popular Perfect recipe published since 2017 is for boeuf bourguignon (although the second biggest is for roast cauliflower), and our most liked Instagram posts are generally hearty and carnivorous: Ottolenghi’s ribs and meatball traybake (although the biggest was Jones’s 30-minute brunch of poached eggs, polenta and asparagus, while a shot of Miguel Barclay’s £1 vegan potato arrabbiata was a huge hit). Whatever you eat, we have inspiration.

Almost half of those who chose not to switch said the process was too time-consuming, while a slightly lower number were put off by having to contact multiple providers.Under the new “text-to-switch” process, consumers text PAC to a number, after which the code is sent back. The code is valid for 30 days. The response from the provider will also need to include details of early termination charges or pay-as-you-go credit balances. The consumer can them pass the number on to their new provider. The service is switched within one working day.“The new process is designed to be quick and easy, so customers could request their code while looking for a new deal – for example, while on the phone to a new provider, or in store,” says Ofcom.Consumers have also sometimes encountered difficulties in paying both their old and their new provider at the same time when switching.From Monday, Ofcom will ban mobile providers from charging for notice periods running after the switch date. Ofcom estimates this will result in savings to the consumer of £10m a year.The move comes as part of a push by the regulator to make life easier for people dealing with their communications. Under the new rules, providers will have to publish clear guidance to help customers follow the new process, as a result making better switching decisions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3c36083327ebf49ed71e3ac2f68410e5b635267/0_109_5168_3100/master/5168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdcff66448baa54eaf7a7889a7cf8c8d","title":"pensions why self employed people should mind the gap","story":"A third of Britain’s self-employed have no provision for retirement – here’s how they can fix that There have never been more self-employed workers in the labour force, enjoying the flexibility and freedom this can bring. But many who work for themselves are at risk of an uncertain old age – or in some cases even poverty – because they are putting nothing aside for their retirement.When the priority is building your business, it is all too easy to push pensions aside. But the oversight could prove disastrous.Alarmingly, three in 10 self-employed people are saving nothing and have little or no safety net should they find themselves unable to work or if their business started to struggle. This is according to research by investment company Fidelity.Financial adviser Chris Wordsworth at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown says: “With no auto-enrolment into a pension scheme or compulsion to save as employees have, it is not surprising that this aspect of finances is so often overlooked by the self-employed.“The problem comes if you never get around to thinking about it. The longer you leave it, the less time you have to save and allow those savings to grow. The biggest message is to do something now, however small, and get into the habit of saving something each month.”The numbers of self-employed workers have soared in recent years. There were about 3.3 million in 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics, but this had grown to just under 5 million by the end of 2018. More people, particularly those with caring responsibilities at home, are choosing to work for themselves so they can be more flexible and have a better work-life balance.Among this growing cohort is 39-year-old Kirstie Broughton from Essex. She worked as an events manager for a City firm for 15 years before leaving to have her daughter Amelia, now 16 months old. She is in the process of setting up a business offering private antenatal classes and services. She hopes being self-employed will give her greater flexibility now she is a working mum.The business, Blossom and Bloom Baby Services, is in its infancy and, as she is not yet earning anything from it, she says she is unable to save in a pension. But like many others, this is something she worries about.“I can’t save right now as I’m still getting the business off the ground,” says Broughton.“It will take about five years to pay off the money I’ve used for training courses and the business set-up costs. But after that, all being well, I will look to start saving, possibly in an Isa to begin with.“I know pension saving is important – there just isn’t the cash in the budget at the moment.”Wordsworth says all self-employed workers should aim to have a decent personal cash reserve before they start any long-term or pension saving. “It’s important to have a pot of easy access savings to call on, particularly for those with a variable income, who may have lean months or times with less work coming in,” he says.With this in place, it is then advisable to look at different types of income protection insurance so you and your family are covered should the worst happen. Employees will typically have sick pay and other protection if they cannot work or are made redundant. By contrast, the self-employed do not, and any state help is likely to be minimal.Rebecca Robertson, an independent adviser with Evolution Financial Planning in Southend, Essex, says people should not be put off by the jargon. A Sipp is just a way of saving in long-term investment funds. “Of course, the main benefit of pension saving over Isas or other savings accounts is that you get the government’s tax boost on top of your own saving.”For example, if you put £80 into a pension and you are a basic-rate taxpayer, the government will boost this through tax relief to £100. Higher-rate taxpayers can claim further money back through tax relief in their annual tax return.One alternative might be the new lifetime Isa, which also pays a government bonus on long-term saving. But you must be under the age of 40 to be eligible.Robertson says: “There are lots of options and it can feel daunting. But there’s also help and advice out there if you need it. Now with digital or robo-advice, you can get good guidance about the best steps at a reasonable cost.“The worse thing is to do nothing out of fear or confusion.”If you have old occupational or personal pension plans, now might be the time to review how they fit into your wider retirement savings and whether they are in the best place. But tread with caution and seek expert independent advice. Many occupational schemes have hidden benefits, for example, or the transfer value will not represent good value for money, so you will need to weigh up your options.“Many self-employed people say they will sell their business, and that will fund their retirement,” Robertson says. “But this is a high-risk strategy. Some businesses could be difficult to sell, they may be worth less than you think, and the selling process can take many years. I am concerned if this is someone’s sole retirement savings plan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8317cf770cefe11fd131bf3492416051c31ac6f5/0_117_2979_1788/master/2979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=260daf4482918d8f1b94d819bada8ce3","title":"stormzy glastonbury review pyramid stage","story":"Pyramid StageNot only is this headline performance a show of supreme talent, it also underlines how Stormzy’s talent and charisma has pushed forward UK rapThe notion of Stormzy headlining the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury is an intriguing one. On the one hand, an artist who’s only released one album being elevated to such a rarefied status – up there with Jay-Z, Paul McCartney, U2 and the Rolling Stones – seems unprecedented. On the other, a persistent rumour around the site suggests that Stormzy’s show cost more to stage than any other in the festival’s history. That may or may not represent one of the histrionic myths that annually circulates around Worthy Farm – festival-goers with long enough memories to remember Glastonbury before the arrival of the internet and its fact-checking powers may recall the story that used to go around in the 90s that Cliff Richard had unexpectedly died. But watching Stormzy perform, you can believe it. His set opens with the kind of pyrotechnics that most acts would use to triumphantly conclude their performance and it doesn’t really let up from that point on.You could argue that constitutes an attempt to bedazzle anyone who doesn’t think the 25-year-old rapper has enough material to fill a headlining set, but his performance passes without the kind of lulls you might expect from an artist without years and years of hits to draw on. Bulking things up by wheeling out a cover of Shanks and Bigfoot’s UK garage chart-topper Sweet Like Chocolate proves an inspired move, likewise performing his remix of Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You.The sense of all stops being pulled out is hard to miss. If the first three songs pass with Stormzy onstage, with only his Union Jack vest, his DJ and an intense light show for company (the latter comes complete with a ticker tape that, instead of news events, shows the names of South London boroughs) that quickly changes. There’s a ballet interlude – designed to underline the fact that black ballet dancers now have shoes designed to match their skin tone – there’s a vast gospel choir, there are dancers, complete with a little kid busting moves, there are children on bikes popping wheelies as Stormzy performs Vossi Bop. There are also special guests: if Ed Sheeran can’t be there in person, then Chris Martin from Coldplay can, playing keyboards and harmonising on Blinded By Your Grace Pt 1.For all the eye-popping, OTT aspects of the show, there’s something very human and touching at its centre. When not imperiously rapping, Stormzy looks genuinely overwhelmed by the size of the crowd he’s drawn on what he describes as “the greatest night of my life”. Another guest, fellow rapper Dave, congratulates Stormzy at length on his achievements before leaving the stage, and, under the circumstances, it doesn’t feel like hyperbole. As Dave seems to suggest, Stormzy’s sheer charisma and talent have elevated an entire generation of black British music. Stormzy himself pays tribute to a string of new-school British rappers as varied as Little Simz, Not3s and Slowthai – and all of them would not be in such a strong position without Stormzy.As he performs Shut Up, the track that turned him from an underground figure to a mainstream phenomenon, or stands centre-stage amid an explosion of confetti with arms outstretched before launching into Big For Your Boots, Stormzy’s performance doesn’t feel just like a personal triumph so much as a victory lap for British rap: after decades as US rap’s poor relation, here it is, headlining the biggest music festival in the world in considerable style."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0b7cd86e3e7bda5ed22c75821e7ef99c498270/0_207_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a14cd8904226a1e646f99813b958d695","title":"ebola is back can it be contained podcast","story":"The current outbreak of the deadly virus in the DRC has been called the most complex public health emergency in history.

Riyadh has claimed the attack was a “rogue operation,” and has put several people on trial behind closed doors. But a report by a UN special rapporteur recently found that Khashoggi had been “the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible”.On the conflict in Yemen, the official said: “The PM reiterated the need to keep working on finding a political solution to end the conflict, which is causing significant humanitarian suffering.”UK arms exports to Saudi Arabia were ruled to be illegal by the court of appeal earlier this month because of the government’s failure to assess the potential humanitarian impact of the weapons’ use in Yemen.Delivering the judgment, Sir Terence Etherton, the master of the rolls, said ministers had “made no concluded assessments of whether the Saudi-led coalition had committed violations of international humanitarian law in the past, or during the Yemen conflict, and made no attempt to do so”.The UN has called the conflict in Yemen the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, estimating in February that 17,700 civilians had died, and 3.3 million people remained displaced.The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, has said the government will appeal against the ruling.May’s demeanour as she met the crown prince did not appear as frosty as it did when she met Vladimir Putin on Friday, when she upbraided him over the Salisbury poisoning, calling it a “truly despicable act”.May also told the Russian president she would continue to defend liberal values, after he gave an interview to the Financial Times in which he claimed liberalism was “obsolete” and made light of the poisoning of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b166ffe98dd00886fc125f9bf6e576c796d997ac/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33cadbdb8ea78828e57b76693c8e46aa","title":"labour to propose wellbeing law","story":"Plan would recognise NHS as ‘economic anchor’ and link health measures to climate goalsLabour is to push for a national law to ensure that new policy decisions are gauged against people’s future health and wellbeing, with an ambitious idea modelled on similar schemes already in place in Wales and New Zealand.The proposed Future Generations Wellbeing Act for England, to be unveiled on Saturday by the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, would mandate measures such as a “health equality audit” of all government decisions, and put a new duty on local health services to reduce health inequalities.Other elements of the proposed act, which the party plans to consult upon, would ensure health measures were linked to environmental and climate emergency goals, and to recognise the NHS as what is called an “economic anchor” in communities.In 2015, the Labour government in Wales introduced its own Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, which requires decisions to be measured against a range of long-term outcomes, including public health, the environment and social cohesion.While that law has faced criticism for a perceived lack of efficacy in challenging decisions, it was seen as playing a part in the Welsh government’s decision to scrap plans for a new section of the M4 motorway near Newport.In New Zealand, the Labour government of Jacinda Ardern said it would plan future national budgets around the concept of wellbeing. The first of these, published in late May, included billions of dollars for mental health services and child poverty as well as record investment in measures to tackle family violence.Ashworth, who will announce the plan for the new English law at the Fabian Society’s conference in London, said there was a broad background to the idea. “The context is all sort of things happening in health, like life expectancy going backwards, health inequalities getting wider, infant mortality rates getting worse for three years in a row. We basically need a new approach,” he said.“If you judge things by wellbeing it can lead to some pretty radical outcomes, or at least different ones to those you expect. It’s not just rhetorical. And we need something like this at a Westminster level.”In his speech, Ashworth was also due to announce a plan to commit almost £27m to a programme intended to help provide children in deprived areas with fresh fruit and vegetables.Ashworth was to say in his speech: “We will focus determinedly on improving the health and wellbeing of every child, ensuring children have access to nutritious food not just in schools but also by expanding Healthy Start. Labour will ensure the poorest children receive the milk, fruit and vegetables they need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

We’ve got an Antipodean set-to at Lord’s coming up later but we start with an all-Asian match-up that nine days ago didn’t look as if it would have much riding on it, and I suspected I’d be sat here trying to talk up nothingness to a listless audience of dozens. But then Pakistan cornered-tigered their way to steely wins over South Africa and New Zealand, England started imploding and now all eyes are on the new-look Headingley.Pakistan can smell a semi-final place, as a campaign that has veered as only a Pakistan campaign can between inept capitulation and ebullient dominance hots up. Most, though not all, of their batsmen have played their way into form, with Babar Azam in particular playing with exquisite technical excellence, while among the bowlers suddenly it’s a case of if Mohammad Amir doesn’t get you, Shaheen Afridi, Wahab Riaz or Shadab Khan probably will. They will leap with joyous abandon above England and into the top four with victory today.Alternatively, Pakistan could fall apart again, though they’d have to do so spectacularly against an Afghanistan side who are still winless and have not had the kind of breakthrough campaign they might have wished for. Sure, they’ve been natural underdogs and this drawn-out format has done them few favours, but off-field rancour, some poor batting and unreceptive pitches have made this all a bit of an ordeal. That said, they ran India closer than anyone else has – by some distance – and those spinners can be a handful for anyone. They have plenty to play for here.So, it might be scorching outside, but you wouldn’t want to stray too far from the cricket today. And nor would I.

It’s a coming-of-age musical set in a Catholic boarding school and focuses on the fear, doubt and passion in a gay relationship between two teenage boys. Jon Hartmere’s lyrics are dark and punchy and Damon Intrabartolo’s score rumbles with the turbulent energy of teenage life. Here’s a musical that should brim with personality and pertinence, but Julie Atherton’s haphazard production is simply underwhelming.The band sit on a balcony to the side of the stage and never really feel part of the action (the key changes come as a surprise to everyone). The actors perform on a raised stage with a thrust platform that splits the audience in two and makes it a nightmare to connect with the crowd below. A dodgy sound system blurs the lyrics and the superfluous activity at the edges of the stage – lots of mumbling and bluster from the ensemble – constantly distracts. Libby Watson’s design features a line of endlessly rotating lockers, and Stuart Rogers’ choreography involves an awful lot of spinning and thumping of chairs.There are tantalising flashes of what might have been, particularly with some strong solo numbers in the second half. Lizzie Emery nails her mournful ballad, All Grown Up, and Georgie Lovatt is a touching mix of fragility and defiance as the lonely and overweight Nadia. Stacy Francis shines as the wisecracking Sister Chantelle and her big number, God Don’t Make No Trash, is generous and wise a rare burst of feeling and purpose. It’s a blessed relief in an otherwise oddly muted show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8ed333b5889713e38830a966d084c5f4b77af23/0_3381_5504_3302/master/5504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f59f175736c7c464128448103f3f27","title":"jessica fostekey funniest things","story":"The actor, writer and standup on the things that make her laugh the mostI went to see Daniel Kitson in Edinburgh and that left me feeling like I’d had a spiritual experience.

Three creatives explain how their old man has inspired them throughout their livesThere are few experiences more bonding than sharing a drink with your dad. Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53451c2642c06f5eb483ce1ce163a6a71e0979c1/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f978fa4d4fa2f34f35c759b6b79a57","title":"journey of faith the guatemalan pastors helping smuggle people into the us","story":"As trusted iniduals in a Guatemalan culture rooted in religion, pastors and priests play a role in the booming business behind immigration Early in the morning, Antonio knelt before an altar with white candles and a small statue of the Virgin Mary and prayed for a miracle.It was still dark when he piled into a blue van with his six-year-old son, Gaspar, and a group of other farmers and their family members hoping to reach the United States. They set out from their home town in the highlands of Guatemala and rode for hours before pulling down a narrow dirt road which ended in a clearing near the Mexican border.The migrants bowed their head as their guide – an Evangelical pastor – cracked a Bible, and prayed for the group’s safe passage. At the border, he whispered a last “Que Dios te bendiga” (“May God bless you”) to each before passing them to the next handler.Guatemala is one of the biggest sources of migrants to the US, and across the highlands of this poor Central American country, churches and clergymen also play a role in the booming business of people-smuggling.As trusted iniduals in a deeply religious society, pastors and priests can offer comfort and a promise of safety to those undertaking the dangerous trek north. They also take a cut of the profits.Out of 23 towns Simón recently visited in the western highlands, he found cases of pastors and priests helping people to migrate in 14 of them.Some churchmen physically guide clients on the first leg of their journey – as with the pastor who led Antonio to the border – but most simply link up coyotes and potential clients. Evangelical leaders were more frequently involved in migration than Catholic priests, Simón found.As night fell in a small highland town 70 miles from the Mexican border, a few dozen people sang pop-inspired Christian music in a simple, single-room Evangelical church.In an office next door, drinking a Pepsi and catching up on his accounts, was Pedro, who recruits customers for a coyote.“Pastors can act as a bridge between people who want to migrate and people who can take them,” he explained. “They know the community.”At this church, three of the pastor’s brothers are well-known coyotes, according to Pedro and members of the congregation. For each customer he recruits, the pastor makes $250 he earns another $150 for praying with a group before they set out.After the service, Manuel, 19, a member of the congregation, said that the pastor had previously helped his brother travel to the US, where he now works on construction sites in North Carolina. “I know a lot of people who have traveled with this pastor. I would go, but I don’t have any money,” said Manuel. “But pastors typically know how to get you north.”While around half of Guatemala’s population is Catholic, in the last 25 years Pentacostal churches have grown increasingly important, and the country now has proportionately one of the largest Evangelical populations in Latin America.The movement first gained traction after the country’s first Evangelical leader, Efraín Ríos Montt – an army general and part-time lay preacher – seized power in a 1982 coup. The US-backed dictator gave weekly televised sermons – even as the military murdered, raped and disappeared thousands of indigenous Guatemalans in the country’s 36-year civil war.Catholic priests were often targeted in retaliation for their perceived sympathies with leftwing Liberation Theology. Some ordinary Guatemalans turned to Protestant churches in the hope of protection.Even after a peace deal signed in 1996, violence, corruption, racism and poverty have persisted.The Guatemalan state remains absent from many rural areas, and Evangelicalism has mushroomed as Pentecostal churches step in to provide public services, said Kevin Lewis O’Neill, a professor at the University of Toronto who studies Christianity in Guatemala.“Historically, there’s no reason to trust any institutions in Guatemala – other than the church. Evangelical churches in particular have been able to maintain trust by supporting these places with little state presence which live in the shadow of the war,” he explains.Pentecostal churches are omnipresent in the mostly indigenous regions where most of the country’s migrants are from.“Every Evangelical church is a moment of entrepreneurialism. You only need 10 families and you’re breaking even, if you take tithing seriously,” said O’Neill. “It’s a way to create a job out of nothing. It is also why there is so much competition in Guatemala – and why there are so many churches.”On top of tithes, pastors and priests can also make hundreds of dollars for each migrant they recruit, and further bonuses for praying with each group. Successful migrants will sometimes also send small remittances.In return, churchmen can recommend trustworthy coyotes who will safely help migrants through at least the first stage of their long journey north.In a dusty, drought-plagued town in the Huehuetenango department, Victor was recently working on a new second floor at the home of his brother, an evangelical pastor. The freshly-painted house stood out from the neighbouring homes made of wood and corrugated metal, and gave testament to his good fortunes.Coyotes sometimes use Christian messaging in their advertising, said Simón. One card handed out by a smuggler features a quotation from the book of Psalms – “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delighteth in his way” – emblazoned over a picture of a bus. Underneath, a caption reads: “If you need to travel to the United States have “FAITH,” trust in God and in the trip. We take: older people, minors, fathers and mothers with children.”And potential migrants sometimes turn to their pastors for advice when they are seeking a guide north.One recent evening a young woman called Dina, logged onto Facebook and messaged an evangelical pastor she knew. “I want to go to the US,” she wrote.He replied instantly: “I have contacts with some coyotes because when people leave for their trip I go to pray for them. I can recommend you to one and help you with prayer.“Come by on Tuesday to discuss.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13d6af01c3276c1381812f69deb169c405a5f25a/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9c7f7e118d1a23eb7ac80f9923cba23","title":"charity calls for total ban on tethering birds of prey","story":"Freedom for Animals calls on government to end ‘vastly cruel’ practice by zoosZoos around the country are routinely only allowing birds of prey to fly for a few minutes a day and keeping them in cages smaller than their wings, an investigation has found.A report by the anti-captivity charity Freedom for Animals, seen by the , details wild birds such as owls and falcons being tied to the ground on short leashes for long periods.Government guidance on tethering applies only to owls and vultures.Some of the birds can be seen continually attempting to fly away before being pulled back down by their tether and chewing at their leg straps in footage recorded by animal welfare campaigners at bird of prey zoos.The charity’s campaigns officer, Maddy Taylor, said: “Birds of prey used in falconry and held in zoos are still wild animals. They still have all their natural instincts and needs as those animals in the wild.“This includes being able to perform natural behaviours, arguably the most fundamental to them being flight.“Historically, there has been very little scrutiny of this industry and we feel that with the rising awareness around animal captivity, the time has come for this to be taken seriously.”Freedom for Animals is calling for the government to review the industry and ban the “vastly cruel” practice of tethering for all birds of prey.There are about 95 bird of prey zoos in the UK which house a minimum of 4,252 birds from 170 species. These include owls, falcons, vultures, buzzards and eagles.Though birds were housed in aviaries, in three-quarters of all zoos they were also tethered – often on lawns where the public could view them.Campaigners also witnessed owls being tied down at several zoos – despite government guidelines stating they should never be tethered. They claimed some birds were tied down for most of the day and night.While most zoos offer some form of flying display, during the investigation birds were flown for an average of 11 minutes, meaning some were tied down for most of the day.Emma Milne, a vet and author, said denying birds flight “and the chance to escape stressful situations and the choices that come with that is unacceptable on welfare grounds”.She added: “Simply put, birds do not belong in cages and this practice should be stopped.”Concerns were also raised by campaigners over “manning”, the common training practice of depriving birds of food until they respond to humans.“The practices of tethering and manning are outdated traditions within the bird of prey industry, practices which we believe do not meet modern animal welfare standards,” said Taylor.According to the report, a third of zoos also did not meet size standards for bird cages, with some birds living in such cramped conditions that they could not stretch out their wings.Under government guidance on modern zoo practice, aviary sizes “must reflect the flying capabilities of the species” and birds should “enjoy relative freedom of movement”.Of the zoos that did hold a licence under the Zoo Licensing Act 1981, an analysis of Defra inspection reports by the charity revealed several were overdue inspections.Taylor said the lack of regulation meant birds were left vulnerable. “How then can the law be upheld and more importantly the animals protected? The same species of bird in different establishments are receiving vastly different levels of monitoring of their welfare,” she added.Many aviaries were also found without clean drinking water, breaching animal welfare laws and guidelines. Guidance states that “every effort should be made” by zoos to ensure animals have access to water and are kept in a suitably hygienic environment.An RSPCA spokesperson said: “Birds should have the opportunity to fly when they choose and they should always have access to water and shelter, both from the weather and the public.“Birds of prey should not be handled by the public, a view which is supported by the Hawk Board, and zoo standards clearly state that no bird should be permanently tethered. Many zoos have free-flight aviaries for displaying birds, or are moving towards this method for housing birds of prey.” A Defra spokesperson said: “All captive birds are protected by law. It’s an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to a bird of prey and all zoos must provide a suitable environment for them to live in.“Where there is evidence that a bird of prey is being kept inappropriately in a zoo, it should be reported to the local authority which can investigate and, if necessary, initiate enforcement action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afa064c1f256d7d98b1038711fa84ae122ebd710/0_238_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a97d864a2660e3b89edcac1ea7bee3c5","title":"france on red alert as heatwave forecast to reach record 45c","story":"Record for mainland France falls in southern commune of Gallargues-le-Montueux as Europe swelters in heatwaveFrance recorded temperatures nearly two degrees higher than its previous record and firefighters continued to battle historic wildfires in Spain as much of western Europe remained in the grip of an extreme early-summer heatwave on Friday.The French state weather forecaster, Météo-France, said the temperature in Gallargues-le-Montueux in the Gard département hit 45.9C at 4.20pm on Friday.The previous 2003 record of 44.1C was beaten twice before on Friday: first when the southeastern town of Carpentras reached 44.3C, then hours later when Villevieille, in Provence, hit 45.1C.“This is historic,” a Météo-France meteorologist, Etienne Kapikian, said. “It’s the first time a temperature in excess of 45C has ever been recorded in France.”In Germany, the national DWD weather service said overall June temperatures were more than four degrees higher than historic averages for the month and 0.4C higher than the 2003 June average, the warmest since records began in 1881.The World Meteorological Organisation in Geneva said 2019 was now firmly on course to be among the world’s hottest ever years and that 2015-2019 would then become the hottest five-year period on record.While it was too soon to definitely attribute the Europe’s current blistering heatwave, which began on Monday, to climate change, it was “absolutely consistent” with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions, the UN agency said.“Heatwaves will become more intense, they will become more drawn out, they will become more extreme, they will start earlier and they will finish later,” the WMO spokeswoman, Clare Nullis, told journalists.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said extreme weather would become more frequent as a result of global warming. “We will need to change our set-up, our way of working, build differently,” he said, stressing a necessary “adaptation of society and its habits”.Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.\u0026nbspHotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change.Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.\u0026nbspAnother important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.When these waves stall, weather becomes fixed over regions and become extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.\u0026nbspMost of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record breaking cyclones hit Mozambique in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.Four administrative départements in France – Vaucluse, Gard, Hérault and Bouches-du-Rhône – were placed on red alert, signalling temperatures of “dangerous intensity” that are more typical of Saudi Arabia.About 4,000 schools were closed in France as head teachers warned they could not guarantee safe conditions, local authorities cancelled many end-of-school-year carnivals, and nursing homes equipped the elderly with hydration sensors.“This heat wave is exceptional by its intensity and how early it is,” the prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said, defending authorities’ efforts to avoid a repeat of the notorious 2003 heatwave which caused 15,000 premature deaths.“I want to appeal to the sense of responsibility of citizens - there are avoidable deaths in every heatwave,” Philippe said. “Measures have been taken for the most vulnerable people but given the intensity of the heat wave, it’s the entire population who must be careful today ... both for oneself and for loved ones and neighbours.”The French health minister, Agnès Buzyn, warned people tempted to plunge into cold water to do so only in designated public bathing areas, adding that four people had drowned since the beginning of the week.A six-year-old child was also in life-threatening condition after being hit by water shooting from an illegally opened fire hydrant in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, French media reported.French families with elderly relatives who were ill or living alone were advised to call or visit them twice a day and take them to cool places, while the state-run rail operator SNCF offered free cancellations or exchanges on long-distance trips.The greater Paris region, Ile de France, had already banned more than half of cars from its roads in an effort to reduce air pollution and the cities of Lyon, Strasbourg and Marseille have also restricted traffic.With temperatures in parts of Spain expected to hit a new June record of 43C, the Spanish meteorological office issued red alerts in parts of Catalonia, Navarre and the Basque country.Hundreds of firefighters in Catalonia continued to battle to bring a large wildfire under control which has so far burned through 6,500 hectares of land and could consume as many as 20,000ha.A 17-year-old Spanish boy died from heatstroke in the early hours of Friday after having convulsions when he jumped into a swimming pool to cool down, while an 80-year-old man died on Thursday after collapsing from what is thought to have been heatstroke in the city of Valladolid.Italy put 16 cities under alerts for high temperatures, and civil security services distributed water to tourists visiting famed sites around Rome under a scorching sun and in Berlin, a police unit turned water cannon usually used against rioters on city trees to cool them down.As Germans attempted to cool off amid scorching temperatures, at least four people died in bathing accidents in different parts of the country on Wednesday. Parts of Britain were expected to experience high temperatures on Saturday, with a high of 32C forecast for London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e28d387c5b7321d83dcfac3d4661a309d1a2618/61_0_968_581/master/968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a04a2f18a2cb0de226c2b2d85e498a81","title":"russia first batch of trapped whales released","story":"Greenpeace criticises long-awaited operation, saying it risked trauma or death for the animalsRussia’s long-awaited operation to release the first batch of whales held in cramped enclosures in the country’s far-east region was dangerously flawed, environmentalists have said.The animals – 11 orcas and 87 beluga whales – have been held in captivity in a bay near the port city of Nakhodka since last year. They were due to be sold to Chinese oceanariums, before images of the animals languishing in the “whale prison” caused an international outcry.Vladimir Putin last week hailed Russia’s moves to return the whales to the wild. However, Greenpeace Russia said the two orcas and six beluga whales were simply dumped into the Sea of Okhotsk on Thursday after being transported 1,100 miles by truck and then boat to their natural habitat. The journey took seven days and the whales were held in small containers the entire time.The decision to free the animals came after a visit to their pens in April by Jean-Michel Cousteau, an oceanographer and son of the late marine expert Jacques Cousteau. Yet despite promises by Russian officials that Cousteau’s team of maritime experts would be involved in their release, no international or independent scientists were invited to take part. Cousteau had recommended that the whales be transported only by sea.Greenpeace said no attempt was made to prepare the whales for their return to the wild, seriously raising the risk of trauma or death for the animals. It also said that the entire operation was carried out in secrecy.Russian officials said the operation had been successful, and that none of the whales suffered during the journey. Nine orcas and 81 beluga whales remain in captivity. They will be freed in batches over the next four months.A court in Russia’s far east this month ordered a number of companies to pay fines totaling 150.2m roubles (£1.8m) for their roles in the “whale prison”. But according to documents published on Russia’s state procurement website, the same companies were also hired by the state fisheries and oceanography institute to release the whales. They stand to earn more than 360m roubles in total."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97f64e290a4e0a855c1e5bd86edb41d0f1a555ee/0_0_2587_1552/master/2587.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e22d39b721cbf1e703914a4f754f8933","title":"theresa may pledge make uk aid spending eco friendly g20","story":"Prime minister will tell G20 leaders they are last generation that can limit global warmingTheresa May is to pledge that Britain’s aid budget will in future be spent in a more environmentally sustainable way and tell her G20 counterparts: “We are the last generation of leaders with the power to limit global warming.”The prime minister has been keen to burnish her green credentials as she enters in her final days in office. Fresh from announcing a new target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – in the face of scepticism from the chancellor, Philip Hammond – May will lead a session on the climate emergency at the summit in Japan.She will promise that in future, the £14bn overseas aid budget will be spent in a way that contributes to the transition to a low-carbon global economy, and will urge other countries to adopt more ambitious emissions targets.“The facts, which are clear, should guide us,” she will tell her fellow world leaders, including Donald Trump, who has denied many climate science findings. “We are running out of time to act. We need a fivefold increase on existing 2030 commitments to remain below 1.5 degrees of warming.“In addition to stronger national commitments, we need determined implementation, and a change in how we invest. And we need to build resilience, both in our own societies and economies, and in the most vulnerable countries. I urge everyone here to push for ambition and consider setting their own net zero targets.”En route to Osaka, May said she had been inspired to take more action to tackle the climate crisis in part by noticing the changes in the environment on her Swiss walking holidays with her husband, Philip.Formed in 1999, the G20 is a group featuring 19 of the world\u0027s largest economic powers and the European Union. It was formed in the wake of financial crises in the late 90s, with a view to providing some governance for the global economy. Since 2008 it has held an annual leaders\u0027 summit.As well as the 19 countries plus the EU, also attending the meetings are representatives of several permanent guests, including the African Union, International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations and the World Trade Organization.Critics argue that it is too exclusive, and the format locks a significant number of large countries out of high-level discussions on the global economy.“Philip and I go walking, not just in Wales but also in Switzerland, and there’s a particular place we go to where over the last decade you can see the glacier retreating quickly – and this has brought home to me the importance of climate change,” she said.On Saturday, May will also reiterate the government’s offer to host COP26, the next UN climate summit. The talks are due to be held in November 2020, but no venue has been confirmed, with the UK making a joint bid with the Italian government. The summit is expected to be attended by about 30,000 delegates, including up to 150 world leaders. Turkey is also bidding to host it.In reshaping its aid spending, Britain will be following the lead of multilateral donors in placing more emphasis on tackling the climate emergency. The World Bank recently announced it would spend $50bn (£39bn) over the next five years on helping developing countries to adapt to the climate crisis.Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of the charity WaterAid, said: “It is encouraging to see the UK government recognise that all investment must be resilient against the growing number of severe droughts, flooding and storms that threaten health and livelihoods.“The poorest communities are being hit hardest by climate change and they are paying for it increasingly through negative impacts on clean and safe water supplies. These communities are the least resilient to climate events and must be prioritised. Without this, the significant development gains made over the last few decades will be rolled back, leaving hundreds of millions more people without the basic services of clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene.”Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “These commitments are good in the abstract sense, but the test is always in the delivery. When talk turns to infrastructure you have to question the government further, when they start saying ‘green this and green that’ they usually mean gas. There is just no room for further fossil fuel extraction anywhere in the world in a strategy compatible with stopping climate breakdown.”May’s most likely successor, Boris Johnson, has previously questioned the existence of the climate crisis. As recently as 2015, he said: “Global leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity and that fear – as far as I understand the science – is equally without foundation.”In another last-minute commitment before she leaves Downing Street, after promises on mental health and housing, May will announce that the UK will allocate £1.4bn of Britain’s aid budget over the next three years to the Global Fund to fight HIVAids, TB and malaria.The Global Fund is a collaboration between governments, charities and the private sector that invests in projects in more than 100 countries.“We need urgent international action and a truly collective response if we are to tackle threats to global health security, prevent infections spreading across borders, and halt the continued spread of deadly diseases,” May is expected to say.Bill Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said: “Infections and deaths from diseases like Aids, tuberculosis, malaria, rotavirus and pneumonia have declined more than anyone thought possible 20 years ago. Much of this progress is owed to the funding and health products provided by organisations like the Global Fund, which the UK helped create, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.“But the job is not yet finished, and continued progress is not guaranteed. Today’s commitment by the people of the UK via the Global Fund is a positive step forward in the global fight against these diseases, and will help to save millions of lives.”“I know that people say we shouldn’t be spending so much on overseas aid,” he said. “I think some of it probably could be much, much better spent, spent delivering British commercial and political objectives, but it delivers massive results around the world, and we should be very, very proud of the good the UK does.“I think it would be a very sad day if we were being seen to retreat from our global engagement. That is not what Brexit is about, is it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54c12412b9f232f8af5656e264b6c8a57a014bf/0_374_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7e5673f409971520d0df7542c547ba9","title":"world powers iran nuclear deal abandoned us","story":"Expectations are not being met in discussions with world powers, claims Iranian envoyIran said some progress had been made at a meeting with world powers on its nuclear accord – but probably “still not enough” to keep the landmark 2015 deal alive.“It was a step forward, but it is still not enough and not meeting Iran’s expectations,” said Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, after the talks on Friday. “I don’t think the progress made today will be enough to stop our process – but the decision will be made in Tehran.”Tehran has threatened to withdraw from key commitments in the deal, probably on 7 July, a move that might force European powers to reluctantly join the US and quit the deal signed in 2015.Araghchi said: “The decision to reduce our commitments has already been made in Iran and we continue on that process unless our expectations are met.”But he also said a ministerial-level meeting would be held soon, probably giving Europe a further chance to save the deal from imminent collapse.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Such a collapse would probably lead the EU to join the US in imposing sanctions, which might bring a military response by Iran as it tries to find levers to force the west to loosen the vice on its economy.At the talks, the three European powers – France, Germany and the UK – tried to assuage Iranian doubts that Europe was sticking to its side of the 2015 bargain by pressing ahead with the long-planned mechanism to facilitate trade between Iran and Europe without being hit by US sanctions.The lead EU negotiator, Helga Schmid, hailed the discussions as constructive and said the first transactions had been completed through the mechanism, known as Instex.The EU was also due to supply a modest €3m (£2.7m) credit line to kickstart the mechanism as a signal of good intent.However, Araghchi said: “For Instex to be useful for Iran, Europeans need to buy oil or consider credit lines for this mechanism, otherwise Instex is not like they or us expect.”The EU has always said Instex will be confined to easing trade in humanitarian goods, such as food and medicine – a form of trading the White House says is not subject to its sanctions regime. Iran had billed the Vienna meeting as the last chance to salvage the deal.The Chinese envoy, Fu Cong, said Beijing rejected the US policy of unilateral sanctions, suggesting China may be willing to defy the US threat.But the US special representative on Iran, Brian Hook, insisted the US would put sanctions on all Iranian oil exports. “We will sanction any illicit purchases of Iranian crude oil. There are right now no oil waivers in place,” he said.Hook said the US economic grip on Iran was intended to force Tehran to renegotiate the original nuclear deal, turning it into a binding international treaty that also covers wider issues including Iran’s ballistic missile programme, its regional interference and its treatment of dual national prisoners.He also promised the US would go ahead with plans to impose sanctions on Iran’s chief diplomat, Javad Zarif. He said Iran’s goal was to bring the Middle East under the thrall of Tehran’s “Marxist theocratic” ideology.Hook was in London to urge the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a UN body, to back his plan for a UN-endorsed maritime protection force, modelled on an established UN anti-piracy force off the coast of Somalia.He said Iran, by its threats to Gulf shipping, was “courting a financial and environment disaster”, and was breaching all maritime rules by turning off its ship collision avoidance transponders in an attempt to smuggle oil out of Iran and avoid being tracked by the US.“An outlaw regime is violating basic maritime law and now represents a maritime threat across the Gulf,” Hook said after meeting the IMO secretary general, Kitack Lim.Hook went further than before by accusing Iran of planning to gain a stranglehold on all international oil-related shipping by controlling not just the Gulf of Oman, off the Iranian coast, but also the Red Sea shipping lanes through the Bab al-Mandab strait off Yemen that take oil into the Arabian Sea and on to Asia.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst \u0027chokepoint\u0027In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.His claim shows the extent to which the US regards defeat of the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen as integral to the wider defeat of Iran. “If we do not prevent Iranians from laying down deep roots in Yemen, they will be in a position to threaten to close the strait of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab,” Hook said. “They are seeking to do in Yemen what they succeeded to do in Lebanon. They would like to ‘Lebanonise’ Yemen and become a power broker on the Saudi southern border and to be in a position to harass the Emiratis and Saudis, and to be another threat in their threat matrix to freedom of navigation. We are pushing back on Iran’s long game in Yemen.”The sanctions, hailed by Hook as unprecedented, have so far cut Iranian oil exports to 400,000 barrels a day, levels that have put the Iranian government deep into debt.“This is a clerical regime that wants to remake the Middle East in its image – and that would deeply destabilise the Middle East to have regimes following the same Marxist theocratic regime,” Hook said.Describing the state of tension in the region, he said Iran’s goal “is to scare the global oil market to keep the price up and to keep the world on edge”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f064b3703903574e64549e2ead50d49449d05ea/599_85_3285_1971/master/3285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58202e99d290a940270b866dae603458","title":"nigeria cattle raising fulani tribe in pictures","story":"With over 200 million people and an emerging middle class, Nigeria is witnessing a boom in demand for meat.

Photograph: Angeles VisdomineExtreme heatwaves causing risk to life, such as those under way in Europe, will become more frequent as the effects of climate change gather pace this century, leading climate scientists have said.Prof John Sweeney, a climatologist and emeritus professor of geography in Maynooth University, said that shifts in mean temperatures will give rise to higher temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events in the near future.“You get a disproportionate response in terms of extreme high temperatures from a small shift in the mean,” he said, adding that the frequency of events was increasing, a sign that climate change was taking effect. “Heat records are being broken globally five times faster than they were a decade or two ago,” he said. “If you take the five hottest summers in Europe since the year 1500, they’ve all occurred since the turn of the century. There’s not much doubt the frequency and intensity is increasing.”Spanish PlumeThe heatwave under way in Europe has led to emergency conditions being declared in many parts of the continent as warm air from north Africa and Spain flows north in what is called the Spanish Plume. A new heat record was recorded in France of 45.9 degrees. There was a red alert for heat in Spain with temperatures over 40 degrees in much of the north of the country and wildfires raged in Catalonia. Fifty-one stations recorded new June temperature records in Germany, including 38.6 degrees in Berlin. The World Meteorological Organisation said this year was on track to be among the hottest ever and that would make 2015-2019 the world’s hottest five-year period on record. It said the unusually early heatwave in Europe was “just the latest in a series of extreme weather events”. Adapting to changeProf Sweeney said “the first thing to realise is that the kind of summer we are having in continental Europe at the moment is likely to be the norm by the mid to end of this century. We have to make plans to adapt to those changes.” He said: “We are loading the dice. We are making events like this happen more frequently than they did in the past.“Something that happens once every 50 years will happen once every 10 years.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fiscal and legal obstacles must be overcome to allow global access to presidential voteHospitals relying on junior doctors, as untrained \u0026lsquoconsultants\u0026rsquo threaten patient safetyReview says hospitals\u0026rsquo reliance on \u0026lsquotransient\u0026rsquo foreign doctors has created instabilityCSO data supports views of historians that Protestants benefit from \u0026lsquothriftier\u0026rsquo lifestylesPilot was on his way to attend a family birthday party when he crash landedTaoiseach says FG investigation into swing fall compensation claim is \u0026lsquonot a public inquiry\u0026rsquoFrance hits record 45.9 degrees as heatwave leads to emergency conditions across EuropeGarda\u0026iacute say they are investigating incident involving 14-year-old near TermonfeckinPeter McVerry Trust finds temporary house in Co Offaly for couple with seven childrenJudge thanks jury for their diligence in trying \u0026lsquodifficult\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquounusual\u0026rsquo caseBritish and Poles dominate among 670 people taking part in conferring ceremonyMinister says it will be months before benefit of July 1st changes are felt in housing crisisGreyhound board approves measures to improve welfare of dogs after RT\u0026Eacute expos\u0026eacuteTributes for \u0026lsquofearless\u0026rsquo advocate for victims of republican violence during the TroublesLE Eithne and LE Orla decommissioned until staff and retention better, says commodoreTomasz Paszkiewicz (39) has admitted killing Marek Swider but denies murder chargeTook part in first successful Irish expedition to Everest in 1993President Higgins says there was \u0026lsquosomething singular\u0026rsquo about the SDLP co-founder\u0026rsquos courage"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3940833.1561759578!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord healy raes show the true meaning of party politics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJackie Healy-Rae outside the Dáil. File photograph: Peter ThursfieldThe Healy-Raes made a right day of it in Leinster House on Wednesday when the time finally came for official expressions of sympathy in the Dáil on the passing of former TD and Kerry dynasty founder Jackie Healy-Rae.Hordes of supporters from the family’s organisation descended to mark the occasion, and joint figureheads Michael and Danny laid on drinks for them in the bar and booked out most of the Members’ Restaurant for a lunch in their father’s honour.A collection of more cowed, put-upon, impoverished, undernourished, overlooked and downtrodden people you never saw in your life. Representatives of the men and women who, more than anyone else in the country, are sick, sore, frightened, short-changed, persecuted, misunderstood and blackguarded on a routine basis by Them Above in Dublin and Beyond in Cork, according to the Healy-Raes in their regular bulletins to the chamber on behalf of the people of Kerry.All considered, they seem to be bearing up very well. The very pleasant and engaging crowd looked full of the joys of spring despite having to endure the many privations faithfully reported in detail to the Dáil by their loyal servants, the Healy-Raes. There was great gas all day in the bar, the sing-songs gloriously breaking the rules and Danny a wizard with the concertina buttons.As the guests – more than 100 – moved from bar to restaurant, a Healy-Rae activist decided to nab selfies with every TD and Senator she recognised along the way. One of them was Bríd Smith of People Before Profit, who was making very slow progress on crutches having banjaxed her leg while walking in Spain during the recent break.“I know you,” said the woman. “What happened to you?”And Bríd came out with the answer she gave to everyone who inquired. “I fell off a swing with a drink in both hands.”The woman was overjoyed. “Oh my God! ’Tis you?” she cried. “Is that really you? Do you mind if I get a photograph?”Back in the chamber, the Taoiseach’s opening speech in the tributes to the late Jackie (nearly five years after he died) caught the attention of the political anoraks.This is because Leo Varadkar talked about an interview he did in 1997 with RTÉ’s Brian Farrell after winning a seat in Kerry South. When Farrell asked the new TD who he felt he represented, “Jackie’s heartfelt and authentic response was: ‘I represent the plain people of Ireland’,” said the Taoiseach.When pressed about what that meant, Jackie responded with a line that has gone down in legend: “The people who eat their dinner in the middle of the day.”You don’t get away with much in Leinster House. It wasn’t long before Fianna Fáil veterans were in touch to set the record straight for Leo.They pointed out the famous “dinner in the middle of the day” remark was coined by Mark “Markeen” Killilea, long before Jackie Healy-Rae made it to the Dáil. Killilea, who died last year, entered national politics in 1977 and served as a TD, a senator and an MEP before he retired in 1999.He said it on radio to his political rival in Galway, Labour’s Michael D Higgins. It was his description of the type of people who supported Fianna Fáil.The company of WoulfeUnlike some of his distinguished legal predecessors, Attorney General Séamus Woulfe doesn’t come across as staid or standoffish when it comes to mixing with the political and journalistic rabble.For the second year in a row on Thursday, Séamus took on the thankless task of refereeing disputed answers at the Oireachtas Press Gallery charity table quiz. There was one particularly tense standoff when a veteran political correspondent and a noted authority on the history of Fine Gael questioned a ruling concerning the results of the byelection in 1917 and general election in 1918.The Woulfe of Merrion Street held his ground, backed up by quizmaster Dr David McCullagh, who is a historian as well as a journalist on RTÉ’s Prime Time.The issue was amicably resolved when our team decided not to launch a challenge in the courts following wide consultation with more drink.On Friday, June 21st, the Attorney General organised a dinner in Dublin for his predecessors – there’s a lot of them around. He decided to revive this tradition after it had lapsed for a number of years.It was an informal gathering. The convocation of legal eagles – nine in all, including the incumbent – landed in Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club in Ranelagh, where they shared common experiences and exchanged war stories over a leisurely meal. The only one missing was Dermot Gleeson, who was abroad.Between them, these lawyers know the stories behind the biggest and most explosive political and constitutional controversies in recent decades.There are unsubstantiated reports that this coming-together of seven senior counsels and two judges sparked a sudden supply crisis in the vintage port strongholds of Dublin 4 and Dublin 6.The socialising silks and previous attorneys general were Harry Whelehan, Michael McDowell, Eoghan Fitzsimons, John Rogers, David Byrne, Paul Gallagher, John Murray, Máire Whelan and Woulfe.A travesty of quiz justiceThe annual Oireachtas Press Gallery charity table quiz in the Alex Hotel on Fenian Street was a triumph, marred only by one distressing turn-up for the books.It was won by the Taoiseach’s team.A travesty, of course, compounded by this column’s ignominious slide down the results table following last year’s magnificent victory when the questions were much harder. We did, however, give the right answer to the question on Love Island, but so too, did Leo’s team. He was joined by his partner, Matt Barrett, and his chief of staff, Brian Murphy. There was a fourth team member, a young man we didn’t recognise. It turns out he is Matt’s friend who works in St Vincent’s Hospital and is a keen quizzer.There were dark mutterings about “a banger” in the Fianna Fáil ranks. Leader Micheál Martin arrived late after a number of rounds had already taken place, which was his excuse for his team trailing in behind the Taoiseach. Expect Fianna Fáil to field some serious artillery next year, if the talk of avenging party honour is anything to go by.Nearly 100 teams took part, including entries from Sinn Féin, Labour and the Social Democrats. The Independent Alliance sent a crew – although Winston Churchtown didn’t tog out, as it wouldn’t be fair to everyone else. The independent grouping of Senators had a good showing. On the night, the politicians won out over the journalists and teams drawn from Oireachtas staff.The quiz was in aid of Samaritans, and while the final tots still have to be done, almost €10,000 was raised on the night. The ranks of the defeated repaired next door to The Gingerman, where a smiling Taoiseach exercised his legitimate bragging rights before doing a flit before the midnight hour.The Delaney Golden ShoeBad news for absent-minded sports journalists. The deadline for entering the 2019 FAI Communications Awards passed on Friday.“Set up in order to recognise the excellent work being done by journalists to promote Irish football, the FAI Communications Awards stretches across all platforms including written, broadcast, digital and photographic,” reads the blurb inviting entries from “members of the sports media”.There are four categories, including a best club PRO award and one for best use of social media to promote Irish football.The photographic prize is open to amateur and professional photographers who have captured a striking image from grassroots football with a theme “that portrays the subject matter in a positive light”.Portraying the FAI in a positive light away from grassroots level may prove a stumbling block for the man who should stroll away with the gong in the Best Feature category.This award is open to journalists and contributors “who have written or created a striking feature piece that gives a unique insight to Irish football” at local, national or international level.The FAI will be all too aware that the most striking and unique insight into Irish football this year was written by Mark Tighe of the Sunday Times. It made waves locally, nationally and internationally.He broke the story John Delaney tried to injunct, blowing the lid off the shambolic nature of governance at the FAI, precipitating a shedload of inquiries and a major shake-up in the organisation and forcing the departure of the highly paid chief executive from his perk-laden position.It was a striking insight into the doomed fiefdom that was uniquely Delaney’s FAI. And a good thing for Irish football.Even if he hasn’t entered, Tighe should receive the inaugural Delaney Golden Shoe: a brass trophy commemorating the time John lost his shoes during celebrations with fans in Poland, its metal burnished to a gold-like sheen by the tongue of the former chief executive’s avid cheerleader, Michael Healy-Rae.Emmet Malone, of this parish, should get the other perpetual Delaney Golden Shoe in recognition of long years spent putting a reluctant and combative football supremo and his FAI minions under the microscope and then communicating the results to demoralised grassroots.The winners of the FAI Communications Awards will be announced at the agm delegates’ dinner in Meath on July 26th, when the Abbotstown top brass will communicate its full appreciation to journalists for all the great work they did for the organisation during the year.It’ll be very moving.A correction about emissionsTime for a correction. In last week’s column we mentioned the major photo opportunity laid on by the Government for the launch of its Climate Action Plan. It involved the Taoiseach and members of his cabinet arriving at the venue in Grangegorman on a hybrid Dublin Bus.“As a matter of interest, almost all members of Cabinet travelled on the out-of-service bus for the first leg of their short journey. Just three of them managed the return trip,” we wrote, adding that the rest of the Cabinet “shot off in their ministerial cars”.No names were used to protect the guilty.However, we were unfair to three Ministers. While they did not return from the launch by bus, they travelled instead on the Luas.The wronged unidentified Ministers are Eoghan Murphy, Paschal Donohoe and Richard Bruton. We know this because a spokesperson for each of them was in touch to correct the record first thing on Saturday morning. Before breakfast. By 8.30am, this column was made aware that three Ministers had taken the Luas.For this, in the interests of accuracy, we are most grateful. Moreover, we are very much comforted by the knowledge that three of our most senior Government Ministers are so quick off the mark when dealing with difficult situations that can suddenly arise.Ferris wheel to turn again?Is Sinn Féin’s Martin Ferris about to put the interests of his beloved party before his desire to walk into the political sunset at the next election?Nobody in Sinn Féin can say that Ferris hasn’t given everything to the cause, but a need has arisen in Kerry that it seems only he can fix. His daughter Toiréasa had been selected to run for the seat he intends to vacate after the 32nd Dáil comes to an end, but in a shock announcement earlier this month, the popular Kerry county councillor said she was withdrawing her candidacy for personal reasons.There has been no word from Sinn Féin about a replacement, but rival TDs from the region are predicting that selfless Martin will step in to the breach to try to hold on to the seat for the party, which finds itself in difficult electoral circumstances.“His Facebook activity has suddenly ramped up again and he is putting himself about a lot more,” said one observer.Will he go again? It’s not so long since those emotional scenes at Sinn Féin’s ardfheis in November of 2017, when Gerry Adams announced he would be stepping down as party leader the following year and would not be seeking re-election to the Dáil. He also surprised delegates in the same speech by disclosing that Martin Ferris would also be stepping down.The two misty-eyed men embraced and joined hands, raising them aloft as the crowd, many in tears, cheered them to the rafters.It was a time for change, said Ferris, a former IRA member and convicted gunrunner. He was 67 in February.“I’ll be able to walk Banna Strand and go out in my boat, do a little fishing. My two favourite people in the world are my two dogs.

Photograph: APThe United States and China agreed on Saturday to restart trade talks and Washington will not levy new tariffs on Chinese exports, China’s foreign ministry said, raising hopes for the world’s two largest economies to resolve their trade war.In their nearly year-long dispute, the two countries have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s imports, disrupting global supply lines, roiling markets and dragging on global economic growth.“We’re right back on track and we’ll see what happens,” US president Donald Trump told reporters after meeting Chinese president Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a summit of leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) major economies in Japan.The 80-minute meeting with Mr Xi was “excellent, as good as it was going to be,” Mr Trump added.In a lengthy statement on the talks, China’s foreign ministry said the United States would not add new tariffs on Chinese exports, and added that negotiators of both countries would discuss specific issues, but gave no details.Mr Xi told Mr Trump he hoped the United States could treat Chinese companies fairly, it added. On the issues of sovereignty and respect, China must safeguard its core interests, Mr Xi said.Before the talks, Mr Trump had threatened to extend existing tariffs to cover almost all imports from China into the United States if the meeting brought no progress on wide-ranging US demands for economic reforms.The dispute, which includes a feud over Huawei Technologies Co had also fanned fears it could threaten global growth.Financial markets were likely to welcome the news.“Returning to negotiations is good news for the business community and breathes some much needed certainty into a slowly deteriorating relationship,” said Jacob Parker, a vice-president of China operations at the US-China Business Council.At the start of Saturday’s talks, Mr Xi stressed the need for dialogue rather than confrontation.Mr Trump responded that a fair trade deal with China would be “historic” and he hoped “We can go on to do something that truly will be monumental and great for both countries.”The United States says China has been stealing American intellectual property for years, forces US firms to share trade secrets as a condition for doing business in China, and subsidizes state-owned firms to dominate industries.China has said the United States is making unreasonable demands and must also make concessions.Talks collapsed in May after Washington accused Beijing of reneging on reform pledges. Mr Trump raised tariffs to 25 per cent from 10 per cent on $200 billion of Chinese goods, and China retaliated with levies on US imports. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3940609.1561737434!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"stonewall riots key step on road to equal rights","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPolice officers try to clear a crowd  near the Stonewall Inn, in New York, on July 2nd, 1969, several days after the club was raided. Photograph: Larry MorrisNew York TimesFifty years ago this weekend, New York city witnessed a turning point in the history of gay rights. In the early hours of June 28th, 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. Raids of gay bars were not unusual at the time, but the reaction was. Within minutes a crowd had gathered outside the bar, and violence ensued.No one knows who threw the first brick, but the events of that night mushroomed, leading to five consecutive nights of protests and rioting, propelling the cause of gay rights to national prominence.The 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots is being marked across the United States this weekend. New York City Opera has commissioned a special work museums such as the Newseum in Washington and New York Public Library are hosting exhibitions. Official commemorations in New York will culminate on Sunday in a 3km march through Manhattan, beginning on Fifth Avenue and passing by the doors of the Stonewall Inn. Among those participating will be Minister for Children Katherine Zappone.The 50-year anniversary of Stonewall has renewed focus on the establishment which gave its name to one of the most important moments in the gay rights movement.Like many of New York’s gay bars, the Stonewall was owned by the Mafia at the time. This unlikely alliance between the Mob and New York’s gay community was a defining feature of gay life in the 1960s.Mafia bossesNew York law prohibited bars from serving alcohol to gay people. Open displays of homosexuality were also illegal. Local Mafia bosses spotted an opening, and began operating many gay bars in and around Greenwich Village – often bribing local police to turn a blind eye. They also allegedly operated as “bottle bars” which allowed customers to bring their own alcohol, as a way of side-stepping the liquor laws.\u0026nbspThe Genovese family had controlled vast swathes of New York’s nightclub scene since Prohibition. In 1966, Tony Lauria, or “fat Tony”, a member of the family, purchased the Stonewall Inn, which was then a straight bar. Spying a business opportunity, he soon converted it into a gay establishment.Though the Stonewall Inn closed a few years after the infamous riots, it has reopened in different forms over the decades, and was taken over by its present owners in 2006. The buildings at 51-53 Christopher Street are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and Stonewall was added to the National Historic Register in 2011. Today the site remains a mecca for many who support the concept of equality and civil rights for all.But the anniversary has also prompted debate in the United States about the true impact of Stonewall on LBGT rights.While the activism unleashed during that week helped inspire the gay rights movement, organisations such as the Gay Liberation Front (GFL) were dismantled within a few years. Despite the energy on display during the Stonewall riots, when New Yorkers – gay and straight – stood up to authorities, it took more than 40 more years for marriage equality to become a reality in the US.Fittingly, it was New York that became the first state to legislate for same-sex marriage in 2011.\u0026nbsp‘Dangerous to society’Some point to the fact that there were other moments in American history that can claim to have contributed to immense social change and advanced gay rights. The New York Times highlighted some of those moments this week. These included a decision by a court in North Carolina in 1963 to overturn a conviction of a man who dressed as a woman.“Are homosexuals twice as dangerous to society as second-degree murderers – as indicated by the maximum punishment for each offence?” the judge asked.\u0026nbspPublic demonstrations also took place in Philadelphia and New York in 1966, while Gene Compton’s cafe in San Francisco was the site of militant action the same year. All in, many ways laid the ground for Stonewall.Nonetheless the events of June 1969 continue to occupy an important role in the US cultural imagination. Today, Stonewall attracts thousands of visitors each year. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar took time to visit the site last year during his annual St Patrick’s Day visit to the United States.That the New York St Patrick’s Day parade prohibited gay people from marching until 2015 is a telling reminder of the barriers that remained until very recently. Sometimes it takes some years before the social change propelled by key moments in history can truly make a difference."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignBoris Johnson denies he is \u0026#39measuring the curtains\u0026#39 for No 10 by offering Cabinet jobsComment: Politicians\u0026#39 pastimes have only made me more ashamed of having no hobbiesBritish troops must have better legal protection, say Boris Johnson and Jeremy HuntSir Alan Duncan calls Boris Johnson a \u0026#39circus act\u0026#39 unfit to govern the countryGeorge Osborne plots political comeback as he sets sights on marginal seatComment: The next PM must declare war on May\u0026#39s legacy of busybodying and petty rules Theresa May urges other countries to step forward as she unveils £1.4bn in fight against killer diseasesFestival-goers complain of water refill queues at Glastonbury as heatwave continues The 17 hottest plays and musicals to book tickets for this summerComment: Putin\u0026#39s attack on liberalism reminds us that the cause of freedom is well worth fighting forComment: Strict laws govern the battlefield.

The city’s narrow Remain vote was out of step with the wider regionMany in northeast England express anger at what they see as patronising and insulting explanations for their vote to leave the EU. They say that they are being portrayed as hillbillies from the deindustrialised wastelands of the north who stupidly acted against their own best interests. They particularly object to the cliche describing their strong support for Brexit as “turkeys voting for Christmas”.“I call it ‘prole porn’,” says one Leave supporter from Newcastle who did not want his name published, condemning what he considers to be a crude caricature of the reasons why a majority in the northeast – and particularly those from “proletarian” areas – want Britain out of the European Union. He says that the reasoning behind the region’s 58 to 42 per cent vote for Leave in the 2016 referendum was nuanced, rational and not simply an ill-considered thumbs-down to the status quo. “It was far more complex than a simple wish to give the government a kick in the teeth,” he says, “and voters really did understand why they were voting for Brexit.”Others in the northeast vigorously contest this. Tony Curtis, a vicar in Shiremoor, North Tyneside, has a parish centred on deprived housing estates, but with a flourishing business park employing 8,000 people at one end of it. Asked to explain why people voted for Brexit, he says: “They largely did so because of scapegoating – blame everything on Brussels, blame everything on immigration. In the past this has been a useful excuse for governments that failed to replace traditional shipbuilding and heavy industry, particularly along the coast from Sunderland to Teesside where you see the strongest support for Leave. When the referendum happened, all those chickens came home to roost.”The referendum decision may have been a protest vote, but then the 2.6 million people living in the region have a lot to protest aboutCurtis, formerly an executive in the railways whom friends say took a £150,000 salary cut to retrain as a clergyman, says that it is a mistake to see everybody in the northeast as desperate to leave the EU. As in the rest of the UK, the poll showed strong support for both sides: Newcastle narrowly voted Remain, while in the northern part of the region – also including North Tyneside, Northumberland, Gateshead, Darlington and Durham – the Remain vote was well over 40 per cent. It is further south, in places like Middlesbrough, Redcar and Hartlepool, that Leave support is stronger and only a third or less of voters wanted to stay in the EU.The referendum decision may have been a protest vote, but then the 2.6 million people in the region have a lot to protest about. Andy Pike, professor of regional development studies at Newcastle University, says that “post-2008, you have a collapse in real wages which is most acutely felt in deindustrialised and coastal areas. A lot of people there were voting Leave as a cry of rage.” Where new jobs are created, they tend to be low-quality and poorly paid. The northeast has the highest proportion of minimum- or living-wage jobs in the country. With so many people on low incomes, the region is disproportionately hit by cuts to the benefit system and welfare reform. Some 25 per cent of jobs are in the public sector so any reduction in government spending will likewise affect the region particularly badly.Pike makes the point that the northeast is vulnerable to any dislocation in trade following Brexit because “it exports more goods per capita to the EU than any other region”. Cars and pharmaceuticals would be seriously affected. The crisis over leaving the EU and central government in London thinking about nothing but Brexit is having a chilling effect on investment. If Nissan – with its 5,000 employees in its car plant in Sunderland and a further 36,000 among its suppliers – is closed, “it would be a meltdown scenario, a real hammer blow, and I don’t think we could come back from that”.International companies with branches in the region will be frightened off, according to Pike. Because of the overall weakness of the northeast’s economy, it would be less able than other parts of the UK to absorb the kind of punch that could be just round the corner if there were a radical break with Europe. If there are economic opportunities post-Brexit in the shape of new markets abroad or import substitution at home, as Eurosceptics claim, then Pike doubts if the northeast has the resources or the adaptability to take advantage of them. He says that the northeast has done well out of well-administered EU funding for the region, which an over-centralised British government may not be able to replicate.A German guy who used to run our cancer research woke up after the vote and decided that the place he was living in did not want him anymore and he went off to the NetherlandsSupporters of Remain say that they find it inexplicable that people in the northeast should want to leave the EU when they are likely to be the first and most serious casualty of the UK’s departure. The EU is Britain’s largest single market, three times bigger than the US, and EU funding has been targeted at deprived regions like the northeast, the Welsh valleys and rural counties such as Cornwall and Lincolnshire.Created with Sketch.An immigrant\u0026#39s tale: Leaving Britain to escape Brexit hostility Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Maria, 31, holds her daughters, Elena, two, and baby Ioana, weeks old, in her London homeA few months after Britain voted to leave the European Union, Maria was told her to go back to her native Romania whilst in hospital by an elderly English woman. “You are a foreigner, your place is not here” recalls Maria, who was stunned220 Maria and her husband Adi, 37, take their daughters for a walk in Hampstead Heath near their homeThe couple are preparing to leave Britain later this year with their two children, fed up with what Maria says is xenophobia and the rising cost of living in LondonElena holds up British passports belonging to her and her sister.

With 28,000 students and 5,500 staff, the university is firmly plugged into the same globalised world that others in the northeast may see as destabilising or destroying their way of life. All over Europe, expanded universities have been a much-favoured means of regenerating cities that are no longer centres of commerce and industry. It is a formula that works well: Newcastle draws 80 per cent of its annual intake of 5,500 students from outside the northeast, but half of them stay on to work in the region after graduation. Newcastle city centre has been revived, but universities – Northumbria University in Newcastle has another 27,000 students – do not come near to replacing the engineering and chemical works, shipyards and mines, that once put the northeast of England at the heart of the industrial revolution.Chris Day, the vice chancellor of Newcastle University, confesses that he was surprised when the UK voted three years ago to leave the EU: “It is the company you keep – university and London people didn’t understand what Sunderland and Wales were thinking.” For him and his university, the pluses of EU membership and the minuses of Brexit are obvious, especially in the funding of research. The UK government gives £900m to the EU for research and UK universities get £1.6bn back because of the high quality of British research applications. Day wonders if a strapped-for-cash post-Brexit government will be paying British universities the larger or smaller sum to fund research and whether or not that funding will come with restrictive conditions. EU structural funding has provided a lot of money for the university and may not be replaced on a like-for-like basis.  So far, the prospect of Brexit has had only a limited concrete impact on Newcastle University, though it has generated acute anxiety among some of its staff. Day says: “A German guy who used to run our cancer research woke up after the vote and decided that the place he was living in did not want him any more and he went off to the Netherlands.” As yet, staff and student numbers are unaffected, but collaboration with EU universities may be hampered in future. Above all, there is concern about Britain’s reputation in the academic world and whether or not – as the vice chancellor puts it – the country will be viewed “from abroad as an isolated xenophobic place”.The probable answer is that top universities like Newcastle and Durham have sufficient clout and prestige to withstand any shocks brought about by Brexit, but less well-established universities throughout the UK will find themselves in trouble.Universities are notoriously centres of support for Britain staying in the EU. So too, to a lesser extent, are the central core of the big cities. But they are both atypical of the wider region in which they stand where the population is much less impressed by the benefits of 45 years of EU membership. Much of the industrial decline of the northeast took place after Britain joined the EU in 1973. It may be arguable how far this was the inevitable result of globalisation and new technology, but it is undeniable that the EU did not arrest this process or do anything that effectively alleviated its consequences in the eyes of those hardest hit. Many of those who were “left behind” or, more accurately, “left out” of the new global economy live and work in the north of England.  It is this pervasive sense of alienation and dislocation that fuelled support for Brexit three years ago and still does. Leave and Remain campaigners tell the same story. James, a highly intelligent student from Gateshead who does not want his real name published, joined Ukip as a schoolboy in 2014 because he was impressed by what Nigel Farage was saying. He missed the first week of the term during which he should have been studying for his A-levels in order to campaign for Ukip in the Clacton by-election. “My teachers were not too happy about that,” he recalls. He denies that the pro-Leave vote was propelled solely by frustration with the status quo: “You can’t read Brexit as an absolute proxy for other issues.” People wanted greater control over their lives, immigration and government he says. They felt they had been ignored for too long.But James believes that underlying these grievances was a more generalised discontent stemming “from economic changes under Thatcher and Blair’s failure to bring anything new to most of the area. When I was campaigning in places like Hartlepool, people said that nothing had gone their way for 30 years and they wanted something different – it didn’t have to be a definite plan, it just had to be different.”Corbyn accused of ‘muddle’ after Labour fails to agree Brexit shiftUK carmakers: Post-Brexit border delays would cost us £50,000 a minuteJohnson backtracks on claim UK could escape no-deal Brexit tariffsBrexit has hurt UK economy and more pain is likely – researchersBrussels was in the worst possible position: it was powerful enough to be denounced as a bureaucratic monster, but not powerful enough to be seen as a protector against the ravages of globalisation and deindustrialisation. James, who left Ukip to join the Conservatives in 2017, said arguments against the EU resonated in places like the former steel town of Redcar in North Yorkshire “because of the inability of the EU to use tariffs to stop Chinese steel-dumping”.Alex Snowden, a radical left-wing activist, also sees the EU as “doing more harm than good”, but for reasons largely different from those advanced by James. He criticises the EU’s neoliberal agenda, typified by its mistreatment of Greece its anti-democratic overriding of the decisions of elected national governments and its restrictive policy towards refugees trying to enter the EU, so many of whom have drowned in the Mediterranean (more people die on EU borders than on any other borders in the world). These would have been very much minority opinions among voters whose motivations he lists as anti-immigrant feeling a vague anti-establishment stance and “a sense that decisions are being made elsewhere by people who are not accountable to us”.The economic consequences of Brexit have yet to be seen, but its political impact is very much with us and has brought about unprecedented political fluidity and fragmentationThe outcome of the referendum surprised him because “I thought people would play it safe at the end of the day, as they had done in the Scottish referendum on independence”. He says that at the time many people were not passionate about leaving, but were asking questions like “what do we have to lose? Things are already desperate, so let’s give it a go, let’s see what happens.” In places like Sunderland – where people had been “just getting by” since the 2008 recession, exacerbated by austerity after 2010 – there was a sense that “the EU just was not worth it” while, further south in the region, “Teesside hasn’t got anything positive out of the EU”.Snowden says that these opinions have not changed much since the referendum. “I think that there has been a solidification of views and isions are deeper than in 2016,” he says. People’s core sense of identity has become much more wrapped up in their position for or against the EU. “But it isn’t just views on the EU any more but a wider sense of alienation and dislocation.”As Brexit becomes the vehicle for a wide range of beliefs and disbeliefs and the touchstone for people’s personal and national identity, Snowden believes that there is a hardening of views. “Everybody tends to underestimate the strength of feeling on the other side,” he says. He does not think that the far right has expanded its constituency very far and Ukip has largely imploded, but he warns that this might change if there was a second referendum which reversed the decision of the one three years ago and decided to stay in the EU: “If that happened I think there would be a boost to Ukip and the Brexit Party and street-fighting by fascist groups.” Anne Brennan in Sunderland agrees that people are frightened of a no-deal Brexit, but says they do not talk about it much in her school staff room unless she raises the topic.The economic consequences of Brexit have yet to be seen, but its political impact is very much with us and has brought about unprecedented political fluidity and fragmentation. James joined the Conservative Party and thinks that it was a mistake for the Eurosceptics not to vote through Theresa May’s deal: “At least we would have got the first stage of the withdrawal agreement done.”Farage on the first leg of the March to Leave campaign, which saw the pro-Leave group walk from Sunderland to Hartlepool (Getty)The former – and somewhat mellowed – Ukip member James has an interesting take on the prospects for the Brexit Party. He says that “if BP can go forward without the ‘nuttiness’ that has overtaken Ukip, they have a future.” But he believes that if they ever get into government – “God forbid,” he interjects – they would immediately split because their activists tend to be ultra-Thatcherite free-marketeers who would like Britain to be like Singapore, while many of their voters are in deindustrialised places like Hartlepool and are old Labour who view Thatcherism and privatisation as the source of all evil. James believes it is better to stick with the two-party system of Conservatives and Labour, but confesses that to keep Labour out he voted for the Brexit Party in the European elections and the Liberal Democrats in the local elections.On the left as well as the right old allegiances are loosening, though it is too early to tell if the trend will be temporary or permanent. David Hardman is a marketing consultant and former Labour councillor in Newcastle who resigned from the party because of its ambivalence over Brexit. He believes that Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party pose a serious danger to British society and democracy and favours a second referendum, saying constituencies such as Sunderland that voted strongly Leave in the referendum still returned Labour MPs in the general election. He says that there is a change in public opinion in the northeast in favour of Remain: “There has been a substantial shift of 9-10 per cent against Leave in Sunderland and Durham, less in Hartlepool and Teesside.”Whatever type of Brexit emerges, the northeast of England is in a poor position to cope with an economic shock like that of leaving the EU. It has never recovered from the devastating deindustrialisation of the last half-century. In addition, there is the impact of years of austerity and cuts in government spending since 2010. Speaking of her school in South Shields, Anne Brennan says that “pens and glue sticks are often in short supply because there is no money for them, so a lot of the time you end up having to buy your own”. In North Tyneside, Tony Curtis says: “We’ve had a substantial increase in antisocial behaviour. We had a spell last year when we had gangs of youths roaming around breaking things and the police were unable to respond because of lack of numbers. The vicarage was burgled, we had our car stolen and we had to close the school playing field and install CCTV. Nothing like that had ever happened before.”David Hardman makes a more basic point. He says that the mantra of the Eurosceptics that Britain will be able to flourish outside the EU is fundamentally flawed. “People say, ‘We did it before and we’ll do it again,’” based on an assumption that the British are better than foreigners. “But we are not competitive in terms of skills and education,” he says. “The northeast’s economy will be massively hit. We simply don’t have a competitive edge anymore.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Read our guide on how to find them along with a bunch of other useful festival tips.According to the festival organisers there will be more than , long drop seats across the site this year, with over , compost toilets which should only have toilet paper thrown down the hole with your waste. Urinals are dotted around everywhere. In fact there are  metres of male urinals across the site.  There are female urinals known as “Shepees” with four sites across the compound at the: Cider Bus, The Park, Glasto Latino and in the Kings Meadow.Compost toilets are designed to break down the waste and the toilet paper to compost with a “bulking agent”.There is a long drop which means many people can use them.  There are also some disabled toilets on the site, which have easy access for wheelchair users on viewing s at all the main stages. Don’t take items you don’t need. Think to yourself do you really require the spare gazebo Check out your camping kit in advance — do you have all the guy ropes, ground sheet and pegs. Also, take a mallet because that ground is likely to be hard. And most important of all - don’t forget your ticket. Any items that will ruin the environment or harm revellers is banned from the site. Glass bottles are banned. So are mirrors. Festival authorities will confiscate them should they see them. Non-biodegradable body glitter is also barred. While Glastonbury isn’t forbidding fans from getting all glammed-up, they are urging people to use products that are biodegradable.Disposable wipes are a no-no-no.They are known to quickly break down into micro-plastics — which has been an ongoing environmental problem.While not officially banned, gazebos are highly discouraged from being brought to the event.Also banned are portable laser equipment and pens, animals other than registered guide dogs, sound systems, drums and generators.Yes, you can take alcohol onto the site.But be warnedyou take too many slabs of cans, the organisers may think you are trying to sell them on and could confiscate your stocks.Beer tents on the site are run by the Workers Beer Company and Avalon bars. These have London pub prices.You might have the best phone out there, but its useless unless it works.Charging your device is getting easier with each passing year and often your provider will be on site to help. But queues at any charging spots will be epic. So it is best to buy a couple of portable charges. Better still - ration your phone juice and always arrange to meet your friends at a good meeting place. Reception is likely to be bad as well, so calling and texting might not be effective. The weather is likely going to be hot with temperatures peaking at C. But there could also be a small chance of thunder and lightning, which can be dangerousyou are standing out in the open. Check out the Met Office Glastonbury weather for up-to-date forecasts. The best advice is to check out the Glastonbury Clashfinder.Try not to see everything because you might end up missing a lot. Go for a wander and see what you stumble upon. Perhaps take in some comedy, spoken word, theatre or even circus performances.Maybe have a massage or do some chilling in the Green Fields or see some jazz. You will lose your pals during Glasto, as sure as night turns to day.But the Find My Friends app allows you to find each other during the maelstrom.And should you wish not to be found you can always turn off the GPS location on the app.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Hunt changed his position on the redevelopment of Undershaw, the former home of Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his consistuency. The South West Surrey MP originally supported upgrading the listing of Undershaw from Grade II to Grade I while fans of the author were campaigning to prevent the house being turned into flats in .But letters obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Surrey Live show he subsequently lobbied against upgrading the houseaposs listed status. This left the way clear for charity, the DFN Charitable Foundation, to convert the building into a special needs school, Stepping Stones, which opened in . DFN Charitable Foundation is run by, and named after, businessman David Forbes-Nixon, who later donated £, to his campaign for the Conservative Party leadership in May . The donation was declared in the proper way and there is no suggestion of wrongdoing. A source close to the leadership hopeful said that donations have no bearing on Mr Huntaposs decisions.    English Heritageaposs decision to keep Undershaw listed as Grade II meant the DFN Trust, which had acquired the house in April , stood a much better chance of getting planning permission to build its new school, which it eventually did following an unsuccessful legal challenge by John Gibson - a member of the campaign to upgrade the listing. However, despite his previous support for reclassying Undershaw as Grade I, it now appears that Mr Hunt lobbied extensively for the house to remain Grade II once the DFN Trust became involved.   In April , he wrote to his successor as culture secretary, Sajid Javid , saying he had been asked by DFN Charitable Trust...to write to you to object to a proposed upgrade of an existing Listed Building, known as Undershaw, in Hindhead, Surrey.Mr Hunt added that he thought the DFN proposal would see the building restored to its former glory, saying: My concern as indeed highlighted to me by DFN Charitable Trust is that the case for an upgrade has been made as part of a long campaign by objectors to a previous residential scheme on the site, to try and thwart any redevelopment of the site.John Gibson, a key member of the campaign to upgrade Undershawaposs listing, told Surrey Live : It would appear with regard to Jeremy Hunt , to paraphrase George Orwell, all constituents are equal, but some are more equal than others.A spokesman for Jeremy Hunt told the Daily Mirror: All donations are declared in the proper way.  "},{"url":null,"title":"labour rubbish claims jeremy corbyn","story":"NewsLabour rubbish claims Jeremy Corbyn is too frail to be Prime MinisterA Labour spokesman said Jeremy Corbyn lives an active le in response to a report claiming civil servants fear he is too frail to be Prime MinisterShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  JUN NewsLabour have rejected claims Jeremy Corbyn is too frail to be Prime Minister \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour last night rejected claims Jeremy Corbynaposs health could torpedo his bid for No.The Times claimed senior civil servants feared he has become “too frail and is losing his memory” and maybe forced to step down as Labour leader.

Considering her successor has not indicated there will be enough drinking water, whether it will be delivered by tap or army, orthere is a missing comma which means November st is more of a worry, you might expect Theresa May to display the same uncontrolled tremors as Angela Merkel. But youaposd be wrong. This is a woman who has seen the light at the end of the tunnel and no longer gives much of a toss whether it is a truck or a train, just so long as itaposs not another meaningless vote that will entail having to deal with those parts of her party that other humans cannot reach.And so she stepped off the plane in Tokyo for her final G summit with the same devil-may-care attitude to international diplomacy that we more often associate with those who call the French turds and then get the BBC to delete it.This is a woman who  years ago displayed indecent haste to clutch the hand of a man who combines stupidity with fascism. She entrusted the fate of Brexit to a man who failed as a weekend warrior. And she smiled broadly on the steps of Downing Street with a Saudi princeling who has used British jets and British bombs to pound Yemen and leave m of that countryaposs citizens reliant on food aid.The front row of the G family photo is a Usual Suspects-style mugshot of some of the worldaposs best-known despots. She managed to raise a smile for that. But asked to pose for a photo with Vladimir Putin, Mrs May adopted the same facial expression as someone asked to pick up cat poo.   All the more remarkable, considering how chuffed she managed to look when she met him in .Now, Putin has not been markedly more awful in the past  years. Back then, he was killing opponents, finagling democratic votes, oppressing minorities and was considered to have ordered the murders of  journalists whose words were a danger to his grip on power.By that point he had also imported radioactive polonium- into the UK, had it administered to the defector Alexander Litvinenko, protected the two men who carried out the killing, and promoted one of them to the Duma.His agents had been suspected of involvement in Parliamentary honeytraps and the body-in-a-bag murder of GCHQ boffin Gareth Williams. He had annexed the Crimea, doped his way to  Olympic medals , and had his military shoot down  holidaymakers as their jet flew over Ukraine where his soldiers were occupying a country that had voted to be more European. We may wrinkle our noses with distaste at all that, but diplomacy requires a smile. And weHADimposed sanctions on the little bugger. So whataposs changed since this happiest of snaps, aside from his tie Thereaposs been even more sanctions. Four more journalists have been killed, apparently on Putinaposs orders. And heaposs followed up his WMD proleration by using a chemical weapon in Salisbury, where the cathedral spire is really great but the perfume bottles are deadly.He tried to kill Sergei Skripal, a British intelligence asset. This may be something many nations - and defectors - accept as a risk in the great game, but he did it in a way that was breathtakingly careless. Not only was nerve agent smeared on a door handle which could have been touched by almost anyone, it was discarded in a park where it was picked up by Dawn Sturgess. Thinking it was perfume, she sprayed it on herself. Litvinenko died slowly, and was conscious for most of the  weeks in which his body broke down. Dawn died after  days in a coma. Both were buried in specially-sealed coffins, in case the poisons that killed them leaked.  Yesterday Putin said it was a fuss about spies and traitors must be punished.Dawn was not a spy. She was not a traitor. She was a mother, a daughter, and a partner.   Other things have happened, too. Russia is now all but broke, after a recession and economic stagnation brought about by sanctions. The country is now considered by experts to no longer be a democracy, and it is believed that Putin is the worldaposs richest man, outstripping even the combined wealth of Bill Gates AND Jeff Bezos. The aircraft carrier he threateningly steamed through the English Channel was so old and decrepit it could be defeated by a Nerf gun. His Red Square military parades show off prototypes of tanks and missiles he cannot afford to build, and his vast armed forces mostly consist of conscripts who have no idea what theyaposre doing. He spends what little money he has on gold toilets. And now Putin and May both know sheaposs off, and heaposs not. His term ends in , and her timeaposs up in less than a month. She can demand action, and the surrender of murder suspects, all she likes. He probably sat there and picked his nose and wondered which female on his payroll would be most likely to get Novichok on Borisapos knob.The only weapons Putin has left are poisonous thoughts, and computer keyboards. And May has seen the evidence that he used them to manipulate the Brexit vote. May is not a woman to exhibit much in the way of principle or decency. She can see  dead bodies pulled out of a burned tower block and NOT order every other tower block to be made safe. She can draw red lines that later turn out to be imaginary, send Go Home vans around erse cities, and create an environment so hostile that British citizens are deported on her watch. She sees no need to apologise for any of it. She is not making her distaste clear because she knows she is shaking the hand of an indiscriminate, power-crazed killer who would still be cackling even as James Bond wound his entrails out of him with a stick. She is not grimacing because she has to be nice to a tyrant, or because his proxies manipulated the British democratic process in the hope,not the act, of arranging an outcome that would damage and destabilise every Western democracy he loathes. She doesnapost give a toss about fake news, troll factories, the US election, Hillary Clintonaposs leaked emails, treating Julian Assange as a useful idiot, or those British citizens suspected to be the victims or patsies of Putin, his cronies or his desperate need to launder his billions in foreign states before he is kicked out of his own. She is upset for one of two reasons. Either he is single-handedly responsible for the nightmare of Brexit which overshadowed her short, painful and utterly fruitless premiership, or he knows who leaked that Windrush report."},{"url":null,"title":"new state pension rules leave","story":"NewsNew state pension rules leave retired couples vulnerable to financial shocksChange means a typical pensioner’s household income could plummet by up to % following the death of a partnerShareCommentsByTricia Phillips:,  JUN NewsA change to the state pension could leave retired couples on a kne edge financially, research suggests \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailState pension rules could lead to unexpected financial misery, analysis reveals. A little noticed change, which came into effect in , means a typical pensioner’s household income could plummet by up to % following the death of a spouse. This could leave many struggling to make ends meet because bills might only drop by a small amount. Former Pensions minister Sir Steve Webb said: “As well as the emotional impact of bereavement, losing a spouse in later le can have a huge impact on living standards.    “Under the new state pension system, widows and widowers will inherit little,anything, of their late spouse’s pension, and income from an annuity often ceases when the recipient dies.” Sir Steve, director of policy at insurer Royal London, which did the analysis, added: “Household outgoings may reduce somewhat but income is likely to fall by much more.”    Before , when a married person died, their spouse was entitled to make a claim to boost their state pension income based on the deceased partner’s National Insurance record. This has now been abolished as the amount of state pension we each receive is based on inidual NI records only. An added problem is that some older women have no private workplace pension savings.

It means marriages could take place at home or outdoor spots rather than a church or a registry office. It would also save prospective husbands and wives some hard-pressed cash as they will not have to fork out for a licensed premises hire. The Government has launched a two-year review on how and where marriages can take place. At the moment they must be carried out in a licensed venue by a registrar or licensed minister for them to be legally binding.    That means couples who want an outdoor wedding – currently only permitted in Scotland – have to have two events, one legal and the other ceremonial. Religious chiefs insists a church is still “the best place” for a wedding. But the Wedding Celebrancy Commission welcomed the review. Member Anne Barber said: “There is a huge demand from couples who say they don’t want to go the to the registry office before. They want to do it at the same time.” And National Association of Wedding Professionals director Siobhan Craven-Robins added: “This eliminates the hire cost of booking a licensed venue. It creates more opportunity for people who are on a tighter budget.”Theresa May said: “We can do more to bring the laws on marriage ­ceremonies up to date.”But Humanists UK argue the reforms should go further to join Scotland and the Ireland in allowing ­celebrants to perform legally binding ceremonies.    The laws, many of which date back to the th century, will be reviewed by the Law Commission, which will consult with faith groups. Any new venues would have to meet the existing test of solemnity. But the Church of England said research shows being “married in a place that has meaning is still important”.Reverend Canon Dr Sandra Millar, who heads the CofE’s work on weddings, said: “The moments of waiting to walk down the aisle, standing at the steps and exchanging timeless vows that can only be said in a church, and turning to walk out of the church as anewly-married couple, are cherished.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tv licence letters sent over","story":"NewsLetters warning over-s that free TV licence will be axed have already gone outEXCLUSIVE: Protesters will be furious to learn that elderly viewers are now forced to prove they receive state pension top-upsShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsRicky Tomlinson protests against the scrapping of the free TV licence outside BBC Media City \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPensioners desperate to keep their free TV licence have been told they will have to prove they receive state pension top-ups.

It takes dozens of officers to follow someone – with the added complication of watching all of the iniduals that they meet.    Mistakes are made as highly-trained followers cut a fine line between observation and trying not to be spotted – and possibly killed. There are currently a staggering  live MI investigations into possible terror attacks – by the woefully under-staffed intelligence agency. There may be another , “Butts” ready to attack. And despite all of the so-called alarm bells that have emerged in the inquest it really didn’t ever look like this outrage might happen, before the event. And perhaps, even despite the dreadful horror of what happened on London Bridge, it might not have been as terrible as some of those other attacks that are being smashed every few weeks.

It has sparked a potential diplomatic crisis between the two countries - and the Sheik has voiced his fury in an Instagram post, accusing her of betrayal. He wrote: “Go to whom you get busy with!!!!! ” According to The Sun, the princess has taken £million to start her new le. Unconfirmed reports state that she has also taken son Zayed, seven, and daughter Al Jalila, , with her. Princess Haya, , is half-sister of the King of Jordan. She married Sheikh Mohammed in  and is an accomplished show-jumper.   Sheikh Mohammed, , is vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, as well as leader of the Emirate of Dubai. He is believed to be worth £billion.The end of his marriage is a fresh blow to the Sheik after one of his daughters - Princess Lata bint Mohammed Maktoum,  - attempted to escape last year before being captured on a boat off the Indian coast. Princess Lata said abuse forced her to flee the kingdom - and human rights groups claim she is being held in captivity in Dubai.    She is reportedly seeking political asylum in Germany, having not been seen in public since February. Radha Stirling, chief executive of watchdog Detained in Dubai, said: “Whenever someone applies for political asylum, obviously, it is because their lives are in danger, and because they have suffered severe abuses and violations of their human rights. “We already know that Princess Lata, Sheikh Mohammed’s daughter, fled the UAE seeking asylum and alleging unspeakable abuse at the hands of her father.  “Now, it seems, Princess Haya, Sheikh Mohammed’s we, has also fled the country and sought refuge in Germany.” She said there are now serious questions about what prompted Princess Haya - sister of the King of Jordan - to flee. Reports in the Middle East claim Germany has refused a request tothe Sheikhaposs we.  According to sources close to the royal family, Princess Haya is hoping to secure a orce from her wealthy husband - who last week attended Royal Ascot alone. The Princess - who has not updated her social media accounts since February - usually accompanies her husband to the event. German authorities have refused to comment on reports of Princess Hayaaposs escape from her husband.

Sarah Ferguson met Natashaaposs parents, Tanya and Nadim, when they were flying home from France with her coffin days after she tragically suffered an allergic reaction and died. Natasha, , collapsed on a flight after eating a sandwich she bought at Heathrow Airport containing sesame seeds, to which she was allergic. The sandwich did not list sesame seeds on the label. She later died in hospital in Nice, France. Sarah Ferguson sat just a row behind the Ednan-Laperouse couple when they flew back with their daughteraposs corpse on the British Airways flight. Mother Tanya recalled the moment when the Duchess put her hand through the space between the seats and grabbed her hands and said: Iaposm so sorry. Is there anything I can do to help you     Speaking on ITV’s This Morning alongside Natasha’s parents, the Duchess said: As a mother, I just went ‘oh my gosh, right, ok. What can we do ’ I just kept my hand there. I was so pushy. But actually, for Natasha’s sake and sitting here today, thank heavens we were really. I just kept thinking of Beatrice and Eugenie. I kept thinking ‘I don’t – no’.” The Duchess gave support to the couple and eventually became friends as they worked together to promote clearer labelling on food products. She is the patron of NARF and takes her role seriously, attending meetings with scientists whose research into immunotherapy is helping to treat and reduce allergic symptoms.    Sarah attended Natashaaposs funeral in November  and Tanya was invited to the Duchessaposs daughter, Princess Eugenieaposs wedding last October. Tanya recalled the moment she received her husbandaposs call from Nice when Nadim said: You need to come quickly. Something really bad has happened to Natasha. She then continued: I said: aposWhat does that mean apos and he said she had less than a  per cent chance of living. I just broke down. You go into this strange, surreal mode where everything seems weirdly muted. It’s like a coma of the mind. When she was gone, all I could do was sob. I cut locks of her hair to keep and then they took her to the mortuary, says Nadim.    Nadim said at an inquest earlier this month that his daughter died because of “inadequate food labelling laws” as the packaging did not mention the baguette contained the seeds. The family are calling for greater consistency in labelling and want products to be physically labelled with complete allergen information.Environment Secretary Michael Gove introduced a law named after Natasha, which will require labels to list all ingredients on pre-packaged foods, this week.The Natashaaposs Law will be in force by summer  in bids to protect the country’s two million food allergy sufferers. Allergy UK said the law “will improve lives” but trade body UKHospitality cautioned the measures could be “impractical and potentially hazardous”. Chief executive Kate Nicholls said: Smaller businesses may struggle and it is almost certainly going to lead to much less choice for customers. There is also a risk the new measures will only promote a dangerous reliance on labelling.

But that could soon change – because pub crawls with a dferent are pulling in punters around the country. We gave our reporters the arduous task of trying out a few... Paul RoutledgeTranspennine Real Ale Trail This is more of a pilgrimage than a pub crawl. I started in a puffer-nutter’s paradise, the Station Buffet Bar, Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, a magnicent Victorian celebration of all things railway. And beer.  Tourists will wow to this bit of olde England, historic train stuff on the walls and white-bearded relics of the steam age knocking it back at am. It’s not cheap but it is theatre. Which cannot be said of the The Railway Inn, Greenfield, just up the valley, which is shut. And the train is cancelled too, so it’s the  bus over Saddleworth Moor to the Riverhead Brewery Tap, Marsden. Altogether more welcoming. We’re now in Yorkshire and the village is the birthplace of Poet Laureate Simon Armitage.He’d compose an ode to my pint of Ossett Blonde.    Ever onwards, ever down the Colne Valley to The Commercial, Slaithwaite , which is quiet but, who cares, with Commerci’ale made round the corner by Empire Brewing at £. a pint.Next up is The King’s Head, in the east wing of Grade- listed Huddersfield station where I often partake with Robert Sutclfe of the town’s Daily Examiner newspaper. In the square outside, statuesque Harold Wilson – a brandy man, for all the talk of beer and sandwiches in No – turns his back on the pub. Canalside in Mirfield, The Navi­gation is a favourite of ale-trailers. They throng through in fancy dress, stag and hen parties. Cheaper than Prague, when you take the air fare into account. Finally made it to The West Riding, on Dewsbury station.   Another Victorian masterpiece with coal firesand a cracking pint of Black Sheep as it should be for £.. First-rate pizza and all-day breakfast for trailers. All these pubs are close to – or on – stations on the Manchester to Leeds line. With such delicious distractions, I’m surprised anybody ever gets to either city. But given the record of Northern Rail and Transpennine Trains, who’s to tell  Amanda Killelea Manchester gin crawl Think of a Manchester and booze and it may conjure up a vision of Mel Sykes leaning out of an ice cream van with a pint of Boddington’s, asking “Do you want a flake in that, love ” But gin is now the drink of choice, with thousands of flavours on offer in dozens of gin bars across the city.  Clever marketing and imaginative ingredients have re-ignited our love affair with the tipple once known as mother’s ruin. Oliver Wrigley’s family have run the Atlas bar in Deansgate for the past eight years. They were the behind the city’s gin revolution, after spotting a gap in the market for artisan products. The bar now stocks over  ieties and is the first stop for afficionados on the city’s burgeoning Gin Journey. Oliver says: “The laws on gin production changed in , opening the market to smaller artisan companies. That’s why there is so much choice.”He pours me his favourite Isle of Harris gin – produced from kelp mixed with a tonic made from quinine grown on the Inca trail in Peru. Weird...but quite wonderful, too. Next stop is Gorilla bar, which has its own dedicated gin parlour tucked away on the first floor where it infuses its own gin with berries, herbs and olives. Bartender Ben Thompson, , says: “We have regulars who have gone back to the traditional way of drinking gin with soda rather than tonic, so they can taste the intense flavour.”Manchester’s regenerated and flourishing Northern Quarter, home to countless independent cafes, bars and restaurants, is on the city’s popular gin crawl. In Cottonopolis drinkers can even give Japanese gins a whirl. But manager Gethin Jones explains that even the fanciest of his cocktails won’t break the bank. I’d better call it a day there, though, otherwise these oh-so-alluring new gins could be this mother’s ruin too. Rachael Bletchly Liquid History Tour, London Iaposm on my third gin and tonic in just over an hour and beginning to feel pleasantly fuzzy. I’ve been enthusing about pork scratchings to a couple from Guatemala, swapping Winston Churchill-isms with a guy from Texas and chatting about a foul-mouthed parrot with Simon and Amanda from Harpenden.  And, although it’s only pm, I’m now trying to persuade a reluctant barman to take me down to the cellar and show me his crown jewels.Or, rather, the vault where the priceless royal gems were stashed during the Blitz to protect them from Nazi bombers. But then Freddie, our cheery guide, tells us to drink up and my  new chums and I pour out of the Old Bank of England Pub on to Fleet Street, heading for another boozer and more fascinating stories. I’ve joined one of the award- winning pub crawls delighting tourists with a quirky mix of history, literature, politics, pop culture, architecture and, of course, alcohol.  They were set up eight years ago by former international tour guide John Warland, . He calls them “love letters to London’s old ale houses and gin palaces”, highlighting their fascinating history while giving hard-pressed landlords a boost – at a time when pubs a week are being forced to close down. And the  to -year-old tourists who pay £ a head for the pleasureclearly think they’re liquid gold. The regular walk takes three to four hours, stopping at half a dozen pubs. But a private group once crammed in  boozers… and then managed to take in a gin distillery. Guide Freddie Heacock, , said: “People rarely come on the tour to get hammered.” The funny, friendly walking encyclopedia of beer and history added: “The foreign visitors find it a great way to see the city, hear some stories and find out about our pub culture and dferent ales. “But we get a lot of locals too.” I urge you take the tour – it really is the best bar none.

We’re at the Salutation Inn , the third drinking hole on this very dferent kind of pub crawl. Or more precisely, we’re in one of the caves deep beneath it where peasants once lived. And where, according to our cackling guide Madame Parboiled, many a poor soul met an unpleasant end. Four-year-old Rosie was knocked down by a cart and buried in the cave.  “Just there on the spot you’re sitting,” shrieks Madame Parboiled, making a fellow drinker spit out his beer. If you’re looking for a pub crawl which leaves you with more than just a hang-over, this is definitely it. Kath George,  – aka Madame Parboiled – charges £ for the three-hour tour of the city’s oldest pubs. First up is The Bell Innwith a hole still at the entrance, where lepers could buy their beers. Others on the route include the Ned Ludd and The Royal Children, so named because Charles II’s offspring would go there to play with the landlord’s kids. Final destination is the Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem, claiming to be the oldest pub in England, reputedly dating to . Few, however, know the story of the cursed galleon, an ancient model ship kept locked in an upper room.  Twice in the last  years, cleaners have decided to dust it but both died within days.Today, no one dares go near, including Madame Parboiled, who winds up the tour telling the story from the safety of a room downstairs.

The renovation involved turning the former five aposdormitory-likeapos staff accommodation into a single home, building two orangeries, replacing the windows, chimneys, staircases, and some high-tech upgrades around the house. The money comes from the Sovereign Grant, which was valued at £. million this year and comprised of profits from the Crown Estate. Itaposs believed the construction work to transform the property could cost in the region of £.m.  The Windsor and Maidenhead Borough Council reportedly approved plans for two orangeries at Frogmore Cottage last July. It is not knownthey have been built yet but itaposs estimated they will each cost between £, and £,. A royal source told Daily Mail: Natural light is important for the Sussexes as Meghan misses the LA sunshine. The construction works also included the installation of new water mains for high-pressure showers and the replumbing fee may run to £,. Another £, is said to have spent on installing an aposeco-boilerapos which supplies endless hot water and low-carbon heat.  The Grade-II listed property will have been rewired to enable the royal couple to control lighting, heating, open curtains and soundproof windows and activate CCTV through an app on their smartphones, according to the report. Itaposs believed Harry was keen on having a smart home and rewiring such a large property to accommodate this would have added around £, to the bill. Another source said a sound system has been installed through the cottage. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have paid roughly £, of their own money on the fixtures and fittings including aposfine furnishingsapos for a kitchen, living room and nursery for baby Archie. It has been widely reported that interior designer Vicky Charles was involved in the project and while her exact fees are unknown, top designers can charge around £ per day.  Meghan and Harry are also believed to be using vegan, chemical paint from Auro which costs £ for a five-litre tin. Extra costs included installing a aposfloating floorapos in the kitchen where timbers were laid over the old floor which builders werenapost allowed to remove. The kitchen is said to be state-of-the-art and with top notch appliances so the price tag could end up being £,. There are rumours that Meghan and Harry will have their own dressing rooms and their new en-suite comes with power shower, underfloor heating and marble-surround basins. Meghan is known for her love of fitness and plans for an outdoor tennis or badminton court are being discussed.  Sources claim the couple have installed an organic vegetable garden to grow their own herbs, fruits and vegetables. With the all-inclusive vegetable garden, the pair can easily cook home-grown produce. The source said: The Duchess also has a passion for cooking so it was suggested to include a small plot in the spacious garden where they can grow some of their own produce. The Daily Mail also reports taxpayers are paying a £, bill for security which includes the cost of  officers from the Met and Thames Valley Police guarding the property.

Mum-of-four Katie, , who scoffed sweets, biscuits and crisps between meals, struggled walking up the stairs and even a short walk tired her out. But now they have been named Slimming World’s Couple of the Year , less than  months after joining. Katie’s lightbulb moment came when their eldest daughter Rhiannon was about to turn .  She said: “It hit me that my children were becoming adults – and one day I might have grandchildren. “At the rate I was going, I knew that I wouldn’t be around to see them.” Katie, who has dropped from stone to st lbs, had been piling on the pounds for years: “I’d always been big but with every pregnancy I became bigger. Each was deemed high-risk because of my weight – so much so I needed a big luminous sticker on all my notes.” Hotelier Tony, , who has lost st  and a half lbs, said: “When Katie told me she didn’t think she’d be alive to see any of our grandchildren grow up, it shocked me into action.”    “I’d always been overweight. I grew up in a fish and chip shop so there was always fried food on the menu. “In fact, I used to get bored of eating fish and chips so developed a liking for deep fried pies. Now the pair from Bicester, Oxon, have swapped takeaways and creamy carbonaras for healthy dinners and snack on fresh fruit. Tony admits that his health has improved since losing weight, too. He says: “Before we lost the weight, we were barely active at all.On our family holidays we’d drive up to a beach, open the car doors and watch the kids play from the comfort of the car. Then we’d pack them all up again, drive a bit further up the coast and do the same again. I realise now that we weren’t enjoying the time with our children to the fullest. These days we run - miles a day with our two dogs and we’re full of energy – so active family days out are the norm for us now and we hope to be this fit and active for many more years to come.”  Vital Stats:Katie VineyAge:  Height: ft ½ins  .m Starting weight: st ½lbs ½lbs kg Current weight: st lbs lbs kg Weight loss: st ½lbs ½lbs kg Starting dress size:  Current dress size:  Date joined Slimming World: January Tony VineyAge:  Height: ft ins .m Starting weight: st lbs lbs kg Current weight: st ½lbs ½lbs kg Weight loss: st ½lbs ½lbs kg Starting waist measurement: ins cm Current waist measurement: ins cm Date joined Slimming World: January  Group: Katie and Tony attend the Bicester Slimming World group in Oxfordshire, run by Mandy Giraud.Katie’s before menu:Breakfast: Cereal and milk or a pain au chocolat Lunch: Sandwich, crisps and biscuits Dinner: Takeaway Snacks: Biscuits, crisps and sweets Evening: More snacking on biscuits, sweets and crispsKatie’s after menu:Breakfast: Porridge with mixed berries Mid-morning: Apple and banana fruit pot Lunch: Large homemade chicken salad Dinner: Beef stroganoff, goulash or stir-fry served with rice or veg Evening: Fresh fruit, fat-free yogurt, a Slimming World hi fibre barTony’s before menu:Breakfast: Small bowl of cereal with milk Lunch: A burger with bacon, cheese, mushrooms and black pudding Dinner: A takeaway or creamy carbonara with lots of cheese Snacks: Chocolate, biscuits and crisps Evening: More chocolate, biscuits and crispsTony’s after menu:Breakfast:  Weetabix with fruit and fat-free natural yogurt Mid-morning: Banana and an apple Lunch: Large homemade salad with tuna or chicken Dinner: Beef stroganoff, goulash or stir-fry served with rice or veg Evening: Fresh fruit, fat-free yogurt, sugar-free jellyVital Stats: Katie VineyAge:  Height: ft ½ins  .m Starting weight: st ½lbs ½lbs kgCurrent weight: st lbs lbs kg Weight loss: st ½lbs ½lbs kg Starting dress size:  Current dress size:  Date joined Slimming World: January Tony VineyAge:  Height: ft ins .m Starting weight: st lbs lbs kg Current weight: st ½lbs ½lbs kg Weight loss: st ½lbs ½lbs kg Starting waist measurement: ins cm Current waist measurement: ins cm Date joined Slimming World: January  Group: Katie and Tony attend the Bicester Slimming World group in Oxfordshire, run by Mandy Giraud.Katie’s before menu:Breakfast: Cereal and milk or a pain au chocolat Lunch: Sandwich, crisps and biscuits Dinner: Takeaway Snacks: Biscuits, crisps and sweetsEvening: More snacking on biscuits, sweets and crispsKatie’s after menu:Breakfast: Porridge with mixed berries Mid-morning: Apple and banana fruit pot Lunch: Large homemade chicken salad Dinner: Beef stroganoff, goulash or stir-fry served with rice or veg Evening: Fresh fruit, fat-free yogurt, a Slimming World hi fibre barTony’s before menu:Breakfast: Small bowl of cereal with milk Lunch: A burger with bacon, cheese, mushrooms and black pudding Dinner: A takeaway or creamy carbonara with lots of cheese Snacks: Chocolate, biscuits and crispsEvening: More chocolate, biscuits and crispsTony’s after menu:Breakfast:  Weetabix with fruit and fat-free natural yogurt Mid-morning: Banana and an apple Lunch: Large homemade salad with tuna or chicken Dinner: Beef stroganoff, goulash or stir-fry served with rice or veg Evening: Fresh fruit, fat-free yogurt, sugar-free jelly "},{"url":null,"title":"private school gets visit 20m","story":"NewsPrivate school gets visit from £m military helicopter at taxpayers expenseEXCLUSIVE: It is the second time that an expensive Merlin helicopter has visited the West London school in six yearsShareCommentsByNick Sommerlad:,  JUN NewsA military helicopter has made its second visit to a private school attended by the kids of a Royal Navy officer\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Royal Navy officer arranged for a £million military helicopter to visit pupils at the £,-a-year private school where his kids go.

After the recent visit, a resident said: “It seems a lot of taxpayers’ money is being spent on these trips for children at an expensive private school. “It does not seem right to me.” The helicopter landed in the park next to the school.

Ravenscourt Park Preparatory School in Hammersmith, West London, tweeted: “Amazing day had by P [on the] Merlin helicopter.”    The Ministry of Defence denied there was a cost to the taxpayer because the trip doubled as a training exercise. The MoD added: “To train effectively, military helicopters often use external landing sites so crews can practise operating in complex and unusual airfields and airspace. This particular training opportunity also enabled a community engagement event with a number of local primary schools.” But a defence source said these trips are often arranged by military mums and dads as a treat for their kids.

The young pair, their ages unknown, were pulled out from the water around  metres off shore and rushed to AE, reports Devon Live . A spokesperson for the Beer Coastguard Rescue Team said: One of our rescue officers was first on scene and conned Lyme leboat on to the two casualties and they quickly recovered them into the leboat. Both were cold and one had swallowed sea water.    It was decided to lower the paramedic from the helicopter onto the leboat to check them over. As it was too rough on the shore for the leboat to land, and due to their condition, it was decided to winch both into the helicopter and land on the beach where the HART team and doctor onboard the air ambulance could check them out. It was decided both needed to be taken to AE via land ambulance. We wish them a quick recovery. A witness told Devon Live: At approximately .pm this evening we noticed an RNLI leboat circling off Seaton seafront, then [RNLI] rescue helicopter arrived and made several attempts to winch people from the leboat.    The helicopter then put down on the end of Seaton beach and was met by two ambulances, coastguard and police and also the Devon Air Ambulance. Just heard it was two kids jumping off the sea wall and swept out to sea, both on the way to hospital. It is the latest in a string of incidents at sea in Devon. In the past two days around eight incidents have seen coastguard, paramedics and police respond with urgency. Yesterday a aposcritical incidentapos was declared around Torbay.

Police were called to the horrying scene after being contacted by a local worker in Polk County last Thursday. By the time officers arrived the gator had already let go but was still nearby, local news station WFLA reported. The Polk County Sherf’s Office told the station the man’s body was found in a canal at around : a.m. Officials from the Florida Fish and Wildle Conservation Commission responded to assist.    The gator was shot and killed by FWC and taken to the Medical Examiner’s Office along with the man’s body, officials said. They will now examine the contents of the alligator’s stomach. “It’s a large alligator. It was  foot,  inches long and it weighed approximately  pounds,” Ashley Tyer, Florida Fish  Wildle Conservation Commission, told the station. A Polk County Sherf’s Office spokesman added that it is possible the man died several days ago. The gator had “disengaged” from the body by the time officials responded, according to the sherf’s office. “The body does look like it had something happen to it related to the alligator,” Carrie Horstman, with PCSO told the channel.    “We’re really not at liberty to say much right now. It is possible that the alligator did something to this person either before or after his death.” Investigators do not have any information on the cause of death at this early stage, a sherf’s office spokesman said. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death, the man’s identity, and how long he was dead for. A vehicle was towed away from the scene. Law enforcement is working to determine why the man was on the property.

Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening. The staff were also fantastic, extremely helpful, attentive and polite."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.42206410-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.42206410-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.42206410-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.42206410-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"arthur rides 1000 miles from perth to germany in memory of tragic tayside girl harlow","story":"His bike is nowhere near as quick as the super sporty cars he looks after in Tayside as workshop controller at Porsche.But Arthur Booth nevertheless chose to use two wheels instead of four to ride the , miles from the Perth Porsche premises, which is part of the Peter Vardy Group, to the German company’s HQ in Stuttgart to raise money for a very worthy cause.The -year-old has raised nearly £, for the Harlow’s Helping Hand fund which has been set up in memory of Coupar Angus toddler Harlow Edwards who died after being knocked down by a car in the town in October .The fund helps bereaved parents who have lost young children by providing support for funeral and headstone costs.Arthur said: “It took me nine days to get there.“I set off from Perth to Whitley Bay on the north-east coast of England then went down to York and King’s Lynn.

But he will be doing his own programme for the next couple of weeks.“Then hopefully we can start to get Niall integrated.“I think Niall will have a chance to be in full training maybe a few days before the second leg.“It would probably be too much to expect Niall for the first leg, but you never know as he is doing well.”Aberdeen will definitely be without midfielder Stephen Gleeson for the games with RoPS as he is ruled out with a knee injury. Gleeson did not travel to Cork due to the injury sustained while carrying out his fitness programme in the close season before reporting back to Pittodrie.The Dons are still sweating over the fitness of Craig Bryson, the summer signing from Derby County, for the first leg with RoPS.Bryson is recovering from an ankle ligament injury.The injury ruled him out of Derby’s run to the Championship play-off final at Wembley, where they lost to Aston Villa in the final.The -year-old has stepped up his recuperation in Cork by beginning training on the grass.McInnes said: “Niall McGinn, Connor McLennan and Craig Bryson are still that bit behind and we are hoping we can get them up to speed and join the squad.“Once we can get those three back on to the pitch and fully training with the rest of us, the squad starts to look a bit stronger and a bit more how we would want it.”Aberdeen have ed to the Fota Island resort in Cork having utilised the facility during pre-season last summer in the build-up to facing Burnley.There is a key dference this summer, however, that is allowing McInnes to get maximum work into his squad – the temperature.The climate this week has been far more conducive to triple training sessions per day.Last year the Dons trained during the hottest summer in Cork for more than two decades.It was so hot an official weather warning was issued by the Met Eireann.Temperatures were in excess of C and Cork airport endured the driest conditions ever recorded.It is much cooler this summer and McInnes is making the most of the conditions.He said: “Last summer was very unusual with the temperatures.“Obviously that was a factor when we were trying to get the work into the players.“The reason we don’t really go to countries with those climates is because we are mindful that players are training twice a day, sometimes three times a day.“We have got to try to make sure the conditions are right for them.“Last season was a bit more dficult to get the work into them.“The weather is a bit more normal this year as it is pleasant.“The facilities in Cork are terric.“We have everything we need and catered for within the working week.“There are also two pitches of a very high standard, which is very important when you are trying to do as much pitch work as possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/F1-Singapore_18-19_COMP_03.jpg ","title":"f1 2019 review formula one has never looked so good","story":"The latest in official Formula One game is here, so grab your helmets, and jump in.As you#d expect from developers with such pedigree the sport has been treated with all the love, care and attention it deserves.Aside from the expected roster and car updates, F #s visuals have been upgraded massively compared to last year # and that was a beautul game in its own right.The biggest changes are the revamped lighting effects, which are most obvious during the night races in Singapore and Bahrain, and the new new rain effects, making the notoriously tricky conditions all the more pleasing to the eye when you spin off at mph.Jumping into the career mode will see you first racing in Formula , the feeder series were so many of the sport#s big names have cut their teeth.Acting almost like a tutorial these first few races will show you the ropes, introduce you to career rivals in Lukas Weber and Devon Butler, and influence the teams available to you when you do progress into the big leagues.After the season ending race you will be given the chance to pick from available contracts in Formula One # each team with their own season expectations and perks to contend with. vw, px\"  This relationship with your new team is affected by everything you do on the track, as well as your interactions with the press.

Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have. We are also inviting them to meet with us in person in Brussels and with our permanent staff in our Brussels office, the British Agriculture Bureau.Andrew McCornickMinette BattersJohn Daviesand Ivor Ferguson "},{"url":null,"title":"show us your mojo","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDon#t miss out on your chance to play on MOJO#s unique live stage on October  in Ardfern.Bands have only three weeks left to enter their demo on to MOJO organisers, so don#t delay to be part of this exclusive night of original live music.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal.

regions first Premier Inn.And now that developers have dropped controversial proposals to include a new supermarket, the plans are being given the thumbs up from David Parker.Mr Parker, who represents Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and secure existing jobs and undoubtedly lead to a tourism boost in the Scottish Borders.ldquoI look forward to this development receiving approval and work commencing on

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match. Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-turn-former-rbs-in-north-berwick-into-a-house","story":"The townrsquos Royal Bank of Scotlandclosed in June last year.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

And the federal government has a duty to protect the civil rights of all people. pic vMqzRrgmdash Joe BidenJune , Mr Biden has surged to the top of the Democratic pack arguing that he is best positioned to defeat President Donald Trump because he can build a broad coalition of support.Appearances such as the one with Mr Jackson, his one-time rival in the  Democratic presidential primary, will signal whether Mr Harrisrsquo attack will chip into his support among African Americans.He acknowledged the critical role of black voters and labour unions on Friday, saying: ldquoYrsquoall are the ones that brung me to the dance.Mr Biden pushed back against some of Harrisrsquo specic criticisms, including her argument that he once opposed bussing, a measure intended to alleviate racial segregation.He said he was more opposed to federal intervention in bussing than the practice itself.ldquoI never, never, never, ever opposed voluntary bussing, Mr Biden said, adding that he supported federal legislation to ldquoaddress root causes of segregation in our schools and that he was always ldquoin favour of using federal authority to overcome state-initiated segregation, even in bygone days when it was not popular.But even while defending his own record, Mr Biden still tempted controversy.He said he envisioned a society in which everyone realises the ldquokid in the hoodie might be the next poet laureate and not a gang-banger.The ldquogang-banger remark was a reminder of his loose and undisciplined approach to language and a tendency to say things that he doesnrsquot think will offend his generation but that conjure very dferent images among others, especially young Americans.Calornia lawyer Tom McInerney signed up to be on Mr Bidenrsquos national finance team but said he notied the campaign this month that he was withdrawing his support.He pointed to what he called repeated missteps, including Mr Bidenrsquos comments on segregationists and the former vice presidentrsquos recent reversal on the Hyde Amendment, a long-standing congressional ban on using federal health care money to pay for abortions.I am in Japan at the G-, representing our Country well, but I heard it was not a good day for Sleepy Joe or Crazy Bernie.

TrumpJune , His reversal, he now says he opposes the amendment, came after rivals and womenrsquos rights group blasted him for affirming through campaign aides that he still supported the decades-old budget provision.ldquoI have tremendous respect for the vice president. However, I just became increasingly troubled by his comments, Mr McInerney said.ldquoIt just seems like he wasnrsquot thinking this through.Mr Bidenrsquos campaign offered no immediate comment on Mr McInerneyrsquos withdrawal.Also during Fridayrsquos event, Mr Biden leaned heavily on being Barack Obamarsquos vice president, something he did not do as much during the debate, when Ms Harrisrsquo relentless criticism often left him flustered and seemingly unsure of what to say.ldquoMy president gets much too little credit for all that he did. He was one of the great presidents of the United States of America, and Irsquom tired of hearing about what he didnrsquot do, Mr Biden said of Mr Obama.Sylvia Chapman, , of Chicago, attended Mr Bidenrsquos speech and said Thursdayrsquos confrontation between Ms Harris and Mr Biden was ldquojust a few minutes of talk.ldquoYou have to look at the whole picture, not just one chapter out of a book, said Ms Chapman, who is black and is the president of a union local in Chicago.She said she was undecided about who to support in , but Mr Biden is among the top of her choices, along with Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ms Harris.Patricia Ousley, , a black retired state employee from the Chicago suburb of South Holland, cheered loudly when Mr Biden told the crowd Mr Obama does not get the credit he deserves.She said Mr Bidenrsquos experience working alongside Mr Obama is a big reason she may support him in : ldquoI love

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers.

Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : pmA revised pay offer from HIAL to air traffic control officershas been rejected, with industrial action to restart tomorrow, at six airports including Kirkwall Airport.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm.

This has been under constant review, some might say attack, since .#Commenting after the Coastguard Agency consultation meeting in Edinburgh yesterday, Thursday, on the future of emergency tug provision in the north of Scotland, Mr Carmichael said: “For the third time in nine years the Maritime Coastguard Agency is again consulting on future provision of emergency tugs and for the third time in nine years it looks like a botched job.“The consultants engaged by the MCA have been set tight and arbitrary deadlines. Today’s meeting in Edinburgh seems to be the last chance for input from outside government. I fully support the call made by Councillor Steven Coutts for an extension of the time for responses.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through.

This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The aim of the pilots was to reduce goose impacts by managing their numbers and by selling goose meat locally.SNH has said the studies confirmed that resident greylag goose populations can absorb substantial losses without any effect on their conservation status.The sale of the meat and funding have also been extended for the Western Isles.Sally Thomas, SNH’s Director of People  Nature, said: “Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We understand it’s still an issue in some areas, with a dficult balance between conservation, farming and hunting.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, by giving them the control to manage goose numbers sustainably through sport shooting, other control, or selling goose meat for profit.”The pilots are now being extended until the end of . The  transitional Challenge Fund will help local goose groups develop business models to generate income from the sale of resident greylag goose meat in the long term.SNH has also said that they and local goose management groups are also exploring other options together, such as more flexible licences when necessary, a review of bag limits in some areas, and egg-oiling.The pilot studies cost about £, over five years to March  and an additional £, to March .

If he becomes Prime Minister, Boris Johnson must not join the growing club of illiberal world leaders.Liberalism is “obsolete”, Donald Trump is a “talented person”, “traitors must be punished” and one of the benefits of the war in Syria is Russia now has battle-hardened soldiers.For those in any doubt about the true nature of Vladimir Putin and the growing threat to liberal democracy posed by the despotic Russian president and his fellow travellers around the world, then his interview with the Financial Times must surely be a wake-up call.As world leaders gathered for the G meeting in Japan, Putin had good reason to feel confident in making the claim that liberalism is dying out.Russia’s annexation of Crimea, its military support for rebels in eastern Ukraine, including the missile that shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane, the use of nerve agents in Salisbury, resulting in the death of local woman Dawn Sturgess but not the intended target, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, and other affronts to democracy, human rights and the rule of law have been met with little more than a few sanctions and meek acquiescence by the world’s democratic states. Appeasement is another word, heavy with history, that could be used.And so, in the manner of a naughty schoolboy who thinks he’s being clever, Putin, speaking about about Skripal’s attempted murder, told the FT that “traitors must be punished. I am not saying that the Salisbury incident is the way to do it ... but traitors must be punished”.: Russia is creating a new Cold War – leader comment: A denunciation of Donald Trump – leader comment: The UK needs Brexit rebels with a cause – leader commentTreating the situation as a joke is a sign Putin knows he will not face any real consequences, despite Theresa May’s weak call yesterday for Russia to end its “irresponsible and destabilising activity”. Fat chance.As expected, the meeting of Putin and Trump sparked an outbreak of bonhomie. “Don’t meddle in the election, please,” the US President said as he wagged a comedy finger at the grinning Putin. Perhaps still inwardly glowing from the praise for him in the FT interview, Trump said it was a “great honour” to be with Putin, adding that they had a “very, very good relationship”.Other people Trump has a good relationship with include Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. Given the latter’s regular attacks on the “liberal elite”, it’s pretty clear he’s a member of the “illiberal elite”.Johnson’s position, however, is less certain. He was a liberal internationalist when it was prudent to be one as London mayor, now he plays the hardcore Brexiteer.When casting their vote for party leader and therefore Prime Minister, Conservative members will need to guess what Johnson’s values actually are. Are they willing to take the chance that the leader of this country might soon, like Trump, be striking up the friendliest of relations with Putin If Brexit Britain joins the growing illiberal alliance around the world, it will only increase the isolation of the European Union as one of the last globally powerful bastions of liberal democracy, weakened from within as it is by far-right leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orban.And it was the EU’s President, Donald Tusk, who gave one of the strongest responses to Putin’s declaration of ideological victory.“Whoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete,” he said. “What I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs ...” But sadly, Tusk still felt the need to add, “... evensometimes they may seem effective”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why teachers really do deserve their long summer holiday kevan christie","story":"Teachers often work beyond their stated hours in a job many of us would not want to do, so we shouldn#t begrudge them time off during the summer break, writes Kevan Christie.“What’s the best thing about teaching ”“July and August!” – so the old joke goes.But as the schools split up and many teachers prepare to spend time with their own kids, busman’s holiday style, while catching up on their drinking, the time has come to ask: do they really deserve such a long break I’ll put you out your misery – a resounding yes is the answer. Andyou don’t agree, try standing up in front of  children, all wearing circulation restricitng black Superdry clothes, chewing gum and clutching their phones like a Catholic nun holding her rosary beads.Five days a week. Not many of us could handle it – having to perform to that level day in, day out. No scanning social media, no nipping out for a quick coffee and you can’t even go to the loo when you want. At this point, I must confess to knowing next to nothing about education as regular readers will attest, although I have a we and sister who are teachers and a dad who was a headmaster. I think you call them “Principals” now.: Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than others: Cameron Wyllie: Teachers now are better than the past’s ‘real characters’This was of mixed benefit to me growing up. On the plus side, it was great when faither brought home the school video recorder for six weeks or more in the summer holidays allowing my -year-old self and nine-year-old brother to catch up on classic slasher horror movies like The Hills of Eyes and Last House on the Left.And his school belt, the Lochgelly Tawse, was a handy weapon to threaten my brother with during our daily battles, while acting as a deterent against setting fire to the garden hut as I went through my childhood arsonist phase. As you do, boys will be boys.But he disappeared each Saturday morning to take his school football team and the regional Lothian Schools select team on a Sunday, all in the name of extracurricular activities.Then there were the endless hours he spent ‘timetabling’ classes for the whole school, before computers a seemingly impossible Krypton Factor-style pursuit that definitely helped him gain promotion.This week alone my we has spent two nights in a tent taking pupils on a camping trip and when I phoned my sister to ask her about teaching she was in France on a school excursion to the killing fields of World War One. This led to me phoning social services to complain about neglect but all I got was the engaged tone.Other teachers I have spoken to say that the working time agreement – setting aside  hours for collegiate activities like parents meetings and preparing course work over the  weeks of the school term – is nowhere near enough and they never get everything done. The reality is that hard-working teachers do a lot more than these hours and need time to have a le.Teachers often have to assume the role of social worker, police officer, doctor and de facto parents for children with troubled home lives. But who is looking after the growing number of teachers experiencing severe stress that impacts on their mental health and wellbeing All of this while under extreme scrutiny from the Scottish Government who have made education their number one focus, although their report card to date is certainly of the ‘must try harder’ iety.They certainly haven’t made the lives of teachers any easier with their Curriculum for Excellence and the ongoing recruitment crisis, reduction in subject choice and increase in multi-level classes in senior secondary schools.All of this against the backdrop of a poverty-related attainment gap that makes Nicola Sturgeon’s claims about making education a priority ring hollow.The recent hard-fought pay rise that works out at  per cent over three years – but needs a teacher to explain it to you properly – was a decent result.But too many Bright Young Things are choosing well-paid jobs in the private sector and someone with a much-valued maths degree will quickly go on to make a six-figure salary in the financial industry rather than -odd grand as a teacher in their first few years.“Aye, but they get loads of holidays” doesn’t really cut it and no-one goes into teaching for the money.The job seems like more of a vocation, an increasingly old-fashioned concept that harks back to gentler times when teachers were genuinely held in high-esteem.They were pillars of society, valued in the community and listened to by parents who accepted the teachers word over that of their kids. Not so now where the prevailing culture is to blame the teacherthe pupil doesn’t get straight As. We’ve come a long way from the ‘help the jannie class’ I remember from my school days at Leith Academy, where a single file of kids deemed to have ‘learning dficulties’ helped the janitor pick up litter from the playground.Either that or they got sent to something called ‘Theatre Arts’ that sounded way better than conventional lessons. Yip, that’s how we dealt with complex mental health issues back in the s.Outdoor pursuits for us was caneoing in Leith Docks – not the Water of Leith may I add – the actual docks, where we were up to our necks in sh***.Teachers are now called upon to cater for a wide-iety of pupils, many of whom require additional support in overcrowded classrooms all in the name of inclusion. There’s no punting them onto the janitor these days.Looking in from the outside, teaching unfortunately seems like one of those vital jobs like nursing and caring where the people who chose to do them because they want to help others are often treated shabbily.“They do it, so you don’t have to” is a mantra that could be applied to teaching.And, with this in mind, we shouldn’t begrudge them a single day of their holidays.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"botched public sector it contracts leave big black hole","story":"Repeated problems with IT contracts across the public sector in Scotland have cost the taxpayer more than # million in recent years, analysis has revealed.The botched implementation of upgraded computer systems across the police, NHS and other quangos has led to the public purse having to write off a total of £m, the Scottish Conservatives said.The Tories claimed it was proof SNP ministers had repeatedly failed to get a grip on handling contracts for vital IT systems relied on by thousands of public sector staff.A spokesman for finance secretary Derek Mackay said the Scottish Government had introduced a strengthened system for managing IT to ensure every project worth more than £m was subject to a comprehensive programme of technical assurance.It follows a report last week that found an IT project with no clear business case has left Scotland’s public sector pension body with a £m budget gap.The Auditor General for Scotland, Caroline Gardner, said the failed scheme had considerably set back planning at the Scottish Public Pensions Agency .The SPPA runs retirement plans for more than , people, including NHS employees, teachers, firefighters and police officers. The organisation’s planned IT scheme to integrate pensions’ administration and payments was meant to save cash and boost efficiency.The watchdog said the SPPA had awarded the IT contract to outsourcing firm Capita in  despite concerns that its bid was “abnormally low” in terms of overall costs.The agency also said the body had set an “unrealistic” -month timescale for the completion of the project, which was supposed to save it money by integrating pensions’ administration and payments.The project was shut down in February last year after Capita failed to deliver a working IT system or hit any of its key milestones.But the Tories said it was just one of several similar incidents that had left taxpayers out of pocket.They pointed to long-term issues with CAP payments for farmers, which saw costs balloon from £m to £m – costing taxpayers an additional £m.The party added that plans to sort out NHS ’s IT system saw a £.m process turn into an expected £m – an extra £.m.And Police Scotland’s new computer system has come in £m more than initially planned, now totalling £m.Scottish Conservative MSP Donald Cameron said: “It would be unrealistic to expect every major IT project to be completed on time and on budget, especially when large organisations are involved. “But the fact this series of blunders has cost the taxpayer more than £m shows just how negligent the SNP has been.“Nationalist ministers have spent years pleading poverty – slashing public services and hiking taxes as a consequence.“But a more competent approach to these schemes could have saved the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds and spared some of the subsequent misery.“The SNP cannot blame anyone  for this record of financial recklessness.“It’s been in charge for  years and must take full responsibility.”Mike Rumbles, the Scottish Lib Dems’ connectivity spokesman, said: “Too many SNP IT projects have been allowed to spiral out of control. “From policing to farming payments, too often these projects have become a black hole for money and staff time and do not delivered the benefits promised.”A spokesman for Mr Mackay told The Scotsman: “We will take no lectures from a Tory party responsible for Chris Grayling’s phantom ferries fiasco, which wasted £m of public cash – and which comes on top of more than £ billion more in wasted funds on his watch.“There have also been a litany of IT failures under successive UK governments, including the Tories’ scrapping of the NHS’s national electronic health record system after spending at least £.bn.“The Scottish Government has introduced a new and strengthened system for managing IT to ensure every project worth more than £m is subject to a comprehensive programme of technical assurance.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view.

Lavishly staged by a professional creative team, this stirring Grand Opera House Summer Youth Production is the most ambitious to date, bringing together  of Northern Ireland’s creatives. Supported by a -piece orchestra, the impressive score will feature all the big numbers including I Still Believe, The Movie in my Mind and the iconic The American Dream.-year-old Aquinas pupil Lára Mulgrew will perform the role of Ellen in the stage show. No stranger to the Grand Opera House stage, Lára performed aged nine the role of Molly in their production of Annie. Lára described the audition process “as very straight forward” and how it will be “wonderful” to portray the role of Ellen come July.“I hadn’t seen the production before but was able to watch it on Youtube. It’s going to be a total of six performances and it’s a very mature role,” she said. “It’s definitely the most challenging role I’ve ever had to perform and it will be a great challenge to take on her maturity.”Methody College’s Louis Fitzpatrick will take on the role of American GI John Thomas, part of the battalion deployed in Saigon during the Vietnam War.“I heard about the auditions for Miss Saigon through a friend, I went for one audition and did well enough to get a call back. I was really ecstatic to learn I had got the part as I was performing Footloose at the time as part of the Belfast Youth and Drama Society, I joined in April  and the first production I did was Les Misérables.“I hadn’t watched the stage version before but was able to watch it on Amazon Prime.”The -year-old has just completed his A’levels in Moving Image, Politics and Drama and told the South Belfast News how he hopes to go on to study film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.Grand Opera House Chief Executive Ian Wilson added: “This is the ninth year that the Grand Opera House has staged its Summer Youth Production, and Miss Saigon® School Edition will be the biggest so far. It’s very rare for a theatre the size of the Grand Opera House to be granted the rights to the youth version, so it really is a brilliant opportunity to see the best up-and-coming musical theatre stars in one of the most popular musicals of all time.”For ticket information visit: www.goh"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"how divine mercy is local turning lives around","story":"FOUNDED in , the Divine Mercy group continues to go from strength to strength.Four years on, the group attracts weekly attendances of up to  people every Friday afternoon at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street.The worship group helps those suffering with suicidalthoughts and addictions, using faith as a form of help.Thomas Stewart, who helped set up the group, explained more about the work the group does.“I set up the group with a friend, who  years ago lost his brother who took his own le through suicide,” he said.“It was a total shock to his family and he felt he needed to do something to help others with similar problems.“We started the Divine Mercy group up in  and it was just three of us. It is a time to reflect on le, listen to beautul songs, and a prayer session is also available afterwards for those who wish to get involved in that.“I think with the issues of addictions with drugs and alcohol becoming more of an issue in North Belfast, the Divine Mercy group offers something dferent to anyone who is seeking help.“Whatever is going on in your own le or your family’s le,your son or daughter is suicidal or has addiction problems, I would encourage you to come along to the Divine Mercy group.“There is help available, which is why people come back. It’s an outlet for people also and a comfort zone for them. The Divine Mercy gives these people hope.“There are young lads coming here who are broken in their lives. The reason we can draw them in is because we are all from dferent backgrounds and we are able to reach out to them.”One of the great successes of the Divine Mercy group has been the regular Cursillo residential weekends in Benburb.The Cursillo runs from a Thursday evening to a Sunday afternoon with participants able to meet people and explore their faith further in a serene and spiritual environment.Hugh Byrne, another key figure in the Divine Mercy group, said the Cursillo is a le-changing experience for those involved.“After three days, they are dferent people. It is truly a le-changing experience and I have seen that with people over the years.”Hugh is also responsible for talking to anyone who comes to the Divine Mercy group in order to offer help and advice.“I sit and have a chat with the lads every week,” he added.“If I get them to listen, that is the start. If we help turn one person’s le around, that is better than none.“I ask them how far they are in their addiction whether it would be alcohol or drugs.“Some people have fallen away but there have been a lot of successes. Relationships and marriages have been fixed and people have turned their lives around.“We also have good links with rehabilitation services and other helplines to point people towards further help.”At last Friday’s meeting, the group were joined by some American visitors who ed to Belfast a year on from experiencing the Divine Mercy group for the first time.Thomas says the success of the group has been extremely encouraging and a sign that they are on the right path.“It was great to see the visitors from the USA who were here last year and wanted to come back over again,” continued.“They are going back to spread the word about the work the group does.“The group can only get better. We started with just three people so we have come a long away in quite a short time.“People are coming back so we must be doing something right.“We have the prayers and so on and then we come out and sit and have tea, coffee and biscuits. It is great to see everyone bonding and talking to each other.“People don’t realise how powerful the Divine Mercy is. It doesn’t matter what is going on in your le.

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland.

There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"nodeal brexit would have severe impact on trade between dublin and holyhead","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum.

We will be judged by history on how we act in the next few years.”In the margins of the summit, Mrs May had a -minute meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman and raised the case of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The US intelligence community has concluded that the crown prince directed the killing of the Washington Post columnist at the Saudi consulate in Turkey last year.“On accountability for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi the Prime Minister said the legal process needed to be open and transparent,” the British official said."},{"url":null,"title":"new whale trail to connect more than 30","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I asked the Chancellor about recent speculation regarding means testing and there was a definitive answer:“The Confidence and Supply Agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party sets out that there will be no change to the universal nature of the Winter Fuel Payment.”He continued: “This is a clear and specic confirmation relating to just one element of what the DUP has already secured through the Confidence and Supply Agreement. It is also a reminder that this agreement was not designed to deliver for sectional interests, but for everyone in our society and applies both in Northern Ireland and right across the whole of the United Kingdom.“Older people in particular should take heart from this statement. DUP MPs will continue to support such universal benefits and fight on behalf of everyone.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"derry muslim community makes generous donation foyle foodbank","story":"Members of the Muslim community in Derry yesterday handed over a cheque to Foyle Foodbank which was raised through fasting during Ramadan.The money generously donated by the Northwest Islamic Association will provide emergency food supplies for local people in crisis.Zahid Bahli, Chairperson of the NW Islamic Association explained that Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting , prayer, reflection and community.However, few may know that it is also the month in which the Muslim community donates in abundance to charity, he said.In addition to the financial aspect of giving there is emotional strand of Ramadan which is realising the feeling of hungry human beings.Mr Bahli explained: “There are so many people in the world who couldn’t get the food to feed them and have to sleep hungry. One will not understand this feelinghe is not hungry or thirsty themselves.“The Muslim community in the city has merged these two principles together to raise donation for the people who need food to feed their families.“There is no better time to run this campaign than the month of Ramadan and there is no better local charity to support this good cause than Foyle Foodbank.“We are collaborating with Foyle Foodbank third year in a row for Ramadan fasting challenge. We managed to raise £, first year, £, second year and £, this year with our Ramadan charity fasting challenge donation project.”Foyle Foodbank manager James McMenamin thanked the NW Islamic Association for their continued support.“There has been a steady increase in the amount of money they have donated each year. This enables us to buy food that we’re running low on and will also help with teaching courses in debt management.”InclusionEach year in the month of Ramadan the North West Islamic Association invites members of the local community to take part in a fasting challenge where participants fast for a few hours up to full day depending upon their capability and preference.Families, friends and colleagues sponsor the participants by donating money.“At North West Islamic community centre we also run this donation appeal and set up donation box as well. Most of the people from Muslim community who attend for prayer and other events put money in this box to support this campaign as well in addition to show support for the participants,” Mr Bahli said.“The most impressive thing is that kids at the Islamic community centre break their kitty boxes to participate in this campaign.“All the participants are invited to join the Muslim community at the time of breaking the fast in Islamic community centre on the day of the challenge. There are a selection of dishes prepared for this day by the Muslim families from dferent countries“This project strengthens the bonds between communities and helps to know each other and to understand ious cultures and traditions in a multicultural environment. There is great sense of friendship, building bridges and sense of inclusion amongst the communities.”He concluded: “These types of projects are vital in a society to promote combined efforts for a good cause and aims which are beyond race, religion and nationality.“North West Islamic association is grateful to the participants of the challenge this year and also to the people who have donated money for this great cause this year and years before and for support in future.

Mr Cooper himself believed that the events of that day  years ago irretrievably changed the course of history in Northern Ireland.Another stalwart of the Civil Rights era in Derry, Dermie McClenaghan said: “Ivan was one of the most courageous people I have ever known. In the context of the Civil Rights struggle in the north, to say that he went out on a limb is hardly enough.”A Book of Condolence in honour of Ivan Cooper was also opened at the Guildhall yesterday by Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle.Ivan Cooper’s funeral service will take place at St Peter’s Church of Ireland tomorrow at noon and his remains will be interred at Altnagelvin Cemetery afterwards.Mr Cooper is survived by his we Frances, daughters Sinead and Bronagh, son-in-law Conor and grandchildren Cashel and Luca.Ivan Cooper hailed from Kilaloo near to village of Claudy in County Derry just a few miles from the city. Born into a working-class Protestant family in January , Mr Cooper’s family moved to Derry’s Bogside when he was around -years-old.He was briefly a member of the Claudy Young Unionist Association, but in April of  he joined the Northern Ireland Labour Party .His first foray into electoral politics also came in  when he stood as a NILP candidate at the Stormont general election. Although he attracted a good degree of cross community support, he wasn’t elected.Ivan Cooper’s lelong commitment to non-violence as a political methodology made him a natural character to fit within the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association .

One of his first major public pronouncements came in the summer of that year and characterised the fundamental principles of the entire movement.At a protest meeting in the foyer of the Guildhall he said that Protestants and Catholics should stand up for their rights together “as the blacks in America were fighting.”The unication of people away from their religious denominations would remain the dominant feature of Ivan Cooper’s political activism throughout his  years. He was convinced that both communities in Northern Ireland could work together for common goals. However, some within the Protestant and unionist community viewed this stance as nationalist in outlook and tainted him as a traitor.Nevertheless, Ivan Cooper continued his agitation based on the Civil Rights  and after the RUC attack on the October  march in , he ignored a month-long Stormont government ban on parades in Derry.However, following violence after a number of marches in the city, Cooper called for an end to spontaneous demonstrations. As confrontations between demonstrators and the RUC continued to escalate in early  after a People’s Democracy march was attacked at Burntollet, residents of the Bogside cordoned the area off with barricades.Whilst Ivan Cooper managed to persuade locals to dismantle the barriers, the chances of redeeming an already tense political situation had probably already gone. As the sectarianism he had fought so hard to keep at bay crept steadily back into the issues at hand, most Protestant people who had supported NICRA backed away from the movement.At the Northern Ireland general election of , Cooper was elected as an Independent MP for Mid-Derry and in doing so unseated the sitting Nationalist Party representative Paddy Gormley.The Battle of the Bogside began on August ,  after violence erupted following the annual Relief of Derry parade by the Apprentice Boys.As the first of three days of fighting grew increasingly heavy, Cooper attempted to restrain rioters by linking arms with Eddie McAteer and John Hume. As the trio were swept aside by the advancing crowd, Cooper was knocked unconscious by a brick.In August , Ivan Cooper became one of the founding members of the SDLP with John Hume, Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt. After Stormont was prorogued in , he was again elected as one of the representatives from Mid Ulster to the Northern Ireland Assembly in . After the power sharing administration tumbled in the face of the Ulster Workers Council Strike in , Cooper was again elected to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in .He was also the SDLP candidate for the constituency at both Westminster elections in . In the first one in February that year, he succeeded in splitting the nationalist vote and as a result caused the defeat of Independent MP Bernadette McAliskey.After boundary changes created the Foyle constituency in , Cooper stood aside to let John Hume have a clear run at claiming the seat. After this point, the overall political situation characterised as it was by ever increasing levels of violence, saw Ivan Cooper gradually withdraw from politics and concentrate more on his accountancy work."},{"url":null,"title":"temperatures sore ensure pets stay cool","story":"With temperatures predicted to go as high as  degrees today, dog owners are being urged to pay extra attention to their pets.The RSPCA says it receives many enquiries and reports about the welfare of animals over the summer months, particularly when its very hot.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

We made three or four goal chances, we scored one and we missed a number of kickable scores and frees, Tally said.ldquoThe players, though, gave all they had and never gave up on it. Ultimately, against a team like Mayo,you are not clinical you will come up that bit short.Over in Fr Lynch Park in Ballyholland, Down camogs won a hard-hitting encounter with a talented Laois side.Down held a - to - interval lead and then withstood a concerted second half fightback from their visitors, but the Ulster champions did enough to get over the line in a robust and competitive clash.Down now entertain Carlow on July  or ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Special event marking 10th anniversary of new Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospital is  years old.A special event to mark the occasion takes place at the main foyer at the Struell Road facility this Friday at pm, with the birthday celebration attended by past and present staff.Ahead of the event, South Down MLA Colin McGrath has paid tribute to all the staff who work at the hospital and the excellent service they provide.He also described the hospitalrsquos past decade as a ldquorollercoaster which featured many highs and many lows.ldquoThe one constant has been the high quality of care offered at the Downe from a range of health care practitioners and the all-important support and wrap-round staff, said Mr McGrath.But the Assemblyman said he and many others are keen to see theof the hospitalrsquos -hour AE service and dedicated coronary care unit.He said people also have concerns about the loss of the Downersquos coffee shop, praising the the GP out-of-hours service which he believes is a model which could be successfully replicated in other areas.ldquoThis is an exemplary unit and everyone who uses it is happy, he continued. ldquoAdditional regional clinics, including ophthalmology, are now delivered in Downpatrick which has helped generate increased footfall.

The appointment of a CEO was a strategic goal which would allow the organisation to grow and fulfil its members’ needs and aspirations. “We have held an exhaustive recruitment and interview process for this role and the unanimous verdict of the selection committee was that Simon Hamilton was the strongest candidate..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p  “Simon comes with a wealth of skills and experience. He trained and worked as an accountant, and he served as Economy Minister and Minister of Finance and Personnel. This background brings an unrivalled insight into the needs of business in our city and the wider economy.“Simon is stepping down completely both from frontline politics and from political le. Belfast Chamber is an apolitical organisation and will continue to be so.“We look forward to welcoming Simon into Belfast Chamber and working together to fulfilling our strategic aims on behalf of our members to make Belfast a business-friendly city that is a great place to work and live in and to visit.”Simon Hamilton commented: ‘After more than  years in the Northern Ireland Assembly, I will be standing down as an MLA for the Strangford constituency in the coming weeks and step away from politics completely to take up post as Chief Executive of Belfast Chamber.“I am very excited by this tremendous opportunity to support Belfast Chamber members and work with the wider business community, with whom I share the aim of continuing to transform and regenerate our capital into the vibrant and bustling city we all know it can be. “This stimulating new role allows me to pursue my passion for growing our economy and I look forward to working with the City Council, all of our political parties, government and its agencies as well as business, to create opportunities for people across our community.The work of the Belfast Chamber is apolitical, and I look forward to working with members and stakeholders in a completely non-partisan fashion. “I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in public service. Whether in Ards Borough Council or in the Northern Ireland Assembly, it has been a huge honour to represent all of the people of my home constituency. Since first being elected to the Assembly in , I have been privileged to hold three ministerial portfolios and to have been involved in so many policy initiatives that have made a positive dference to people’s lives.I will always be deeply indebted to the Party for the trust placed in me and the wonderful opportunities that responsibility has afforded me.I wish Arlene and all my former colleagues at Stormont well, especially in their ongoing efforts to restore the Assembly and restore devolved government which is the best way forward for everyone in Northern Ireland.“After being involved in politics in one way or another for almost  years, now is the time to contribute to the place I love in a dferent way. I now look forward to working with a new constituency, that of Belfast Chamber’s members. Belfast is the beating heart of Northern Ireland.When the city does well, the whole region does well.Even after the signicant strides forward that Belfast has taken over the last decade and more, it still has so much unfulfilled potential.”Mr Hamilton concluded: “The chance to represent such a broad range of businesses located across the entirety of the city is exceptionally exciting and I really look forward to helping the members to realise their ambitious vision for their businesses and for the city.”Tributes for Willie Frazer: campaigner for victims of terrorism dies, aged  Coremetrics

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was created as a buffer at the end of the - Korean War, and is jointly overseen by the American-led UN Command and North Korea.Hundreds of thousands of North and South Korean troops are now deployed along the DMZ, which is littered with an estimated two million mines, tank traps, razor wire fences and guard posts.Itrsquos extremely rare for anyone to cross the DMZ in unauthorised areas. More than , North Koreans have escaped to South Korea for political and economic reasons since the warrsquos end, but mostly via the Northrsquos long, porous border with China. -- vw,vw,px, px\"North Korean soldiers attack UN Command personnel at the truce village of Panmunjom  --Violence was more common during the Cold War, but a  land mine blast blamed on North Korea maimed two South Korean soldiers and pushed the rival Koreas to the brink of an armed conflict.As relations improved last year, Mr Kim and Mr Moon agreed on several deals aimed at reducing animosity at the border.They removed mines from certain areas, dismantled some of their guard posts and halted frontline live-fire exercises.Experts say tensions could easily diplomacy eventually fails to end the North Korean nuclear stalemate.PanmunjomIf Mr Trump is going to meet Mr Kim inside the DMZ, Panmunjom is the most likely place.It has been the venue for past high-level talks it is somewhat safer than other areas, and it is just an hourrsquos drive from Seoul, where Mr Trump will meet Mr Moon. -- vw,vw,px, px\"US President George W Bush visits Observation Point Ouellette in the DMZ  --Most past DMZ visits by US presidents and other officials happened at Panmunjom and nearby areas.North and South Korean troops stand just yards away from each other there.

That armistice has yet to be replaced with a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula in a technical state of war.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
