Like a once cocksure prime minister, the sausages and worms of freshly shaped clay that open the show seem crestfallen. Long reddish-brown tubes are stacked up like dead fish. A clay salami has been chopped into slices. Look out for this artist and her knife.Maiolino is a surrealist who finds the inner secrets of physical existence, while seducing the senses with frolicking lines and supple surfaces. Her subjugated willies are just the half of it. While snakes and chipolatas flop about uselessly, very vaginal-looking orifices lead the mind into hidden places. A series of sculptures made last year resemble cross-sections of a landscape that has been pockmarked and excavated by tiny tunnellers. Caverns open in the earth and lead to underground cities you can’t help trying to see into. These messy subterranean networks are halfway between a termite colony and a lost South American civilisation.Black Hole, a hypnotic, wall-mounted masterpiece made in 1974, has five sheets of thick black paper held in a square frame with small spaces between them. All except the last have circles of diminishing sizes cut out of them so you look into a stepped pit, like the descending circles of hell in Dante’s Inferno. The combination of precise calm and apocalyptic darkness is tense and compelling. This black hole sucks you in.Another void opens in a bigger black picture that Maiolino first made in 1973. This time, the lightless surface of a large painted wood panel has the shape of the South American continent cut out of it. Beyond is another layer of darkness. It is called Geographic Situation: Black Soul of Latin America. But Maiolino’s organic play is not just whimsy. Born in Italy in 1942, she has lived in Brazil since she was 18 – the country where she settled succumbed to military dictatorship in 1964 and did not get a democracy again until the 1980s. Today, its far-right elected president Jair Bolsonaro is openly nostalgic for authoritarian rule – so there’s an urgency to this retrospective of an artist who bravely protested against dictatorship in the 1970s.Maiolino wasn’t afraid to satirise military rule directly in woodcuts that echo the early 20th-century graphic art of Mexico’s José Guadalupe Posada. Her Posada-like 1966 print The Hero depicts a black-uniformed general whose face is an empty-eyed skull. This is art made not against a loudmouthed, 21st-century populist but an actual authoritarian regime that tortured and murdered dissidents.Yet Maiolino is much more than a cartoonist. Her art undermines authoritarian rule in a similar way to Guillermo del Toro’s horror film about the Franco era, Pan’s Labyrinth – by revealing an underground world of dreams and monsters undreamt of in fascist philosophy. Her art is one great splurge of freedom. Drip paintings evoke the fluid art of Jackson Pollock – but Maiolino’s drips go in contradictory directions, forcing you to try to work out how she constructed these networks of flowing colour.Her drawings, too, create intricate yet always-moving interconnections and flows. In fact, her art creates its own secret reality with a structure that pulls you in, only to resist interpretation. She even shows a series of calligraphic drawings that resemble a lost alphabet. It could be the language of her hidden cities, the forgotten pictogram script of the mysterious civilisation that excavated her tunnels where hope is born in primal darkness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe04a233cb9cf5e2d78cb5f937c4f3e6fef53a28/0_935_2953_1770/master/2953.jpg?width=980\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0a747e818b6902ee7951f17a11a8e96 980w","title":"secreted history what happened to donna tartt women","story":"Her novels do not fail the Bechdel test, and her women are not without nuance. But they are obscured by unreliable male narratorsOnly two women get any real page space in Donna Tartt’s debut The Secret History: Camilla Macaulay, the ethereal yet steely sole female member of the novel’s core friendship circle and Judy Poovey, the vulgar and brash Californian with a crush on the novel’s narrator, Richard Papen. The two seem to come from different planets. Camilla is cool, intelligent, untouchable, beautiful Judy has “wild clothes, frosted hair, and a red Corvette with California plates bearing the legend JUDY P” as well as a voice “which rang through the house like the cries of some terrifying tropical bird”.For a while, I played a game with the rest of Tartt’s female characters that goes: Camilla or Judy? The Goldfinch’s narrator Theodore Decker’s unrequited love, Pippa, is a Camilla, as is his mother Audrey background girlfriends Xandra and Kotku are Judys. It’s strangely easy to fit every woman into these two categories, as though there are only two ways to be a woman.The scarcity and restraint of female characters in Tartt’s novels is frustrating, even to super-fans like myself. Where Theo grows up in real time in The Goldfinch and Richard gets to anxiously navigate both college experience and murder plot in The Secret History, Tartt’s only female main character – Harriet Dufresnes, the 12-year-old heroine of The Little Friend – is forever stalled in time, dreading a womanhood that never arrives.Her youth allows her to escape the Camilla-Judy classification system, and it’s hard to imagine her growing up into either. She’s too dour to be a Camilla, too curious and clever to be a Judy. But what seems at first a more nuanced version of femininity is quickly subsumed into a wider disgust at adult womanhood Harriet fears adolescence, especially the “horrifying new indignity of being classed … a ‘Teen Girl’: a creature without mind, wholly protuberance and excretion”.The other women in The Little Friend are defined strictly in opposition to Harriet, and found lacking. Harriet’s older sister Allison is a “mild, gentle girl”, unlike Harriet the “bright-eyed tiger cub”. “There were plenty of girls at school prettier than Harriet, and nicer,” Harriet’s best friend Hely (a boy) thinks. “But none of them were as smart, or as brave.” The teenage girls at Harriet’s summer camp are filthy in their visceral physicality and stupid to boot: “Their conversation (the Bay City Rollers the Osmonds some boy named Jay Jackson who went to their school) bored and irritated her.” Harriet’s only hope is to hold on to her fierce sense of interiority and selfhood even as her teen years begin, but we never know if she succeeds. The novel ends before she has to try.Given Tartt’s skill in writing friendships, it is remarkable that there are no real friendships between women in any of her three novels. Camilla is the only girl in The Secret History’s gang Kitsey’s friendships with other women in The Goldfinch are alluded to without description in The Little Friend, Harriet’s only friend is a boy who can barely keep up with her.It’s easy to condemn Tartt for the lack of women in her work. It may pass the Bechdel test on technicalities – Judy Poovey talks to friends in The Secret History there is a mother-daughter conversation in The Goldfinch – but the Bechdel test’s ultimate goal of substantial representation cannot be satisfied by her novels. Women rarely speak, plot or work together, nor even fight or love one another. But our immediate attraction towards a particular kind of feminist impulse will lead us down the wrong avenues when it comes to Tartt, because in fact every one of her women is rich, dangerous and complex. The problem is that they can’t be touched.The great pleasure and privilege of Tartt’s first-person perspective is its all-encompassing immersion notably, her one book led by a female character, The Little Friend, is told in third person. But part of that immersion involves a wilful blindness to the interiority of women. In a conversation with Camilla in The Secret History, Richard looks “at the side of her face, listening to the sweet, throaty cadences of her voice, when I was jolted from my musing by a sharp exclamation”. It’s almost funny: he’s not listening to her at all! Camilla is an unsatisfying, insubstantial ghost because Richard has no interest in what lies underneath her physical allure she is “the real mystery, the safe I could never crack”.Resisting the psychological pull of these unreliable narrators allows us glimpses of strange, complicated women Tartt knows down to their bones. Judy is kind and generous even with her parrot voice she takes care of Richard, offers advice and is revealed in the epilogue to be one of the more successful graduates of their college. Pippa has a life full of trauma that Theo actively avoids thinking about, while Xandra, his apparently ditzy stepmother, is one of the few people in The Goldfinch who knows exactly what he’s doing she just has no interest in intervening.It’s obviously Tartt’s narrators who are shallow when it comes to the women they meet, not the women themselves. But this means that we never get to wade into those waters either. We watch their turbulent seas from over the clifftop, permitted to glimpse but not to enter. In this context, Harriet becomes less a determined outsider to the ranks of women and more a tragedy waiting to happen, her perspective about to be immolated.At the same time, it is both undeniable and exhausting that if Camilla were the hero of The Secret History or Pippa the star of The Goldfinch, the novels would be very different, because women don’t move in the world the same way men do. Theo stumbles into the world of underground gangsters Richard spends a winter nearly freezing to death. Their lives aren’t easy, wrestling with trauma, class, loss and grief. But if they were women, there would be an additional layer of disadvantage they would have had to fight through just to tell the story in the first place. Perhaps they would have compensated by becoming “hard or quarrelsome”, as Richard worries about Camilla. Tartt’s characters are often working against a very ancient idea of fate, a dark thread set out for them to follow that they cannot ide themselves from. Undoubtedly, her clean, masterful novels would clutter quickly if you added the structural forces of misogyny alongside the ine.All the same, sometimes I wonder about the Tartt heroines we could have had. What if The Secret History was about five feral girls and their token boy instead, drinking gin straight and lying to the FBI in white linen and pince-nez, translating Greek to Latin and chasing after Dionysian mysteries? What if a female Theo Decker lost her mother too young and became a charming, girlish liar with an opiate addiction, a tendency towards panic attacks, and a sexily complicated relationship with her criminal best friend?Given the deeply thrumming awareness of women and narrative possibility that guides Tartt’s work, it’s hard to feel particularly worried. She produces a novel once every decade. I have hope for a heroine yet.• The Goldfinch is released on 27 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00f3bc5cdf64be60152a76c01a9dada92ffa3c89/0_233_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75b8b2a94f688a7e4114f64955c48a6b","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s open with a bang, as safereturndoubtful recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin:Smonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It’s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other’s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning… Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre.Death in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired Kincaid to make a “major shout-out for the British Library’s crime series”:Just a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when.My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over jimitron5000:There were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn’t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read.JG Farrell’s Singapore Grip is “marvellous, as you would expect from this author,” writes SydneyH:The main thing I’ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it – though there obviously wasn’t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America’s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn’t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn’t quite as satisfying as Troubles, it’s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished.Pseudaletia is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass:… A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has ‘taken’. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I’m not far enough into it to talk about it’s meaning, etc, but so far it’s entertaining and thoughtful.We Don’t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over pubbore:A lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful.Vasily Grossman’s Stalingrad is “very long” says paulburns, but that “doesn’t matter”:It’s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read Life and Fate ) and various iniduals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I’m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear.Finally, Vesca has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark:It’s not as dark than others of hers I’ve read, which may be because it’s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there’s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who is Robinson?Now I want to know too.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Overall, payments at the end of the term are higher.“History tells us that companies with high debt repayment obligations, particularly those involving PIK notes, can get into real trouble in a market downturn if earnings are hit and they struggle to service the debt,” Mould said.Aston Martin said it needed the funds to carry out a plan to produce seven new models in as many years. The carmaker will also use the money to pay off short-term debts and cover transaction costs.Standard \u0026amp Poor’s, a debt-rating agency, cut its rating on Aston Martin deeper into non-investment, or “junk”, territory after the bond issue. S\u0026ampP downgraded Aston Martin to CCC+ from B- with a negative outlook, saying it had reached the limit of debt and interest it could repay.S\u0026ampP said the negative outlook reflected the company’s high debt and spending as it faced the risks of a no-deal Brexit and new tariffs on US exports. “In addition, AML is about to launch its new DBX luxury SUV, the success of which is critical to its ambitious growth strategy and ongoing creditworthiness,” the agency said.The “second century” plan launched by Aston Martin’s chief executive, Andy Palmer, has struggled to get out of first gear.The company has faced rising costs, supply chain issues and a sales slump. It made a £79m loss in the six months to the end of June, compared with a £21m profit in the same period a year earlier.Aston Martin has blamed economic uncertainty and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit for poor sales in the UK and Europe. The carmaker’s market value has plunged from £4.3bn, when it floated on the stock exchange last October, to about £1.2bn as concerns about its losses have mounted.Aston Martin said the DBX, its first sports utility vehicle, was on schedule and had been well received at Monterey car week in August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d56ba4e78b7600421148ce6ecfcaf7706ca8560d/56_0_4939_2963/master/4939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef73ffe0876d948c8a7aa7a8fbfd96c4","title":"germany condor thomas cook subsidiary lifeline","story":"Frankfurt-based airline Condor offered bridging loan after collapse of parent company Condor will continue to take to the skies after the German state shielded the airline from the demise of its parent company Thomas Cook with a €380m bridging loan.The sum, provided by the federal government and the state of Hesse where the firm is based, must first be approved by the European commission’s competition watchdog.Condor’s chief executive, Ralf Teckentrup, said the intervention on Tuesday was justified because the airline had a strong track record of profitability.Founded in 1955, the Frankfurt-based carrier holds a nostalgic value for many older Germans who associate its name with the newfound freedom of the postwar boom years.Der Spiegel magazine this week described the carrier as “part of the inventory of the old federal republic, like the Volkswagen Beetle”.Condor, which was gradually sold by Lufthansa to Thomas Cook in 2000-09, operates a larger fleet thanThomas Cook, with 58 planes in operation.The bailout has been criticised by the pro-business Free Democratic party and the German taxpayers’ association, which argued most of Condor’s passengers were insured through their travel agency and would not have been left in the lurch.In Britain, Boris Johnson ruled out a state rescue for Thomas Cook, saying it would created a “moral hazard” in future cases of companies on the brink.Condor’s plea for state support followed the recent bailout of Air Berlin. The government pledged a €150m loan to help the low-cost carrier in August 2017, after Etihad Airways withdrew funding after years of losses.Last week Air Berlin’s liquidator confirmed the carrier had repaid the loan. Though it has not found a buyer, the loan has reduced damages for passengers, employees and business partners.Meanwhile, Thomas Cook GmbH, the German subsidiary of Thomas Cook, also filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company said it was forced to take the step to free itself from financial entanglements and liabilities after its parent company filed for insolvency on Monday.Thomas Cook GmbH said it would restructure the business and run it independently. “Of course we would have liked to avoid this legal step,” said the chief executive, Stefanie Berk. “But sadly no short-term solution could be reached in our negotiations.”Its operations include the tour groups Thomas Cook GmbH, Thomas Cook Touristik GmbH and Bucher Reisen \u0026amp Öger Tours GmbH and others."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58cf333076c221f8038cbdafff98e7b826ba1d7c/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88811bb315220ef7eef8a7f7b37f77e6","title":"sainsburys close 70 argos stores reorganisation","story":"Shops to be replaced by outlets inside supermarkets as group aims to cut costs by £500mSainsbury’s is to close up to 70 Argos stores and replace them with outlets inside its supermarkets.The closures are part of a reorganisation of the retailer’s store portfolio that will also involve the closure of up to 15 supermarkets and 40 convenience stores. But 10 new supermarkets will also be opened and more than 100 new convenience stores are planned. Eighty new Argos outlets will be opened inside supermarkets.The reorganisation is likely to cost hundreds of jobs and was announced as the grocer revealed a further fall in sales. The supermarket group said it was aiming to reduce costs by £500m over five years and cut debts by £750m as a result of rejigging its store estate.It said it would also stop selling mortgages through its banking operation. Home loan sales would stop immediately, the company said, as it wanted to halt capital injections into Sainsbury’s Bank by next year. The company, which began offering mortgages in 2017, has pumped hundreds of millions of pounds into the bank since taking full ownership of it in 2014.Sainsbury’s exit from mortgages comes after Tesco and Which? pulled out of the market in May amid a price war in the mortgage sector, which has been hit by a slowdown in the housing market.It said pretax profits in the first half of its financial year would be £50m lower partly because of unseasonable weather and higher marketing costs.

That double blow came days after the Northern Irish businessman Darren Donnelly also withdrew from making a potential bid for the firm.The original Routemaster bus was mostly withdrawn from service in London to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The original 1956 design was not accessible for wheelchair users, and was difficult for people with limited mobility or with pushchairs.Boris Johnson, then the Conservative mayoral candidate for London, announces he is contemplating introducing a modern-day Routemaster.Now elected mayor, Johnson announces the New Bus for London competition to design it. The requirements are for a low-floor red double-decker bus with at least one internal staircase, a rear open platform, and one other entranceexit with doors.Six manufacturers are invited to compete to design and build the new bus, with Northern Ireland-based vehicle manufacturer Wrightbus awarded the contract in December.\u0026nbsp The final design is unveiled the following May.Johnson drives an early prototype of his bus in a public demonstration.The new bus goes into service for the first time, on the No 38 route between Clapton and Victoria.Johnson commits to ordering 600 of the buses at an anticipated cost of about £160m.Modifications to the design of the rear doors mean the buses will be operated with only a driver, and the “hop onhop off” rear platform will be closed while the bus is not at a stop. This breaks Johnson’s election promise that the buses would be operated by two crew members and removes the unique “hop onhop off” flexibility the original Routemaster had brought to London’s streets, the main reason for introducing the new design.Tfl spends an additional £2m fitting opening windows on the top deck of the buses, which Londoner nicknamed ‘Roastmasters’ for how hot they get inside. Temperatures had been recorded as high as 32.5C, higher than the legal limit for transporting live cattle.Sadiq Khan, Johnson’s successor as London mayor, declines to order further new routemaster buses.A TfL response to n freedom of information request reveals that the total capital cost of the vehicles is about £346m - approximately £430,000 per bus, nearly double the cost of purchasing conventional buses.It is announced that Wrightbus, the bus manufacturer Johnson contracted to build the buses, is goes into administration.The accounting group Deloitte, which had been running the sales auction for the company, has now been appointed administrator for a collection of the businesses within the group, including Wrights Group, Wrightbus, Wright En-Drive, Wright Composites and Metallix.The firm’s collapse came after Boris Johnson told parliament his government would do everything it could to help Wrightbus. Ian Paisley, the MP for North Antrim, also told the  last week he believed the government had already demonstrated it could help the stricken manufacturer without breaching state aid rules by directing state-controlled companies to place orders with Wrightbus.However, a government source strenuously denied any such assurances had been given. A source close to the company’s board also denied government support had been offered.Michael Magnay, who is joint administrator, said: “We recognise the companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years.“The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.”The firms have about 1,250 employees and just 50 will remain to assist with the winding down if no buyer can be found.Paisley said: “Administration, I hope, offers an opportunity to attract a sale on amended terms to the last month’s negotiations. I can’t imagine a situation where Ballymena would be without its bus building company and I hope we can get this matter resolved quickly.”Workers dragged heavy toolboxes out of the factory after hearing the news. Gordon Mairs, who has been with the firm for 22 years, said many workers were angry with management.“Boris Johnson as his hobby makes buses out of wooden crates. What he needs to do is stop with his hobby and engage now straight away in a rescue plan to save these jobs and save this area. What future is there for young people in Ballymena?”Unite added that it estimated a further 1,700 jobs were at risk in the supply chain. One Wrightbus supplier said: “There’s going to be a lot of debt out there. There’s a lot of local suppliers. For Ballymena and everything it’s not good.”Sir William Wright, Jeff Wright’s father and the head of the family owners of Wrightbus, advocated Britain leaving the EU during the 2016 referendum. He also nominated Paisley as the Democratic Unionist party’s Westminster candidate. The DUP is a staunch backer of Brexit.The parent company of Wrights Group also donated more than £16.1m to charity between 2012 and 2017. Those donations helped to fund the expansion of Green Pastures, an influential evangelical church in Ballymena run by Jeff Wright .Workers said they planned to protest at the church on Sunday. Lee Kyle, who has 17 years’ experience of coach building at Wrightbus, said: “I think it’s disgusting. There’s 1,200 people put out of work because of the church. The men are destroyed. This is all they know since school. Where do they go?”Following the donations, Wrightbus has increasingly been struggling with its finances and made two rounds of redundancies last year, with 95 jobs going in  February and June. It had recent sales successes, including a Transport for London order in May for 20 hydrogen-powered buses, which each cost about £500,000 and only emit water as exhaust.However, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, cancelled further purchases of the New Routemasters in 2016, which had been launched with a huge fanfare when Johnson was running the capital in 2012.The UK bus market has since slowed. Operators have taken a cautious approach to new orders after ordering a large number of vehicles in recent years to meet stricter emissions standards.In its last set of accounts, for the 12 months to December 2017, Wrights Group made sales of £227m and a profit of £1.5m – down from £264m and £10.7m on the year before. The financial position of the company is thought to have deteriorated significantly since the last financial update.Before the potential bidders pulled out of talks last week, the company had raised staff hopes that a deal was imminent. On Thursday, Wrightbus management told employees it was “now in a race to complete a final deal with credible bidders”.It added: “This ongoing business and its employees are our number one priority and we are confident that a positive outcome can be delivered over the next few days.”Wrights Group did not comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a15a22e148defc5a980551f92098c299f9dee89/0_198_5074_3045/master/5074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c328b33af7c1739f17da108335f642","title":"try before you buy german city offers workers a free one month stay","story":"Picturesque Görlitz is offering free lodging and studio space in exchange for feedback on what potential residents want from a cityLast year Eva Bodenmüller read about a city in eastern Germany inviting people to live there for a month for free. She and her partner Carsten Borck, an artist, knew they had to leave their residence in Italy soon and weren’t looking forward to moving back to their native Berlin.“I thought: ‘Why not Görlitz?’” said Bodenmüller, a freelance journalist .Görlitz, Germany’s easternmost city, is a well-preserved gem that has played the part of quaint Mitteleuropean burg in Hollywood films from The Grand Budapest Hotel to Inglourious Basterds to The Reader. But its pastel-coloured old town, which draws 140,000 tourists a year, hides a darker reality.City officials decided they needed to do something to reverse this trend, and hit upon the idea of offering a free one-month stay, no strings attached.Other cities had already been experimenting with the idea of luring new residents by offering to cover their housing. Detroit was the first big city to try it, launching an innovative programme of paying promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year, and today the idea is being used everywhere from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela, Italy, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, which offers $10,000 to digital workers to move there for a year.The proportion of workers who conduct their business remotely is growing. Already, millions of people spend much of their adult lives hopscotching from one place to another, perhaps including the occasional work-tourism visit to Medellín or Tokyo. The officials behind Görlitz’s programme figured it could both attract some of those nomadic workers and give them the chance to learn some lessons on how to reverse its population decline.“When we applied we thought the project was about convincing people to move to Görlitz,” Borck said over borscht at a restaurant overlooking the Neisse River. “But now we have the feeling it doesn’t matter whether we stay here after these four weeks or not. We’re just the laboratory mice for this science experiment.”The Görlitz-based Interdisciplinary Centre for Ecological and Revitalising Urban Transformation (IZS), which is overseeing Testing the City, as the federally funded project is known, received more than 150 applications. Two-thirds were from larger cities, and several came from outside Germany, including from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the US and the UK.The 54 iniduals and groups participating are singles, couples and families ranging from their 20s to 60s, including digital entrepreneurs, a film-maker, a model, visual artists and musicians. Each is assigned to one of three project-maintained apartments and offered free use of one of three spaces for work.Though the municipality hopes that some will permanently relocate to Görlitz, the main intention is for ISZ to use participant interviews and questionnaires to inform a national urban development policy to help revive Germany’s smaller cities. “Our aim is to learn more about what people need, and if they move, what is their motivation,” said IZS head Robert Knippschild.Görlitz is a fascinating place to test these theories. The city has around 7,000 vacant apartments, and unemployment is a third higher than the national average. This, in part, is why Görlitz has taken in 1,200 refugees. But surveys have shown immigration to be the most urgent issue for residents of eastern Germany, where the far right has taken hold.“It was a tough campaign,” said Ursu, a Romanian immigrant who played lead trumpet in the local philharmonic orchestra before turning to politics. He says he wants to put the animosity of the election in the past, and sees Testing the City as part of a budding revival which includes a new data analysis centre employing 120 scientists and engineers, a Siemens hydrogen technologies innovation campus that will employ another 100, and a €36m (£32m) facelift for the art nouveau municipal hall.Ursu believes the key to creating jobs is a more welcoming society. “I’ve said to the people, you must think about whether you want to have an open city, a European city, or a closed city,” he said.This is not a settled question in Görlitz. A July report on the project by the German news outlet Deutsche Welle attracted sharp comments online. “The incentive to lure you here is just the desperate attempt of our city to fight the shrinking population,” said YouTube user Polter Geist. “They hope your leftwing alternative garbage will appeal to the youth.”During their stay, Bodenmüller and Borck have sought to engage with these issues directly. Borck staged a show of his work at the Europa Haus gallery, with posters asking passersby questions such as “Am I welcome here?” and “How do I know you are not a Nazi?”.The couple said they spent a lot of time talking to locals and found a city of extremes. “In other places you generally have people from different groups talking to each other,” said Bodenmüller, who has lived in Berlin, Munich and several smaller towns. “But here there is no centre – there are just the two sides.”Another project participant, Nikolas Kammerer, 34, a photographer from Leipzig, sees the locals as one of the city’s main draws. He found it refreshing that artists and creative workers in Görlitz are not looking to become YouTube stars or Instagram influencers, but instead are laser-focused on producing and collaborating. He credits his month in the city for his first successful commission for the German news outlet Die Zeit: a portrait series of local voters on election day. “In Leipzig I probably wouldn’t have done this,” he said.He also saw the other perspective, at a far-right election rally where the AfD candidate denounced foreigners as criminals and the crowd chanted “Lugen Presse!” (“lying press!”). “It was horrible,” said Kammerer, whose grandmother is from Görlitz. “Most of these far-right people don’t want to talk to the media, which is a problem because I want to have them represented in my work.”With the project about halfway through, four participants have committed to move to Görlitz, including German-Finnish poet Mark Mallon and his wife, Finnish artist Venla Saalo. The couple decided to leave Berlin because of its traffic, pollution and high rents, and settled in Görlitz in April. “Görlitz feels like a lively town with a lot of young people, students, opportunities, empty spaces, and on the other hand peace and remoteness,” they said. “It is a great combination for creative work.”Borck and Bodenmüller like the cheap rents and high density of organic grocery stores and vegetarian restaurants but wish Görlitz had better regional transport and more open-mindedness. They also wished they had more time there.“It’s very intense, to try to meet people, learn the city and do our work in just four weeks,” said Bodenmüller. “If we could stay here longer, we could leave and come back and have a better chance to understand the city.”Knippschild’s early conclusions from the pilot project suggest that cultural offerings and leisure activities are crucial to attracting nomadic workers, as are reliable travel connections and good housing.“People are taking the project seriously, thinking about which phase of life they are in and what they need in terms of housing and living,” he said of the participants. “This is giving us a great deal of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Görlitz.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70131044a906eaf9750e7c9a6101944a810b2ae0/0_2196_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11ab2a57c3366cce530673d8766fcb18","title":"what lies beneath the craze for selfeets of eye catching floors","story":"Cities on Instagram: Hundreds of thousands of people have shared striking floor designs – sometimes from unusual placesFrom brightly patterned tiles to intricate mosaics, sometimes beauty is right under our feet.Hundreds of thousands of Instagrammers have shared photos of eye-catching floors using the #ihavethisthingwithfloors hashtag.

As a barrister, I have seen how the government’s hostile immigration environment extends to refusing asylum claims on the basis of FGM, leaving girls and women liable to deportation to countries where this practice is prevalent, if not the norm. The government claims it is committed to supporting victims of FGM and prosecuting perpetrators. Yet when girls at risk of being cut claim asylum, they are turned away.FGM is a gross abuse of human rights and is a recognised ground for asylum. But the Home Office often claims that, contrary to the evidence, the risk of FGM in such cases is low. They say the mother can single-handedly protect her daughter from familial or community pressure to undergo FGM or that, just because the mother has been cut, it does not follow that her daughter will be cut or the state can protect the girl from FGM even though laws to allow this have never been enforced.Research into women’s asylum claims in Europe shows that decision-makers apply too high a standard of proof, requiring independent evidence of a kind virtually impossible to obtain, and are insensitive to the impact of shame and trauma caused by FGM on the willingness of women to be frank in their evidence.In the family ision of the high court, Karon Monaghan QC and I represented Jasmine’s mother, who was desperately trying to protect her daughter from facing the same abusive fate she had suffered as a child. The mother underwent type III FGM, the most physically severe. One of the single biggest indicators that a girl is at risk is her mother having been cut. The mother, who is of Sudanese origin with Bahraini citizenship, says her two sisters died as a result of the brutal practice.The family arrived in the UK in 2012, when Jasmine was three years old. The home secretary refused the asylum claim in 2015 and the immigration courts turned down her appeal applications. The family had reached the end of the road. Though both social services and the National FGM Centre agree that Jasmine is at high risk of FGM if deported, in September 2018 the Home Office told the family they would be put on a flight and removed to Bahrain.In 2015, I and a group of human rights lawyers successfully lobbied the Conservative-led coalition to introduce FGM protection orders – designed, for example, to allow a court to order a girl’s passport to be held to prevent her from leaving the country. In Jasmine’s case, social services applied for a protection order to stop the home secretary from removing her, which the court granted. But the home secretary challenged the family court’s power to make an order stopping deportation.Today, the president of the family court accepted the home secretary’s position – that it has no power to stop the government from deporting Jasmine even if it believes there is a high risk of FGM. The court is entrusted with making life-changing decisions about a child’s welfare, yet today it decided to limit its own power to keep girls safe from FGM. This government is more concerned with its vote-oriented commitment to reduce immigration rather than to enforceits obligation to enforce the UK’s international law to promote and protect the welfare of vulnerable girls like Jasmine. In doing so, it exposes a glaring double standard. On the one hand it postures about its commitment to prosecute minority ethnic parents in the UK over FGM, yet on the other hand it deports women and girls at risk of mutilation abroad.If the government was genuinely committed to protecting women and girls from FGM, it would be concerned with them being cut overseas. All the international evidence shows, and the law fundamentally recognises, that FGM is a transnational crime. Jasmine’s case is continuing. Her mother has not given up hope. We will try to persuade the home secretary to accept expert assessments and grant her secure immigration status. The alternative may destroy this 10-year-old’s life.• Charlotte Proudman is a human rights barrister specialising in violence against women and girls"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4deea5931c69237aeaa9cd56dc79d9764d965c9c/0_334_5508_3305/master/5508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56f6387643b8ec48c9020c26b59c4d9c","title":"labour green new deal","story":"Labour’s embrace of the Green New Deal is truly momentous, even if it was overshadowed by the supreme court rulingThe most significant political moment of the last decade happened on Tuesday afternoon, not in the supreme court, but on a packed floor of the Brighton Centre during Labour party conference. Delegates overwhelmingly voted in favour of two motions backing a Green New Deal, a programme that will decarbonise the UK through a “radical policy package to increase social and economic justice”. One of the motions included a target for the UK to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030, and one did not – instead, calling for the UK to act as a world leader on climate change, and to establish a National Climate Service.The 2030 net-zero emissions target now has a very real chance of being included in the Labour party manifesto. Jim Pickard, chief political correspondent for the Financial Times, said the target was “one of the most radical policies by a mainstream political party in my lifetime”.The motions had a tricky journey to the conference floor. On one hand, the GMB union, which represents thousands of workers in the fossil-fuel industry, felt it could not support a 2030 target without a credible transition plan for its members. On the other, Labour for a Green New Deal, a grassroots organisation run on a voluntary basis by young Labour members, felt that the target was non-negotiable, because of the urgency of the situation.And so two separate motions were debated, both were won, and in the end, neither contradicted the other. Instead, the GMB motion could be seen as a challenge to the Labour party and its grassroots activists to come up with a concrete plan to meet the 2030 target. The fact that both motions passed gives the party wriggle room to respond.The response to the 2030 target has ranged from jubilant to muted to panicked. Unsurprisingly, the latter type of reaction came from the CBI, which argued that there is “no credible pathway” to a 2030 target. This is the kind of thinking we can expect to see from an organisation that wants climate catastrophe to be averted without major changes to business as usual. But the whole point of a Green New Deal is to respond to the fact that business as usual risks leading human civilisation to collapse.The reality is the science demands a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2030. If that isn’t possible within the current system, then it’s the system that needs to go, not the target. Perhaps the CBI should ask itself what the future for businesses looks like in a world where extreme weather collapses buildings, where British people are transformed into climate refugees as sea levels rise, and where politics is even more fractious and unstable as our representatives struggle to respond to the consequences. If the CBI has factored all of these features of global heating into its assessments, and has concluded that it doesn’t care, I leave it to the reader to judge the legitimacy of its intervention in the debate.The motions put paid to the idea that unions and climate activists need to be in opposition over the climate crisis. To its enormous credit, Labour for a Green New Deal secured the support of nearly all major unions. In fact, Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary of Unite the Union, took to the conference floor to enthusiastically back both motions, and call for climate reparations for the global south. His position, warmly received by assembled delegates, was more upbeat and radical than that of some environmental NGOs.GMB delegate Joseph Ghayouba spoke passionately about the miners’ strike, a scarring collective memory for the union movement, and a reminder of what happens when governments bring industries to a close without a plan for those working within them. This should be taken as an incentive for activists and unions to work together to flesh out the specifics of policy to ensure that workers, and the unions that represent them, are protected. But the thing that unites organised labour and young activists is a fundamental understanding that the system is broken. A Green New Deal is the opportunity for them to create something new.By the end of this century, society as we understand it will be unrecognisable. Either we will live in a decaying, overheated, brown wasteland like the one the current government is taking us into, or in a world with shorter working hours, cheap public transport, verdant forests and good jobs.

I must follow them, for I am their leader.” For months following the release of the Mueller report, Pelosi had resisted pressure from within her caucus to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. But now, with more than two-thirds of Democrats in the House of Representatives favoring impeachment in the wake of Trump’s Ukrainian scandal, she has reversed herself and announced a formal impeachment inquiry.Pelosi had objected to impeachment mainly for political reasons. She observed that the Mueller Report’s lengthy catalogue of Trump’s malefactions didn’t move public sentiment toward impeachment. She predicted that the Republican-dominated Senate would surely reject any articles of impeachment approved by the Democratic House, making the process appear to be merely partisan theater — a repeat of the 1998 impeachment proceedings mounted against President Bill Clinton by House Republicans, which ultimately backfired and led to Democratic gains in that year’s elections. And she pointed out that impeachment proceedings might jeopardize the moderate Democrats who won Republican-held districts in 2018, allowing the party to regain control of the House.But on September 23, a group of seven first-term Democrats from those very battleground districts — all of whom had served in the military or defense and intelligence agencies, and six of whom had previously opposed impeachment — wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post declaring that “If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.” Perhaps Pelosi, like those seven representatives, changed her mind because of the gravity of the new allegations, but their reversal certainly undercut her pragmatic political case against impeachment. And the Trump administration’s stonewalling of congressional investigations and refusal to abide by long-established norms of political conduct weakened Pelosi’s argument that methods short of impeachment could determine the truth of the allegations.As a country, we now enter what the seven freshmen called “unchartered waters,” with an unprecedented political and constitutional crisis looming on the horizon. Impeachment proceedings could turn public opinion decisively against Trump, as with President Richard Nixon and Watergate, perhaps leading to Trump’s premature departure from the White House. It’s also possible that impeachment could backfire on the Democrats, costing them control of the House and enabling Trump’s reelection in 2020.If the latter scenario comes to pass, it may appear in hindsight that Pelosi’s caucus stampeded her into action against her better judgment. She had previously insisted that impeachment would require public support as well as backing from at least some Republicans. It’s too soon for polls to determine whether the latest revelations have shifted public opinion significantly, but so far only one Republican — Representative Justin Amash of Michigan — has called for Trump’s impeachment, and he quit the party soon afterwards.Chances are, however, that Pelosi is calculating that while impeachment will pour petrol on America’s already incendiary politics, Democrats stand to benefit from the conflagration. That’s largely because, unlike the Mueller report, the Ukrainian scandal involves what appear to be clear and comprehensible issues of corruption and threats to U.S. national security and the electoral process. Trump already has admitted that he attempted to pressure a foreign government to dig up dirt to use against his political opponent, Joe Biden, and he may also have withheld military aid appropriated by Congress as further leverage. We don’t yet know exactly what is in the whistleblower’s complaint, and perhaps there will be no definitive evidence of an aid-for-dirt quid pro quo. But Trump’s actions will be difficult for Republicans running in 2020 to defend or distance themselves from.The scandal likely will prove especially damaging in the suburban swing districts where Democrats won their House majority in 2018. Historically, the college-educated voters who predominate in such districts voted Republican because they considered it the party of stability and responsibility. There are many reasons why college-educated voters (particularly women) have been tilting against the Republicans in recent elections. But the Ukrainian scandal, however it plays out, will strengthen the sense among these voters that Trump considers himself to be above the law and constitutional restraints, and further erode the Republican party’s reputation as the law-and-order party. Undoubtedly this is why the statement issued by Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer emphasized that the decision to launch impeachment proceedings was “not a partisan matter, it’s about the integrity of our democracy, respect for the rule of law and defending our Constitution.”Looking ahead to the 2020 election, the Ukrainian scandal is likely to put many Republicans running in those battleground districts in an untenable position. If they agree that the president’s actions merit condemnation, they will alienate the ferociously pro-Trump Republican base, but if they run as Trump defenders they will lose the moderate majorities in those districts.The Democrats’ decision to begin impeachment proceedings has set the country on a course whose end is impossible to predict, but right now the political advantage seems to rest with Nancy Pelosi. In the wake of the Mueller report, she successfully prevented a drive toward impeachment that could have split the Democrats’ moderates and progressives. Although Ukraine-gate and the moderates’ resulting bolt toward impeachment may have forced her hand, she now presides over a unified caucus prepared to launch an investigation that may prove extremely dangerous for Trump and the Republicans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/623fe3a68d0bdf56c905d518acc1bf0dffaf28d7/0_0_5651_3391/master/5651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb0e17c0390a4dda332efb5d90333bdc","title":"dont let go review david oyelowo","story":"In this very silly drama, David Oyelowo plays a cop investigating a horrific crime with the help of a phone call from the pastThe immense silliness of this high-concept, time-shift cop thriller about a detective solving a murder case with help from the victim phoning from two weeks before her death makes it virtually impossible to take seriously. Even with an intelligent, credible performance by David Oyelowo, the daftness and utter implausibility of a smartphone so smart it can make calls to the future is overwhelming.The opening 15 minutes are entertaining enough: this is the bit before the time-travel tricksiness. Don’t Let Go is set in LA, where detective Jack Radcliff (Oyelowo), a good cop and solid dependable guy, keeps an eye on his teenage niece Ashley (beautifully played by Storm Reid) whose dad is struggling with addiction. One day, Jack gets a panicky call from Ashley, and, rushing over to her house, walks into a crime scene in which everyone is dead. Days later, paralysed by grief, he gets a call from Ashley. She sounds cheery and very much undead.Jack deduces that she is speaking to him from another time period – two weeks before her murder. Director and co-writer Jacob Estes explains nothing. Has there been some freaky fold in the fabric of time? Is the psychic bond between uncle and niece so strong that not even death can break it?There are some nice Groundhog Day moments as Jack recruits Ashley to help investigate the murders that, in her timeframe, have yet to happen. He begins to alter events in the past, leading to a clammy sense of chaos and time unravelling. But in this end, this contrived concept doesn’t remotely come off. It’s so barmy you half expect Jack to wake up and realise it’s all been a dream, or to be carted off for psychiatric care.

A soft, yielding, delicious, not too onerous recipe that soothes and comforts always. It is always quite amusing whenever another filling is suggested, that everyone’s eyes turn down and they murmur: “But can’t it be chicken?” Invariably, it is chicken.Serves 6-8unsalted butter 125g celery 1 head, finely choppedcarrots 3, finely choppedleeks 2, finely choppedonions 3 small, finely choppedgarlic 2 cloves, finely choppedstreaky bacon 3 rashers, thinly slicedolive oil 6-8 tbsp chicken legs 6 white wine 1 bottle chicken stock 500ml thyme, marjoram and summer savory (if savory and marjoram prove elusive, simply up the thyme) 3 sprigs of each, tied in a posy with twine or bacon rindbay leaves 5 sea salt and freshly ground pepper to tasteflat-leaf parsley 2 tbsp, chopped lemon finely grated zest of ½rough or puff pastry 500gegg 1 milk a spoonfulHeat a wide, heavy bottomed pot, add in the butter and melt. Add in the chopped vegetables and bacon. Stir this well and place a lid on top, lifting to stir from time to time, and let the vegetables cook, steaming until soft and bright.Meanwhile, heat a wide frying pan, add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the chicken legs until gently golden, then add them to the vegetables.Pour in the wine and stock, add the herb posy and bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, and place the lid atop and let cook for 45 minutes over the gentlest heat. When the meat is just cooked, turn off the heat and leave to cool, then lift the chicken out and carefully pick the meat from the bones and add back into the pot.Stir the pot of vegetables and chicken and taste for seasoning. Remove the bundle of herbs and the bay leaves. Add the chopped parsley and the finely grated zest of lemon. Mix all this together very well but not so much as to break the meat into smaller pieces.Heat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4 and fill a handsome pie dish with the chicken and vegetables. Roll out the pastry to cover the dish, about 3-5mm thick. Top the dish with the pastry sheet. Crack the egg into a cup and beat with a fork and then add the milk, then brush liberally over the pastry. Use any offcuts to make a decoration, if you’re feeling creative.Bake the pie for 45 minutes until the top is golden brown and piping hot. A mighty bowl of parsley and mustard mash alongside, and a bowl of peas, are a fine accompaniment. Jeremy Lee is the chef-proprietor of Quo Vadis, London W1Pheasant is generally speaking, excellent value for money. The lean birds can be a little dry so I like to casserole-roast them, finding the result juicier, and with the addition of a few robust flavours, the bird is almost self-saucing.When buying a pheasant, choose the plumpest-looking bird. The addition of cinnamon may seem a little odd, but it adds a delicious scent to the cooking juices. The savoy cabbage puree can be made ahead of time and gently reheated later.Serves 2 savoy cabbage puree serves 4-6rind-less fat streaky bacon 100g olive oil 1 tbsp plump pheasant 1 red wine 150ml, eg cabernet sauvignontinned or bottled tomatoes 100g, finely choppedcinnamon stick ½ rosemary 1 sprig, about 6cm longsea salt and freshly ground black pepperbutter 25g (optional)For the savoy cabbage pureesavoy cabbage 1 head water 1.75 litres sea salt and freshly ground black pepperregular or double cream 25-40ml salted butter 25-40gPreheat the oven at 180Cgas mark 4. Cut the bacon into fine lardons, about 3cm long and 5mm thick. Heat a heavy casserole on a gentle heat until quite hot. Add the olive oil and then the bacon, stirring it regularly with a wooden spoon and allowing it to become slightly crisp and golden. Remove from the casserole and leave to drain on kitchen paper.Dry the breast of the pheasant and place it, breast side down, in the fat remaining in the casserole. Cook gently until the breast is golden. Do not try to rush this stage of the recipe, otherwise you may burn the casserole, in which case the flavour of the sauce at the end will be spoiled. Remove the pheasant from the pan and pour off the excess fat. Replace the casserole on a low heat and add the wine, tomatoes, cinnamon, rosemary and bacon. Place the pheasant on top and season with salt and pepper. Place a piece of greaseproof paper and a tight-fitting lid on the casserole and cook in the oven for 1 hour.For the savoy cabbage puree, remove any damaged outside leaves from the cabbage. However, don’t remove any more of those nice green outside leaves than is necessary, as they are full of flavour and will give lovely bright green flecks to the finished puree. Place the cabbage on a chopping board and cut directly down through the middle of the head, then quarter and remove the hard core. Slice the cabbage against the grain, nice and thinly.Bring the water to the boil and salt well. Add the cabbage and cook uncovered at a simmer until it is just tender. Strain the cabbage well, reserving 100ml of the cooking water. In a blender or using a handheld blender, blend to a coarse puree, adding cream and butter as you see fit. The consistency should be like that of a soft mashed potato. If the puree is a bit firm, add a little of the reserved cooking water to soften it and blend briefly again. Taste and correct the seasoning and serve in a hot dish. A non-stick pan is perfect for reheating it, and a little of the reserved cooking water can be used if the puree has thickened in the meantime.When the bird is cooked, remove the casserole from the oven and reduce the temperature to 100Cgas mark ¼. Put the pheasant on a dish, cover it with greaseproof paper, and put it back into the oven to keep warm. Place the casserole on a gentle heat and bring the juices to a simmer. Taste and decide if the liquid needs to reduce a little to concentrate the flavour. If it already tastes delicious, you are ready to go. I sometimes swirl a little butter into the juices at this stage, just to give the sauce a little more body – however, the sauce should not become too thick and strong.Carve the pheasant neatly and serve with the bubbling sauce and the savoy cabbage puree.From Master It: How to Cook Today by Rory O’Connell (Fourth Estate, £16.99)This is one of the lightest cakes you’ll make with wholemeal flour, but it depends on both beating the eggs to a thick froth and adding a little baking powder. The cake freezes well unfilled so you could bake in advance and wait till the berries look just right.Serves 6-8eggs 4 medium, at room temperaturecaster sugar 200g golden syrup 50g wholemeal flour 150g baking powder ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tsp cold milk 100ml double cream a small tub blackberries 1 punnet, or blackberry jamicing sugar for dustingLine the base and sides of a deep 20cm round cake tin with non-stick baking paper, and heat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Beat the eggs with the sugar and syrup using the whisk attachment on an electric mixer, until pale and thick and the mixture falls like thick ribbons when the beaters are lifted from the bowl. Sift the wholemeal flour, baking powder and cinnamon once, adding back any bran that the sieve collects. Add the milk to the beaten eggs and whisk, then add the flour and whisk once more until just smooth. Pour the mixture into the cake tin and bake in the centre of the oven for 35 minutes, covering the top of the cake with foil for the last 10 minutes if you need to stop it from burning. When a skewer inserted comes out with just a few tiny moist crumbs stuck to it, remove from the oven and leave to cool. Whip the cream lightly, halve the blackberries, then slice the cake into 2 layers and fill with cream and fruit, reassemble the cake and dust lightly with icing sugar or top with extra whipped cream and blackberries.From Short and Sweet by Dan Lepard (Fourth Estate, £25)This is what coronation chicken would taste like if you replaced the chicken with cauliflower and hard-boiled egg.

Once combined, spread out on a large parchment-lined baking tray and roast for 15 minutes, until soft and golden-brown but still retaining a bite. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.Fill a medium pan with plenty of water and bring to the boil on a high heat.

I used chanterelles, but almost any fresh mushrooms will do (in fact, it will be lovely made with just dried porcini alone). If you don’t have stock, soak the porcini in the same amount of hot water instead. You can use dry sherry or vermouth rather than wine. And for a vegan version, replace the butter with olive oil and the cheese with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.Boil 150ml water and use this to soak the dried mushrooms for at least five minutes. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion or shallots, grate the parmesan and trim and gently brush any dirt off the fresh mushrooms with a damp cloth. If you have large mushrooms, cut them into bite-sized pieces.Bring the stock to a simmer, strain in the mushroom soaking water, and set aside the soaked mushrooms. Taste the stock: you’ll be reducing it further, so it shouldn’t be too salty to begin with – dilute with a little more water, if necessary, then leave on a low heat while you get on with the risotto.Melt the butter in a wide saucepan over a medium-low heat, and gently fry the chopped onion until soft – don’t let it colour. Tip in the rice and cook, stirring, until most of the grains are coated and translucent – this will take a few minutes.Turn up the heat under the pan slightly and, once it’s warmed back up, pour in the wine it should sizzle as it hits the pan. Cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, then start adding the stock one ladleful at a time, continuing to stir as you do so, and not adding the next ladle of stock until the pan is almost dry.After about 10 minutes, stir in the soaked dried mushrooms. Keep adding stock and stirring until the rice is done to your liking – this should take another eight to 12 minutes, though exactly how long will depend on your tastes. In theory, the rice should still be firm, but not chalky in the middle if you prefer it softer, however, that’s your prerogative.Once you’re happy with the texture of the rice, correct the consistency of the mixture risotto shouldn’t sit on the plate like a solid lump, but flow across it like a wave, so add a little more stock, if need be, stirring until the rice is loose and creamy. Stir in most of the grated parmesan and a tablespoon of the extra butter, then cover the pan and leave to sit off the heat for five minutes.While the risotto is resting, finely chop or crush the garlic and melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the garlic for 30 seconds or so, before turning up the heat and adding the fresh mushrooms. Saute for a few minutes until they’re just starting to brown around the edges, then take off the heat.Give the risotto a good stir and season to taste (it probably won’t need any more salt, because the parmesan has a fair bit already). Divide between plates or shallow bowls and top with the fried mushroom mixture.

This year’s advice from the ICES revealed estimates of only 81,224 tonnes, below the “safe biological level” for the population and putting it at increased danger of collapse.Chris Thorne, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “The MSC withdrawing North Sea cod’s sustainability certificate reflects what we already knew: our cod, like our oceans, are in crisis. Industrial over-fishing has driven stocks of cod in the North Sea to the point of collapse again, but despite this governments continue to ignore the science and allow overfishing to continue.”Aoife Martin, the director of operations at Seafish, the organiser of the annual national fish and chip awards, said: “North Sea cod is still a sustainably managed fishery and fishermen can still catch it within the agreed limits, there will just be less of it available to buy. The decision to reduce the allowed catch is a great example of responsible fisheries management.”Try to buy fish with MSC labels.

The governing body has written to City requesting their observations.Guardiola said: “I don’t know what is going to happen but they should put the focus on other issues because they don’t know which guy you are talking about. Bernardo is one of the most lovely people I have ever met in my life.“He speaks four or five languages – that is the best way to understand how open-minded he is – and one of his best friends is Mendy. He is like a brother for him. The image for the two is not about the colour of the skin.

While Fifa 20 is mostly very good, the issue of card-purchased loot boxes in its most popular mode, Ultimate Team, has led to calls for the game to be classified as gambling.A recap, for those unaware of the brouhaha: in Ultimate Team, you build a fantasy squad by opening loot box-style packs of inidual player cards. You can use in-game currency to buy these packs, or do so using real money – but the chances of finding Messi, Ronaldo or Salah are … well, we don’t know, because EA doesn’t disclose unambiguous odds. There’s your first problem.The second is that this is a family-rated game, with teenagers around the globe spending money they don’t necessarily have chasing cards they’ll likely never get. In Belgium cash sales ceased in January, but elsewhere it’s business as usual. Some plan to boycott until EA makes pack odds clearer or implements an age rating, as neither is present here.The issue isn’t all weighted one way. For those disciplined enough to avoid micro-transactions, Ultimate Team remains the best mode in all of sports gaming. Squad building challenges – in which you complete puzzles to earn superior cards – rely on skill rather than luck, and savvy use of the transfer market earns top players without spending a penny. A new XP system, where everything you do builds towards rewards such as Wilfried Zaha or Lucas Vázquez, also eliminates fortune from the equation.Plus, for anyone weaned on Panini collections, opening packs is the most euphoric part: to remove any chance of randomly unearthing last season’s top scorer or your club’s cult hero would be to disarm the mode’s magic. Change seems inescapable, but an age gate feels like a more balanced compromise. Finishing your album never felt quite so fun when ordering specific stickers direct from the manufacturer.Judge Fifa for its on-field abilities and you discover a football sim keen to deliver big, memorable moments: crazy, mazy dribbles and thunderbolts arrowed into the top corner. Defending is difficult, and 0-0 draws as rare as a VAR-free Match Of The Day episode. There’s no attempt to match PES 2020’s cerebral passing game: Fifa 20 is all-action all the time. It won’t suit purists, but the just-one-more-game pull at 11pm when you have workcollegeschool the next day is gravity-strong.This is particularly true of Volta mode. Inspired by fan requests to exhume the Fifa Street series, it enables teams of six or fewer players to do battle in small arenas based on real locations. And it’s superb. Claustrophobic pitches prevent pace being overpowered, and passing and shooting are reassuringly snappy – while skill moves are equal parts outrageous and hilarious. You’ll chuckle at some of the celebrations, too. When was the last time a Fifa game successfully delivered humour?Volta is best enjoyed using real-world teams, but its bespoke story mode also hosts light-hearted build-a-player amusement, albeit without the subtle performances that made Alex Hunter’s The Journey tale so likeable across Fifas 17 to 19. That, sadly, is gone – though some of its best elements now inform career mode.For much of Fifa’s history, career mode was the series’ focus, yet this decade it’s taken on the mantle of sacrificial lamb to Ultimate Team’s more immediate dream-team thrills. As such any kind of upgrade is welcome, and being able to converse interactively with squad members and the press – as occurred in The Journey – does break up the match-match-match grind. Variable potential ratings for young players add longevity, too.Whatever your mode of choice, the usual array of authentic teams and kits are included, with a noteworthy exception: Juventus are now exclusive to rival, Pro Evo, and rebranded Piemonte Calcio. Although player faces aren’t affected, it’s certainly curious to see Cristiano Ronaldo charging round in Sunday league garb. Still, one missing licence shouldn’t go down as a game-breaker. The new additions to Fifa 20 elevate it above “standard annual update” fare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8d6027b1a3ee1335c8febac8751c4722a5ec40/0_45_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=209c6913855b5d592b99b6f7d55f2989","title":"tell us about the moment you realised your cat loved you","story":"If you have lived with a cat we’d like to hear your stories about when you discovered they returned your affectionCats, it turns out, love humans more than we might think.

It sounds simple, but when you want to impress, the temptation to overcomplicate food can leave you feeling overwhelmed and overworked. So how do you make food to remember, without breaking your back in the kitchen? The answer is to take inspiration from the French – not their haute cuisine, but their countryside cooking, which is just as tasty and a fraction of the effort. The secret is simply to use the best quality ingredients, which should be left to do the culinary talking for you. When the basics are really good, there’s not much more you need to do other than throwing them together.Chicken is a great example. If you buy a standard supermarket chicken, you have to cover it in herbs and spices or even marinate it overnight to get a decent flavour out of it. Get yourself a poulet de bresse, and it’s a whole different story. These birds have been bred in the same French province for centuries, they have loads of space to run around, and they’re encouraged to eat a varied diet. Because of all that, you can put it straight in the oven on a low heat for an hour, then take it out, cover it in salt, and put it back in on high for 15 minutes, and you’ve got a meal for four that tastes out of this world.If you’ve got really nice bull’s heart tomatoes, cucumber and some olive oil, it’s pretty easy to just mix it up into a great salad to go with it crap vegetables make crap salads, and then you need to make it more complicated to make it taste better, which is a false economy. French culinary sensibilities make solo dining low effort too. I remember sitting out one night in Portugal with a tin of Ortiz tuna and crusty bread, and I just spent the whole evening on my balcony eating that with some drinks. It was perfect – no mayonnaise necessary.Speaking of drinks, when it comes to cocktails the same rules apply. If you’ve got good quality Grey Goose Vodka, you don’t need to mask the taste with syrupy mixers. Rather, you should let the inherent quality of Grey Goose Vodka do the talking, using it as the perfect base for botanical and classic citrus flavours such as elderflower, lemon juice or lime juice, as they complement the vodka without overpowering it – both Le Grand Fizz and Paris to Pampelonne are cocktails that add something new to the vodka without distracting from its taste. Grey Goose cocktails are wonderfully versatile too. If you’re pairing with something sweet, an Espresso Martini with high-quality espresso will balance things out nicely.Going straight to suppliers gives your food a story as well, which makes for great dinner party conversation. Customers love it when we wax lyrical about where our produce comes from in my restaurants, and so will your dinner party guests. Around six years ago, I was Instagramming some fishermen in their boat, and they were telling me what fish they’d caught that morning, and the next day it was in my restaurant. People love to hear these sorts of anecdotes because they help them feel connected to the food, which is why “I got it from the supermarket” never quite cuts it when you’re entertaining at home. While you will probably have picked your vodka from the supermarket, with a brand like Grey Goose there’s still a story to tell. Grey Goose is made with only two ingredients: single-origin Picardie winter wheat and water from its natural limestone well – a true reflection of Grey Goose’s French sensibilities.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd32eb2b3b16569e035616d0ea89a510963c9809/0_284_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a19e00ba1d62bf60344cdeab06b57f","title":"send us your questions for john humphrys","story":"The Today presenter has asked his final question.

The group’s chairman, Simon Bax, a former top executive at Pixar who sits on the board of Channel 4, will take the role of executive chairman.The company, which was co-founded in 1845 by mustard magnates the Colman family, has also decided to close its printing operation at Thorpe, outside of Norwich, which employs about 96 staff.The closure of the site, which prints Archant’s four daily newspapers and virtually all of its 50 weekly ones, brings an end to the company printing titles locally. It is understood the printing of its newspapers is to be outsourced to News UK, the publisher of the Sun and the Times.The combination of cost savings and commercial revenue from the seven-year deal makes the outsourcing move worth millions annually to Archant. The majority of Archant’s printing staff will transfer to News UK, which will print the titles at its operation at Broxbourne, however this is located more than 100 miles away from Norwich.Since joining in 2014, Henry, a former senior ITV executive, has battled to replace the inexorable decline in sales and ad revenue from print with income from digital sources as well as events and exhibitions.The strain local newspaper proprietors are facing can be seen in the sales decline of Archant’s flagship title, the 149-year old Eastern Daily Press. Sales in the UK’s biggest-selling morning regional newspaper have decreased by two-thirds since 2000, when its circulation stood at more than 75,000. Circulation has more than halved in the last decade to 25,600.Last week, Archant announced a landmark three-year, multimillion pound deal with Google called Project Neon. This will focus on local digital news run by the publisher’s chief content officer, Matt Kelly.The owners of Archant, which also publishes about 60 specialist and local magazine titles including London Bride and Pilot, have tentatively explored a potential sale of the business. Last year, talks were held with Newsquest, the UK’s second-biggest regional newspaper group, but they fizzled out.The business is also a potential takeover target, or partner, for David Montgomery’s new publicly listed National World venture. The former Mirror group chief has assembled a team of executives – including Vijay Vaghela, a former finance chief at Reach, formerly known as Trinity Mirror – to “buy and build” a regional newspaper group. Montgomery is also eyeing a bid for JPI Media, which owns titles including the Scotsman, Yorkshire Post and the i, which is up for sale.However, any potential buyer will have to deal with Archant’s pension deficit, which stands at about £30m. Archant sold its loss-making local TV station, Mustard TV, to That’s TV in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9adf199ee34a97f4a616ae286addfb3d52c5417b/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e13cb6eefbc27ad6930201103a1296c","title":"how to your way into an ivy league school","story":"Journalist Evgenia Peretz discusses how US college tutor Rick Singer persuaded so many parents to take part in one of the biggest university scandals the Department of Justice has ever prosecuted.

Labour has been gifted victory. What does it conspire to do? Punch itself in the faceYesterday was a very good day to bury a bad conference. Three weeks ago, rapidly oxidising political genius Dominic Cummings briefed that the Tories were going to “wreck” the Labour party’s annual gathering. After three days in Brighton, it was hard to see how even Downing Street’s Eric Cartman could have done a better job of it than the party themselves. Maybe he could have made Labour go on for an extra day? Or had a few more Dadaist votes on their Brexit position? In the end, Cummings master-strategised himself on to the wrong end of a monster constitutional VAR decision, taking one of his “alternative branches of history” right up the jacksy, and delivering Labour the considerable benefit of averting people’s eyes from their unforced errors here.Sixteen hours earlier, Len McCluskey – who bestrides conference’s jugular like a colossus – had been telling the TV cameras the party’s shambolic show-of-hands vote on a Brexit position was a democratic triumph. “Everybody’s a winner here today,” the Unite boss beamed. “Everybody.” Oh Len. You should definitely tell that to the people I can still hear screaming “CARD VOTE?!?!?!” – in vain – in the hall behind you, having been denied the opportunity to #usepens. At a fringe event later that evening, it was mentioned that Jeremy Corbyn’s approval rating is minus 60, the worst for an opposition leader since comparable polling records began. “So what?” called someone in the audience. Madam, I am sure it is a sublime irrelevance.As usual, this conference featured a number of Labour figures and outriders dismissing the implications of the fact their guy is trailing to a man they consistently recognise as Britain’s leading useless shit. The general line is: “I’d expect Jeremy to put on X number of points in a campaign situation.” Good for you. I’d expect him to already be miles ahead of Boris Johnson, who, in the past three weeks alone, has lost control of Parliament emitted a primal grunt as one of his MPs defected while he was conducting prime minister’s questions failed to stop the Commons passing a Brexit extension law expelled 21 of his own MPs, including two former chancellors and his hero Winston Churchill’s grandson driven his own brother from the cabinet and politics whiteyed a policewoman during a speech in which he appeared to have stirred a teaspoon of ketamine into his tea before going on …I’m sorry, I’m going to have to crack open a new paragraph because that one got too long. Continuing with Boris Johnson’s September, then: the prime minister lost another cabinet minister, Amber Rudd, who in effect accused him of lying to the public continued to be heckled by multiple members of said public every time he went out, including a new father who lambasted him for the state of the NHS outside a neonatal ward declared himself the Incredible Hulk, only to be humiliated by the prime minister of Luxembourg after refusing to do a joint press conference because some people were shouting at him it was revealed that a model-entrepreneur-whatever, whose flat he reportedly used to visit between mayoring stints, received £126,000 of public money refused to answer questions about any of that and has now suffered the Supreme Courtjacksy interface. There’s more – so much more – but simply not the space.So yes: on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn was able to take to the conference stage to call for the resignation of the above guy. How is that for being born under a lucky sign? At that moment, and really quite by accident, he ended up looking better than Boris Johnson, even though he still delivers speeches with the same mesmeric vim your optician wonders: “And is it clearer with this lens … or without? With …. or without?” Corbyn somehow seems to get worse at it the more of them he does. A bit like Emma Watson in the Harry Potter movies.As you do when you have a radical and often interesting policy agenda, conference began with eye-catching, headline-frotting attempts to abolish deputy leader Tom Watson, a man democratically elected by Labour members. Even as the Supreme Court was handing down its judgment on Boris Johnson’s unlawful suspension of Parliament, conference delegates were still being handed leaflets bearing the headline: “SHUN TOM WATSON!” (If you’re not familiar with the joy of sects, a Labour shunning is much like an Amish shunning, except you don’t have to raise a barn afterwards.)Having failed to see Watson off, the Supreme Court news enabled Labour to bump his speech to the Wednesday morning so that Corbyn could speak on the Tuesday instead. Watson promptly tweeted that he would not be speaking at all. So we’ll never know whether Labour’s deputy leader would have been formally shunned. As he put it: “I’ll save the speech I was going to make to conference until next year.” And you can set your watch by that. As long as it’s one of those edible sweet-bracelet watches with a big fizzy face.Day two of conference dawned to news of the pending departure of Andrew Fisher, one of Corbyn’s very closest aides. Fisher’s was a mild sort of resignation, accusing the most senior figures in the party ranks of “class war”, “a blizzard of lies and excuses”, “a lack of professionalism, competence and human decency”, and concluding: “I no longer have faith we can succeed.” Only in Labour – and this genuinely happened – could Fisher then have had Sunday breakfast with Corbyn and his team in the full view of the conference hotel dining room. I do hope the waiter made the most of it. “Would you like a newspaper with your breakfast, Mr Fisher? I’m assuming you’ve read the Sunday Times. Ooh, what am I like – you’ve written half of it. Still, nothing some beans on toast can’t smooth over.”Light moments were in short supply. That said, Emily Thornberry opened her speech with some anecdote about falling off her bike and her life flashing before her eyes, and tapping her nose suggestively about some of the naughty fun she remembered having. Owing to the gesture being misunderstood, Thornberry was forced to clarify her position shortly after her speech, tweeting: “Just for the removal of doubt, I was channelling Kenneth Williams in the Carry On films when I tapped my nose, not Pablo Bloody Escobar!!!” Lol don’t worry, conference – the shadow foreign secretary isn’t doing her cocaine material, just the sexytime stuff. Hey – it’s what the Palestinians would have wanted.Like Keir Starmer – whose expression during Corbyn’s speech might have been that of a man realising he isn’t going to get all of the Infinity Stones in time – Thornberry was primarily preoccupied with getting conference to adopt a position in which the party would campaign for remain at the next election. The good news is we’ve found the only thing worse than the modern pox of “gender reveal parties” for couples expecting a baby. The bad news is that it’s Labour’s Brexit position reveal party, an event that now seems to have been happening for actual years. We will now have to wait until special one-day conference after the election to find out whether it’s a girl Brexit position or a boy one.Before the big vote, Thornberry likened this moment to the one in Star Wars where the rebels are trapped in the garbage crusher. “You get the hero standing in the middle,” she explained at one fringe event, “and the walls are coming in.” Please don’t tell me that Jeremy Corbyn is Han Solo in this – but go on. “The answer is not to just stand there and go: ‘Oh well, I’m right,’” explained Thornberry. “The answer is to get out of there.” Well, actually … technically, the answer is to get R2-D2 to disable all the trash compactors on the detention level of the Death Star. Or, I guess, get another R2 unit to disable the Labour powerbrokers who reckon it is better to achieve a show of loyalty to Corbyn than a Brexit position that doesn’t fill with dread the person who has to ring a civilian doorbell and explain it.I’m afraid no such R2 unit emerged. And for all the fire cover afforded by the Worst Government In History™, what happened here in Brighton still happened. Whenever the next election comes – possibly in about 15 minutes – Labour will go into it with a Brexit policy that we already know makes every shadow minister who says it on TV sound like a stone-cold dick. And which goes viral – in an avian flu sort of way – every time one of them attempts it. We will come to the farcical voting scenes via which it was arrived at shortly. In the meantime, it is to be hoped that Labour will soon vote, ideally via a show of hands, to convene a special conference to decide how badly they messed this one up.Do people notice? There is a classic Victoria Wood mockumentary on the making of Acorn Antiques, her brilliant parodic soap opera set in an antique shop. A series of entirely self-induced setbacks mean cast and crew have run out of time, and have to shoot an episode that will go out live. Backstage at one point during the broadcast, tea lady Mrs Overall is so taken up with a humblebrag anecdote that she misses her cue, and enters the scene without her crucial tea tray. Given most of the lines relate to the contents of that tray, she and the other characters are forced to mime holding one in the ensuing discussion about the various items on it. Clearly, it’s a disastrous and avoidable shambles, and there’s panic in the director’s gallery. “Shall we cut? Go back?” “No,” drawls the monstrous show producer with a smile. “We professionals notice. Joe Public never clocks a damn thing.”This high-handed insouciance is the preferred get-out at Labour conference, where needless rows and unprofessionalism are blithely assumed not to cut through. I spoke to figures from the top of the party downward telling me – and perhaps themselves – that the public doesn’t pay attention to the plotting and walkouts and so on. But guys … that still doesn’t mean you should do it?Joe Public does occasionally clock things that appear on the main news bulletins, however, and the decision to screen clips of Labour’s handling of the back-remain-now motion means it might dimly have penetrated the consciousness of those dim remainers. It really was some special telly.By way of a curtain-raiser, John McDonnell had conceded: “There will be a bit of banter.” In the event, there was bantergeddon (superseded 16 hours later by the Supreme Court banterpocalypse). After a closely run show of hands, this was the precise dialogue from the platform featuring the chair, Wendy Nichols, and Labour’s general secretary Jennie Formby:Nichols: “In my view it was carried.”So there you go. I’m not sure of the wisdom of bringing this democracy masterclass to a wider TV audience. At the best of times the rules and processes of Labour conference appear entirely impenetrable to outsiders. Composites, cancelled NEC meetings, late-night stitch-ups … What happens in the hall and beyond is partly The Glass Bead Game, the elaborate and rarefied pastime in Herman Hesse’s novel, whose intricacies and opacities take a lifetime to master. But it is also partly Boar on the Floor, a bonding parlour game featured in a recent Succession episode about a corporate hunting trip, which sees participants forced to crawl around the floor of a Hungarian lodge and fight for sausages, willingly or otherwise, in a game that had zero rules beyond the bullying whim of the terrifying paterfamilias. Sorry, I know we’ve already mentioned everyone’s favourite self-appointed Boar Master, Len McCluskey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c78fe20a17595f7d5a150542b7caab9c078cacb/0_99_5067_3040/master/5067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01348672a0c83dbec25df0b66ef4b746","title":"labour members back motion give all uk residents full voting rights","story":"Motion to extend franchise to millions of immigrants passes easily at party conferenceLabour members have voted overwhelmingly to give full voting rights to all UK residents, committing the party to extend the franchise to millions of immigrants.A motion tabled by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement was passed at the party’s conference in Brighton on Wednesday morning, after MPs were forced to rush back to Westminster to attend the newly reconvened House of Commons.As well as extending voting rights, the text commits a future Labour government to closing all immigration detention centres, ending “no recourse to public funds” policies and seeking to extend free movement rights to people around the world.The motion also opposed immigration systems based on a person’s income or “utility to big business”, and any caps or targets on the number of people moving to the UK.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, welcomed the motion and acknowledged it was now Labour policy. “Be assured, our plans for government include these provisions and a lot more, to make this country a better, more decent and more prosperous place,” she said.Only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens are able to vote in general elections, while EU nationals can vote in local and European elections.Extending the vote to the 3 million EU nationals living in the UK would have a significant impact on the outcome of any second referendum on Britain’s EU membership.Ana Oppenheim from the Labour Campaign for Free Movement and the pro-EU group Another Europe is Possible said it was “a source of shame for many activists” that the party’s 2017 manifesto pledged to end free movement.“Now we can move forward not only committed to defending free movement, but to giving migrants the vote,” she said. “If we win, the next election will be the last election in which people like me are shut out of the democratic process.”The home secretary, Priti Patel, was quick to criticise the move, saying Jeremy Corbyn did not believe in any limits on immigration. “Corbyn’s Labour even wants to extend free movement to more countries and allow potentially dangerous illegal immigrants to roam our streets,” she said. “The British people voted to take back control. It’s only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives who will deliver Brexit by 31 October and end free movement once and for all.”The conference motion read: “Confronted with attacks on migrants – from the racist hostile environment to the Conservatives’ immigration bill that plans to end free movement and strip the rights of working-class migrants – we stand for solidarity, equality and freedom.“Scapegoating, ending free movement and attacking migrants’ rights are attacks on all workers. They make migrant workers more precarious and vulnerable to hyper-exploitation, pressing down wages and conditions for everyone. They ide us, making it harder to unionise and push back.”Ben Towse, an organiser for the Labour Campaign for Free Movement, said the conference had made history by adopting a policy of “radical solidarity with migrants”.He added: “The next Labour government will now make history by immediately closing every detention centre, by granting democratic rights to millions of people, by extending free movement and by taking on xenophobic scapegoating lies with workers’ unity and solidarity, across the artificial isions of birthplace.”Many migrants in the UK have residence on the condition that they have no recourse to public funds, meaning they are not able to claim most benefits, tax credits or housing assistance. The policy renders many destitute and reliant on charities to survive.Celebrating the success of the motion, the Labour Campaign for Free Movement tweeted a photograph of the controversial “Controls on immigration” mugs produced by Labour during the 2015 general election campaign. “Now officially in the bin,” the tweet said.At the 2017 election, Labour’s manifesto said freedom of movement within the EU would end when the UK ceased to be a member. After Brexit, the party wants a close relationship with the single market, but it has not formally committed to keeping the UK in the single market, which would ensure free movement continued."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a2ba65ae420982be156a676607e3a4491001d2/249_187_1605_963/master/1605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd07ee16b322606b9beca1aad060e8cb","title":"scientists invent new technology to print invisible messages","story":"Messages can only be seen under UV light and can be erased using a hairdryerForget lemon juice and hot irons, there is a new way to write and read invisible messages – and it can be used again and again.The approach, developed by researchers in China, involves using water to print messages on paper coated with manganese-containing chemicals. The message, invisible to the naked eye, can be read by shining UV light on the paper.With the use of hot air from a hairdryer, the message can be erased and the paper reused.Despite digital communications and data security becoming more sophisticated, the study’s authors said finding ways to securely send hard copy messages remained important.“Data leakage has become a global problem with terrible consequences including outbreaks of war and severe economic and social issues,” they say in the study.“Although electronic media have become indispensable in our daily lives, paper is still the most widespread medium for information storage, and many important documents are still paper based.”Writing in the journal Matter, the team say other approaches to “secure printing” include the use of fluorescent inks that can only be seen under UV light. However, they say these have drawbacks, including that they cannot be erased and the paper reused, and are predictable – meaning the messages can be easily cracked.The new approach involves coating filter paper with a polymer that has manganese-containing chemicals, which can absorb UV light and emit green light, and then printing messages on this paper with pure water using an inkjet printer. The team said the materials have very low toxicity.When the pure water interacts with the manganese-containing chemicals, it disrupts their structure, hence their photoluminescent properties. The upshot is that while the message cannot be seen with the naked eye, it shows up as a dark drawing under short wavelength UV light.If the paper is heated under a hairdryer for about 30 seconds, the message disappears. So far, the researchers have managed to reuse the paper up to 30 times before it breaks down – with each print costing fractions of a penny.“If we can find a good substrate to replace filter paper, we believe the cycle numbers will be further improved,” said Dr Yun Ma, the co-author of the study, from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.The authors said the message did not simply disappear with evaporation of water in the absence of a hairdryer, and it can last for more than three months under ambient conditions.One possible explanation, they say, is that it might be necessary to melt the polymer coating to allow the necessary movement for the structure (and hence photoluminescence) of the manganese-containing chemicals to be restored after the water has evaporated. The team also took a different approach, using two manganese-containing inks to print a message and background on a different type of coated filter paper.The message cannot be seen by the naked eye or, importantly, under UV light since the similarity in the inks mean both it and the background emit light of a very similar wavelength and intensity under UV illumination. However, the message emits light over a longer period of time than the background, meaning it can be read using time-based imaging techniques.Developing this further, the team came up with an even more sophisticated approach that involves printing a series of numbers on paper using several manganese-containing inks, each of which emits light over a different period of time after UV illumination.By tracking the intensity of light emission over time, a new order of the numbers is revealed – allowing the code to be cracked. The paper can then be washed in a special solution and the same string of numbers reprinted with a different order of the inks to encode a different message.“This information decryption method possess an extremely high security level and might be promising in military and economic domains,” the team said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf7e1726bcfd08185d42621e70ef9fd2bee47a03/0_219_6579_3947/master/6579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4081064e41e80ba357f305dd2a12e37","title":"30 year child health study parenting alspac jean golding","story":"At a bright green table scattered with toys and juice cups sit Charlotte and her six-year-old daughter Amelia, while two-year-old Isabella races a yellow plastic shopping trolley across the floor. Being here is much more fun than school, announces Amelia, as she shows off the animal plaster that covers her (apparently painless) blood test to a smiling Professor Jean Golding.The emeritus professor of paediatrics and perinatal epidemiology at the University of Bristol is founder of the hugely influential Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (Alspac), better known as Children of the 90s (CO90s). She has just turned 80 and has just published her latest paper on child health.Charlotte, who doesn’t want her surname used, belongs to the original cohort of children, her mother recruited in pregnancy, while Amelia and Isabella are the third generation – the so-called Children of the Children of the 90s (COCO90s). Their arrival has made this study unique for the length, breadth and depth of its data on medical, social, genetic, environmental, and inter-generational factors affecting our health and wellbeing. Now involving 27,600 people, a biobank of 1.2m samples (including DNA, urine and placenta), and countless questions and answers, it has led to more than 2,000 research papers and had a significant impact on policy.The UK and US governments’ 1990s Back to Sleep campaigns (advising that babies sleep more safely on their backs) were informed by Alspac work, as was the US government shift to advise women to eat fish in pregnancy. And data from CO90s babies revealed that using peanut oil on infants’ skin – then common in baby creams – increased the risk of allergic sensitisation.Golding’s idea for Alspac was considered “crazy … impossible”, she admits, when she first proposed following every pregnancy in the Bristol area with a due date between April 1991 and December 1992, and then studying the parents and children as they grew. The big funders, including the Medical Research Council (MRC), refused to commit to “this monster”, says Golding, waiting almost a decade before getting involved in what Bristol University had started. “And scientists said it would never work,” she adds. “They said we should concentrate on one topic.”The whole point was to collect as much information as possible – including data they didn’t yet have a use for – maximising the ability to make unexpected connections. She wanted it to be open access too, and Alspac now has more than 800 registered users in dozens of countries. In the last six years, 1,000 COCO90s have been added to the cohort, and a further 2,500 are expected in the next five years as the CO90s tip into their 30s.The reasons aren’t yet clear, but Alspac is working on it. In the meantime, the finding has led to calls for better mental health screening in pregnancy and greater availability of treatment. As a child, Golding spent months at a time in hospital and contracted polio at the age of 13, which left her permanently disabled. Being ill so much meant she “spent a lot of time watching,” she says. “So I really am an observer.”Clearly clever at school, she only realised many years later that her teachers were fighting over which of them would get the kudos of sending her to read their subject at a top university. Her interests were zoology, psychology and chemistry, but the maths teacher convinced her that she would be unable to do lab and field work - “I had a calliper and on uneven ground I would fall down” - so she went to Oxford to read maths.“I attended the first statistics lecture and thought ‘this is rubbish’. They kept saying ‘approximate’. I don’t like approximate. I like to know exactly.” She switched to another branch of maths. She uses stats now of course? “Yes,” she agrees, “but with care!”She stood down as scientific director of Alspac aged 65, but her research is going strong. This month she published a paper showing that the children of mothers who take paracetamol in pregnancy (around half of mothers-to-be in Europe and America) are more likely to have behavioural difficulties, including hyperactivity in their early years. Though these particular difficulties resolve by age eight, Golding says other associations may come to light and advises, “pregnant women should reduce their intake of drugs, including over-the-counter drugs, whenever possible”.Her research results often bring surprises, she says. In her current work on “fascinating” transgenerational effects, she recently found that if the grandmother smoked in pregnancy (yes, the grandmother), the grandchild was likely to have a higher than expected birthweight but a slightly raised risk of autism and obesity. Traumatic events cascade down the generations, sometimes in unexpected ways. “Shock in one generation can be linked to a higher rates of obesity later on,” she says. “And one study involving grandparents who had been in one of the great famines of the second world war found that their sons have better mental health than others.” Golding is now studying families with refugees, war deaths and similar challenges in their background and is “open to any results”.Her other main focus is locus of control. This identifies people as either “internals”, who feel they have some control over their fate, and “externals”, who think life happens to them and there isn’t much point in trying to change it. “The main psychologist in the field pushed for us to include questions on this from the start,” says Golding, “and it turns out to have a big effect on the way people live and parent.Clearly, Golding isn’t retiring any time soon. “I think I have enough to keep me going until I’m 100,” she says. Meanwhile, younger colleagues are developing new techniques for direct collection of data – including via smart devices and miniature head cameras – and examining social media, both for its use in data gathering and the effect it has on us.Alspac’s role, Timpson believes, is to “make observations, explain them to government, push for specific policies and see practical change”. It’s a powerful model that has already proved its worth.Charlotte is gathering her daughters ready to go home. She has always been proud to be one of the Children of the 90s, she says, and she hopes Amelia and Isabella will be too. With luck, she adds, she’ll see their children joining as the COCOCO90s, bringing still more insight and improvement to our health and wellbeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae52cff26c1c2d75a13005d1c12ca2a8c072221d/3_128_6035_3623/master/6035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7a1a94d06315653facd37ce74140a99","title":"iaaf world athletics championships qatar","story":"The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, has said extra medical staff, ice baths and water will be brought in for Friday’s women’s marathon amid growing concerns about the extreme conditions at the World Athletics Championships in Qatar.But Lord Coe, who was re-elected president of athletics’ governing body on Wednesday, insisted there were no plans to cancel the women’s marathon or the men’s 50km walk on Saturday. But he insisted that protecting those competing was his first priority.“We have to be mindful of the welfare of the athletes,” he said. “We have a medical team who will monitor conditions all the time. We’ve undertaken a lot of work on heat management. We recognise that the road events are those that need to be carefully monitored. We have more medical supervision, more water available. There’s no plan to cancel.”Coe conceded that the race, in which Tish Jones and Charlotte Purdue will compete for Britain, would be tough but refused to be drawn on whether it would turn into a farce.“I don’t want to speculate on that, but of course I want as many people to finish as possible,” he said. “Our medical teams are going to be very good. The heat is actually not the big issue, the issue is humidity. That is the real challenge. We have extra precautions, we do have extra things out on the course. We have more medical supervision, more water available. But yes it is going to be tough.”IAAF also announced it had a budget deficit of $20m (£16m) but Coe insisted a new deal with the Wanda Sports Group in China made him optimistic about the future. “It’s has been a tough four years, there is no point being naive or coy about that,” he said. “I want the next four years to be the fun bit.

She hunches over and her body shakes. This is the painful cost of being the pioneer of women’s boxing in Britain. Couch was the five-time world champion boxer who was barred from fighting in her own country. Just over 20 years ago the British Boxing Board of Control still insisted women were too emotionally unstable to box.On my way to meet Couch I hear that Katie Taylor, the brilliant Irish boxer, will headline a bill at the Manchester Arena on 2 November with Anthony Crolla, a former world champion and much-loved Mancunian, on her undercard. Without Couch’s courage and defiance, Taylor would not be in this position.Couch had to win a court case against the sport’s governing body to make British sporting history in August 1998. Bernard Buckley, the board’s solicitor, built his case on the claim that “many women suffer from premenstrual tension which makes them more emotional and more labile and accident-prone. They are too fragile to box and they bruise easily.”But Couch had shown her mettle to win her first world title in only her fifth fight in 1996. She had flown to Denmark to face Sandra Geiger, the French world champion who came from a kickboxing background. Couch suffered a broken jaw, shattered cheekbone, fractured eye-socket, cracked ribs and a missing tooth but she still won a unanimous decision over 10 rounds. She and Geiger both ended up in hospital.Her world titles and landmark legal victory were of little benefit to Couch. She still struggled to get fights and there were many times when she travelled abroad and, after brutal bouts, was not even paid. At home Couch was shunned by boxing promoters and mocked on television and in the tabloids.I have known Couch since the late 1990s, when I first interviewed her, and she is one of the most admirable and kindest people I’ve met in boxing. She retired 10 years ago but today, as she relives the past trauma, her usual laughter is replaced by grief. When we take a break, because it’s so upsetting for her, Couch says simply: “I wish I hadn’t been the first. I wish I hadn’t gone through all that shit.”The 51-year-old Couch looks up when I say her scars seem more like wounds. “I’m damaged,” she says again. “I didn’t think I was but the counsellors and doctors encourage you to talk. They say: ‘It’s good to get it out. If you hold it in, Jane, you’ll only do more damage.’”She wipes her eyes and apologises for crying. Yet her tears are a sign of strength. They show her candour and fight. “I hope so. I just find it hard. It hurts my pride to talk this openly but I don’t think people realise the damage they did. Most of them had never met me and they’d call me a lesbian or a freak.”“Dinah messed them up because they thought she was going only on sex discrimination. She used that but focused on restraint of trade. I was already a double world champion and the board was stopping me making a living in this country. We won but, when I got the licence, I thought: ‘It will be all right now.’ The abuse got worse. Dinah knew it would happen. We left the press conference after the court case. She put her arms around me and goes: ‘I don’t want to tell you this, but your fight’s just beginning.’”Couch’s eyes are clear again. “I know what she means now. I’d be on TV shows like Richard and Judy and they would have phone-ins for people to vote. ‘Is she a freak? Should she be allowed to box?’ When people keep calling you a freak you think, ‘Maybe I am?’ Three years before I retired I would just sit on my own, crying. I couldn’t see a way out.”A year after she retired, in 2008, Couch had a breakdown. “I was very down. I didn’t want to go out. I was having panic attacks. Other women fighters were sending me messages about their problems. I had pains in my chest like I was having a heart attack.”A friend took Couch to hospital and “this amazing lady doctor told me I was having a panic attack. I was like: ‘How can I have a panic attack? I’m not scared of anything.’ I told her what I did and she said: ‘You’ve got to bury boxing otherwise this will always haunt you.’”Writing her book, and talking about it, has been distressing but Couch knows this is the road to lasting peace. “I wasn’t a skilful boxer. I fought with my heart. I learned that in the gym because I had to be tough – sparring with boys. Those first days in the gym were bad. They’d say: ‘Fuck off, you’re a girl.’ They laughed at me. They’re all skipping brilliant and I’m tripping over the rope. I could hear them laughing but I was thinking: ‘I’ll show you.’”Couch laughs at her youthful audacity. Before her first world title fight against Geiger she trained for nine months and sparred against well-known male professionals such as Glen Catley and Dean Francis. “Glen was a serious puncher but he was good with me. They were all good with me but they still hit me. They’d be no good to me if they didn’t. They taught me to fight back when you’re hurt.”Not one line about her becoming world champion was written in the national press or mentioned on radio or television. “I thought I was going to get mobbed at the airport but no one was there. I got Boxing News that next Friday. I was all excited but there was nothing. My manager shrugged. ‘They don’t do women’s boxing.’ He was as bad as them. A week later he said: ‘You’ve got a defence in New Orleans.’ I didn’t even want to go back to the gym but I convinced myself.”Couch cleared £200, after expenses were deducted, for winning the world title. But the New Orleans promoter said he had no money to pay her after she won another hard fight. At least she ended up having Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali’s trainer, and the great former world champion Matthew Saad Muhammad helping in her corner. Couch also talks about the kindness of Marvin Hagler and Lennox Lewis, and her friendships with Frank Bruno and Ricky Hatton. But her love of boxing has soured.“I wasn’t right a few years before I retired. I went on too long. We did the brain scan. They said: ‘Oh, you’ve had a slight alteration.’ I knew that meant brain damage. They said: ‘If you carry on taking blows it will get progressively worse.’ That’s why I retired.”Does she feel any side-effects now? “Yeah. The memory’s a bit bad. But that’s most fighters, isn’t it? Physically I’m not too bad but I became institutionalised, I think, to the other damage.”Many former fighters suffer from depression and Couch believes “boxing is definitely a factor. So many of my old sparring partners are in prison or on drugs or alcoholics. There’s got to be some connection with boxing when you look at all the lads in jail or on drugs.”Couch’s toughest fight was against Lucia Rijker in Los Angeles in 2003. Rijker is arguably the greatest female boxer in history and Couch survived 10 rounds despite having an eardrum perforated. “I thought I was brain-damaged because there was a roaring in my head and my balance was totally gone. I was swallowing blood and it made a cracking sound. I thought: ‘Seven rounds to go. The damage is done. I might as well carry on.’”After all the pain she suffered for such little reward does she feel any envy when hearing about Taylor’s headlining show? “Not a bit because I’ve buried it all now. What Katie’s done for boxing and women in Ireland is massive. I know because my fella’s Irish. She’s a superstar and that’s how it should be. It just wasn’t like that for me – or most women boxers today. I had a girl telling me her fight’s been cancelled because she didn’t sell enough tickets. That’s more typical of women’s boxing. It’s even been tough for Nicola Adams.”When she won gold at the London Olympics in 2012, Adams made a point of acknowledging her success would not have been possible without Couch carving out a path before her. British boxing’s great female pioneer is still fighting to win her own battle to overcome everything that boxing did to her. Does she feel as if she is winning?“I’m getting there,” she says with a little smile. “I’ve been with my partner Brian for nine years. We’re so happy. It’s helping me find a way out of boxing. It’s hard – but I’m happy when I’m not talking about boxing.”Jane Couch’s The Final Round is published by Pitch"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d330b3a73a3e64b8b3a7606768bc8d8192c2e21/257_157_3850_2309/master/3850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65aef9011d72dfb68a122bcbd475537d","title":"joe taufetee usa england rugby world cup japan","story":"The Worcester hooker is a try-scoring threat in an Eagles squad full of seasoned pros and determined to mount a challenge in JapanIn preparation for USA’s World Cup opener against England in Kobe on Thursday, head coach Gary Gold has worked his players hard. In the heat and altitude of Colorado, in the humidity of Okinawa, the pace has been so high that Joe Taufete’e, the biggest hooker in world rugby, has ended up a little less big.“When I got into camp in July,” he says, down the phone, “I had put on a little weight. I was almost 130kg. Now I’m sitting at 120 so you can see the amount of work we’ve put in. It’s been horrendously tough.”He’s not exaggerating. One morning in Colorado, he says, “We did this notorious climb, the Incline.”He can’t remember the number of steps up the side of a mountain in Manitou Springs – it’s 2,744 – because he was “too busy trying to find my breath. My soul got tested out there. It was more than 1k in uphill steps and after that we went on with this captain from the US military. You know how they carry big luggages in the army, about 30lbs? We went on like a 6k walk with that, and he kept the pace.“It was just horrendous, with the altitude as well. That’s not what our bodies are used to.”Gold’s point was that his men’s bodies are not used to the rigors of regular Tests against genuine World Cup contenders. In Japan, they play three in a row.The Eagles are all pros now, thanks to overseas clubs, the sevens circuit and the advent of Major League Rugby. They have a firm hold on Canada and they have risen to No13 in the world via historic results including a win over Scotland last year. But this will be different. France and Argentina follow England before Tonga offer perhaps the only realistic chance of a win.Taufete’e insists the Eagles aim to win every game they play but concedes that “looking at how England have been going, it’s not going to be an easy battle. But we fully trust in what Gary does and we believe he’s found a way into their DNA, and a way to try to exploit that. We know it’s going to take a lot of endurance to keep up with these guys but I know we’re going to have something for them.”Gold has extensive Premiership experience. So does Taufete’e, who has been at Worcester since 2016. He speaks glowingly of the set-up at Sixways, of living in Cheltenham, of wanting to stay in England for a while to come.He has described elsewhere how his wife, Noeleen, was responsible for his discovery of rugby. Taufete’e was born in American Samoa and raised in the San Francisco Bay area and was a defensive tackle in college football. Injury wrecked his NFL dreams but Noeleen’s family were stalwarts of Belmont Shore, one of the strongest rugby clubs in California and indeed the whole US. Partly in hope of impressing his date, Taufete’e picked up the other odd-shaped ball. It worked out.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterWhat’s less known is the impact on Taufete’e of a season in New Zealand, an experience which propelled him towards making a living from rugby and now, still just 26, going to a second World Cup.“It was through Belmont Shore, our president-slash-CEO. I don’t really know what his position is. Doug Pye. He’s just the guy who runs the club, you know? He had connections in Otorohanga, in Waikato, he had family there, and so after a promising year I had, the club asked if I wanted to go overseas and expand my horizons through rugby.“When I got there, you literally walk one mile from the entrance to the exit and that’s the whole town of Otorohanga. But they were just lovely people and I couldn’t believe I was there. I had family in New Zealand, in the Northland, so I was able to see them from time to time too.”Taufete’e spent six months amid the flying backs and fierce rucks of Kiwi club rugby, learning the game anew, “playing with some of the guys that played for the Blues, you know, and who played for Waikato”. It all helped him become a mobile mountain of a hooker who has also won caps at prop.“I kid you not,” he says, “when I came back from New Zealand, I saw the game differently. I think that was the year that I really took off … everything just opened up. I saw the field better, I saw the field as a Kiwi would.”If Otorohanga was a finishing school, it was old school. Taufete’e worked his passage “at a timber company that was owned by the owner of the club, and I stayed with him too. He was a great man, Graham Wilshier was his name, and he also took in a guy from Argentina way back who’s never left the side. He’s kinda become his other son. You can see the hospitality he brings. It was just a lovely time.Taufete’e says he had similar thoughts when he was first an Eagle, called up for the 2015 World Cup, training and playing with the likes of Samu Manoa. Just four years later he’s the hooker with the most tries in Test rugby, having passed the great Keith Wood with a hat-trick against Uruguay in March. Less-experienced Eagles, even hard-bitten pros like the Irish-born New York hooker Dylan “The Butcher” Fawsitt, now look up to him.He’s too modest to actually say that – he details a strong relationship with Fawsitt, his backup – but he undeniably has a lot to teach, off the field as well as on.The timber yards of Waikato were not his only other employer. In 2016, Taufete’e signed with the San Diego Breakers of PRO Rugby, the predecessor of MLR. But, he says, “with the struggles it had as a new company and league, it wasn’t stable enough for me to pursue it full-time. So I was working security with a hotel and driving to San Diego as often as I could.”MLR and sevens do not pay big bucks either. Many in Gold’s squad must make ends meet. As Taufete’e focuses on the challenge in Japan, he sees his own past toils as a positive. After all, the hotel job was a step up on what he’d done before, in a whole other school of hard knocks.“I mean, it was safe,” he says, laughing. “I used to bounce a lot in LA and Orange County. That nightlife was too much even for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77091c190b5ef097bd802eb9d593bbb4490d0c7c/1_0_2999_1799/master/2999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d738c48526abb397c9f0e06dce21b70b","title":"talking horses enable continues smooth buildup prix arc de triomphe racing tips","story":"Enable continued the smooth buildup to her attempt to become the first horse to win the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe three times, when she made what could well be her final visit to a British racecourse on Wednesday morning.John Gosden’s mare exercised under her regular jockey Frankie Dettori on Newmarket’s Rowley Mile course, covering a mile with the useful handicapper Crossed Baton and finishing just in front of her galloping companion.“I’m very pleased with her work,” Gosden said afterwards. “I wanted her to just stay with her lead horse and she’s had a good, healthy blow. It went to plan, and that doesn’t always happen with work mornings.“She’s going to have to be in top form to win the Arc. I don’t think she’s going to go winning it off what she did last year. You always have to be in top order to win a race like that.”Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager to Enable’s owner, Prince Khalid Abdullah, was also in attendance and confirmed that all has gone well in the build-up to her final race.  “Her preparation has been straightforward, we’ve had no issues and she’s been in good form,” Grimthorpe said. “It was a good, solid piece of work and just what everyone seemed to want to see. Frankie was happy with her.” Enable is generally top-priced at 8-11 to win her third Arc next Sunday, with Aidan O’Brien’s Japan next in the betting at 13-2.

She has looked a little quirky in the closing stages at times but there is little wrong with the bulk of her form and another step up in trip could see further progress.Air Pilot (3.40), a 10-year-old, is at least six years older than all five of his remaining rivals in the Listed Foundation Stakes but he remains relatively lightly-raced for a horse of his vintage and also has plenty of form with cut in the ground, including a Group Two victory on heavy going in April last year. He is worth an interest at around 5-1, along with Tukhoom (2.30) in the claiming handicap, while Lydiate Lady (2.20) and Round The Island (3.25) should both go well on the card at Redcar.

In a group that has more caps than any previous World Cup squad, an average of 45 per man, he’s a bolter. Yet to get on the field and gain a cap – that will probably occur in the games against Georgia and Uruguay – he has been on everyone’s radar since his Brisbane State high school days. It is great to see and fills us with excitement that we may be witnessing the birth of a new rugby star. It also got me thinking. Where are the teen sensations? Are there any more beyond the very rare exception of the young Queenslander?I remember coaching England Sevens when they faced a 17-year-old James O’Connor playing for the Aussies and he was full of risk and skill. He was to earn the first of many full international caps a few months later. Although he has put on a fair bit of bulk over the decade since, he was not the biggest then and I would question whether he would have got the opportunity so quickly if he was to emerge now.Petaia has no problems in the size department. At 6ft 3in and just under 100kg he uses his power to devastating effect and has a skillset that is excellent, too. However, without that physical presence to accompany the more subtle parts of his game, I don’t think he would have broken through so early. The mix of what is required has changed. You still need the foundation of core skills but on top of that an added level of physicality is needed that few teenagers possess.One player that cuts across O’Connor and Petaia is Manu Tuilagi. Again, I came across him at age grade and managed to persuade the then director of rugby at Leicester Tigers, Richard Cockerill, to let me pick him for a run out with England Sevens as a teenager in the London Floodlit 7s. He was ridiculously powerful, but I was also impressed with his skills. He could really pass and had good game understanding, too.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterIt’s easy for us all to point the finger at the professional game and say it’s all about power over skill, running into a face not a space. It’s even easier to say that about a player who looks made to measure for that role. Often that is unfair and these days you simply need both to play at the very highest level.The needle has swung more to the physical rather than the cerebral, and the way the game is officiated has fostered this, alongside the continued advances in players’ conditioning. After this World Cup, I hope World Rugby gets to grips with the ruck and the offside line and effectively de-powers and up-skills the requirements for a team to win phase ball. It has an opportunity to move the game away from Newton’s first law of motion and which if not addressed will mean by 2023 size will have increased influence.This gets compounded as the domestic game, to a large extent, moulds the players we produce. In England the Premiership has a level of physicality that is hard to ignore and that means for the majority of youngsters it’s going to take a bit longer to get to that point.Tom Curry and Joe Cokanasiga have those physical requirements and have hit international rugby hard – but they also possess high levels of skill and guile. Products of academies and the England age group system when John Fletcher, Pete Walton and Russell Earnshaw were still in situ, their all-round games were moulded and grown. Joined-up thinking – a rarity sometimes in the development of young players – was apparent and as we can all see, it worked. Would they be in this group if they were still teenagers? Possibly, but it takes me to the second reason for the lack of youngsters at this World Cup. Caps.Back in my RFU days, the performance department was almost hysterical in its desire to build a squad around the number of collective caps. It would argue you had to have a certain amount of international appearances in a group to be real contenders. So the chance of a youngster breaking through declined.Investment bias can also muddy the waters and a coach or management can become blind to evidence that contradicts initial selections. Players get kept in teams for too long because of that and younger players take longer to make inroads. It’s a skill to move players on at the right time, just as much as it is the same for players coming in and, twinned with the caps and the physical requirements, is the timing of their entrance in the cycle.Next year I am sure we will see more youngsters blooded. Eddie Jones has already introduced a number into England training squads and he should be congratulated for that. The same will happen around the globe as teams start the long muster towards France 2023. With the international calendar as full as it is, a new player could get close to 50 caps in that four-year period. The quality of young players’ skill and game understanding is still, by and large, there. However, the number of boxes they will have to substantially tick has grown and with the interpretation of the laws as they are, the need for size has only increased this. Twenty-two is the new 18.I’m just a little bit broken for Fiji after their defeat by Uruguay and I feel really sorry for their management in particular. Fiji had a short turnaround after Saturday’s opener against Australia and so had to use their full squad for this game. But they have known that for a long time. Currently their first-choice back row are all out injured, so they had to play second-row Leone Nakarawa at No 8, and that didn’t help either. I was at the game in November when Fiji played Uruguay at Hartpury College and it was one-way traffic in a 68-7 win for the islanders. So I can see a mix of short turnaround and injuries over complacency and poor kicking didn’t help Fiji in Kamaishi, set against the energy and passion and tactics that brought Los Teros all the 5050s. It’s brilliant for Uruguay but the defeat pretty much kills off Fiji’s chance of a quarter-final place and makes their game against Wales far less alluring, especially if Warren Gatland’s side beat Australia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62a3ab39521cfa7cf8b3ec1330a8a66a956ed749/0_23_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2f69ab5a9841920bfaaf6606ad3e502","title":"cycling road world championships 2019 mens time trial live","story":"An animated world men’s inidual time trial champ:His face says it all. The young Remco Evenepoel reacts as he is knocked off the top spot - and out of the hot seat - by a stunning ride by Dennis. The fact Evenepoel is even in the mix with a rider like Dennis, in the first pro season of his career, is astonishing in itself. His time will surely come.A word for that amazing ride by Filippo Ganna, who was third, from cycling writer Andy McGrath:To see a 19-year-old Evenepoel on the podium along with the 23-year-old Ganna is indeed quite something. Dennis aside, they have beaten a very high-class field of time triallists today.That Rohan Dennis interview, via the magic of video:A congratulation tweet to Dennis from his team, Bahrain Merida, is notable by its absence. He hasn’t raced for the team since he chose to get off his bike and go home in the middle of the Tour de France. In addition, he rode a blacked-out version of the BMC Timemachine TT today, the bike that also won him the title in Innsbruck last year. Riders are free to choose their own equipment when competing for their country, as opposed to the strict sponsor requirements at a trade team, but the fact he rode a BMC speaks volumes for his opinion of the Merida bikes.It’s time for the presentations, and “Advance Australia Fair” rings out across the fan park in Harrogate, with Dennis standing on the top step of the podium seemingly fighting back tears. He has clearly has so much invested in this, both emotionally and physically.Here’s a screengrab of the official top 10:Very, very emotional scenes as Dennis celebrates with his family:On the final straight, Dennis was pointed repeatedly at his own head, as if to say - “I am mentally strong enough to be world champion again.”After he walked out on his team at the Tour de France, there was a lot of speculation about if he would continue in the sport, and if he was suffering some kind of mental crisis. It’s clear that he disappeared from view in order to train, with everything being focused on this day, and the defence of his time trial title. He delivered, there is no question about that, and emulated the dominant ride by Chloe Dygart Owen in yesterday’s womens’ inidual time trial.On the final straight, Dennis was level with Roglic, but there seemed to be no congratulations forthcoming, and they didn’t even look at each other, despite being side-by-side. Clearly not the friendliest of rivals (unless they shared a big hug off camera).The double Dennis air-punch on the finish line:“Look, it’s been a tough year, obviously there’s been a lot of talk since the Tour de France about what I’m doing, but this was really special. It meant a lot to come here and really defend this title. I haven’t hung the bike up, I am still here to race, I am still to here to win, and I’ve got a lot more to give in this sport. It was good to really get out there today and hit it out and smash it.”Alex Dowsett (fifth place) speaks: “I’m satisfied. I did what I said. I got everything out. There’s a lot of work gone into this, and I executed it today as best I could. I am going to be looking at that gap to Rohan, and Evenepoel, and see what I can do to close it.”The Australian retains his men’s inidual time trial title. It was a massive, massive ride by the 29-year-old from Tasmania - a masterclass in bike handling, pacing and power. Dennis repeatedly punches the air as he crosses the finish line in Harrogate. His wife Melissa Hoskins is in tears as he goes to embrace her and their young baby. Dennis has had a tough year, all in all, but that was just a different class. What a talent he is.Roglic has managed to almost keep pace with Dennis after being overtaken. It almost certainly did him good to have someone to chase. Here comes Dennis ...Britain’s Dowsett remains fourth overall. Portuguese Nelson Oliveira, of Movistar Team, rolls in and is seventh-fastest.“He could even afford to have a small mishap now,” says Boardman of the stranglehold Dennis now has on this race. Dennis went through the second time check in 45’44”, 1’06” up on his nearest challenger, Evenepoel.Tony Martin rolls in, 1’18” down on Evenepoel, in seventh place. There is a close-up for Martin panting, sweating and wiping his face down with a towel. The effort these riders to put in is pretty insane.“It’s all gone pear-shaped for him today, and the form was clearly there.” Campanaerts also missed out on a Giro d’Italia stage win in May due to a mechanical. He has had some poor luck this year, but the Hour Record will be significant consolation.Maciej Bodnar, who comes from Wroclaw in Poland, rolls in to finish his ride - but he’s quite a way off the pace.Current top three to have finished: Evenepoel, Ganna, Bevin.Dennis breezes past Vuelta champion Roglic at the foot of a climb. Roglic started three minutes before Dennis. Dennis, for want of a better expression, is smashing this.Campanaerts is off the bike again! Was it just a mechanical? Not sure, but he is losing time. Unbelievable. Really bad luck, it seems, for the hour record holder. Meanwhile Evenepoel takes his place in the hot seat. Here is Dennis catching Campanaerts. Dennis is going like a train. Or like a really, really fast bike.The 19-year-old finishes in 1hr 06’14”  46” up on Ganna. Massive ride, but out on the road, Dennis is more than a minute up, and is looking in full control of this race.Chris Boardman sees a brewery on a helicopter shot, and can hardly contain his excitement. “One of my favourite buildings in the region,” he says.Luxembourg rider Bob Jungels rolls in. He is a phenomenal rider, but it’s not his day, he’s well down on the leaders.Here is Campanaerts, picking up the pieces after his crash. Dennis overtook him soon after this:Ganna, Dowsett, Kangert, Durbridge and Archibald is the top five. Ganna 6.77sec faster than Dowsett.Ganna tops the time charts right now. But is he Ganna be on the podium? We will know in about 30 minutes!It looks like Campanaerts has crashed. In fact, Rohan Dennis has just accelerated past him. This looks like it could be a masterpiece of a ride by Dennis.Lampaert, speaking about the crash that ended his hopes of a competitive time: “I went down quite fast, luckily with no big damage on myself. It is what it is. I wanted to finish the race, just out of respect for the world championships. It’s an honour to represent my country, and not finishing is not an option.”Respect, indeed, due to Lampaert too. Cyclists are tough.Thanks Paul Griffin for the email:“It’s not like a proper British Time Trial. AT ALL. None of the riders appear to have dressed behind a hedgerow there is no sign of finishers clutching a cup of tea in a polystyrene cup, and a slice of homemade fruitcake and most importantly, the roads are closed. It’s therefore not a proper test of bike handling under stress, as no fiscally conservative but loudly articulate car and van drivers are forcefully making the case for hypothecated road taxes through their vehicle window.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5432e52b58ad5e7ba3c69f8ba48b2c9db897f89/129_0_3735_2242/master/3735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eadd9c1754686ad1d51b924ad9f6678","title":"daxing international airport zaha hadid starfish opens beijing","story":"Daxing international, said to be world’s largest single-building terminal, to handle 72m passengersChina has opened a vast, multibillion-dollar airport in the country’s capital, in the run-up to a major political anniversary.Less than five years after construction began, the 450bn yuan (£50bn) Daxing international airport was officially opened on Wednesday in a ceremony attended by the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.China is preparing to celebrate its National Day on 1 October, marking 70 years since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, against the backdrop of unrest in Hong Kong and a flagging economy.The new mega-airport, the second in Beijing, was designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid in the shape of a starfish with five connected concourses. It is said to be the world’s largest single-building airport terminal. At 700,000 sq metres, with four runways, it is expected to be able to handle 72 million passengers a year by 2025. By 2040, the airport is expected to expand to eight runways and accommodate 100 million passengers a year.Officials have been showing off the sleek new airport for the past year, hosting tours of the space, which is to include customer-service robots to deliver flight information and facial recognition-enabled check-in.Critics have questioned the need for a second airport in the capital, especially one that is almost twice the distance from the city centre as the existing airport.Officials say Daxing will alleviate traffic pressure on the city’s existing international travel hub, Beijing Capital in the north-east, which had more than 100 million travellers last year, second in the world only to Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta, Georgia, in terms of passenger traffic.China is expected to surpass the US to become the world’s largest market for airport travel by 2022. But the aviation sector has a poor reputation for flight disruptions, the result of frequents delays caused by overcapacity and delays caused by the military, which controls most of the airspace. Officials hope the new airport will lessen those delays.Domestic and foreign airlines, including China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Air China as well as British Airways and Finnair, have said they will move all or part of their operations to the new airport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3522be675da9c1bcbc5d432a6ed702b1fee6a07c/0_0_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76c6c426e733f6be9c0f11586a898e8","title":"royal baby archie meets desmond tutu on south african tour","story":"Four-month-old makes royal tour debut with anti-apartheid stalwart, 87, in Cape TownArchie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor made a memorable royal tour debut by meeting the Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu in Cape Town.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, on a tour of South Africa, released video footage and photographs on their Instagram feed of four-month-old Archie’s introduction to one of the heroes of the anti-apartheid movement.Captioned “Arch meets Archie”, the 87-year-old archbishop emeritus of Cape Town is seen planting a kiss on the baby’s forehead during a 30-minute meeting with the couple at the historic premises of his Legacy Foundation, the Old Granary, a restored building built by slaves in the early 1800s.Tutu, effectively the leader of the liberation struggle during Nelson Mandela’s long imprisonment, said he was “thrilled” by the “rare privilege and honour” of meeting the royals.The couple have previously posted some of Tutu’s inspirational quotes on their Instagram page.During the meeting, which also included the archbishop’s daughter Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe, the couple joked about their son’s time in front of the cameras.Meghan said: “He’s an old soul”, while Harry commented: “I think he is used to it already.”Tutu-Gxashe, who is the chief executive of the Tutu Desk campaign, which provides portable desks for schoolchildren, predicted: “You like the ladies. He’s going to be a ladies man.”Tutu, who campaigned tirelessly for Mandela’s release, set up the legacy foundation with his wife, Nomalizo Leah Tutu, to help instil their values in the next generation of leaders.Its chair, Niclas Kjellström-Matseke, said: “We are enormously grateful to welcome the duke and duchess to our magnificent space, and for their love and respect for ‘the Arch’.”Prince Harry last met Tutu in November 2015 when the Queen named him as an honorary member of The Order of the Companions of Honour, in recognition of his services to UK communities, international peace and reconciliation. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1984 for his efforts in ending apartheid.After Mandela was elected as South Africa’s first black president, he appointed Tutu to head the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate abuses on all sides under apartheid rule."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4029283.1569356835!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and tusk seek written uk proposals on brexit by next week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar meets with British prime minister Boris Johnson during the UN General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York, US. Photograph: Michael NagleTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, have agreed the United Kingdom must produce written proposals to end the Brexit crisis next week.The agreement between the two men, which heightens the pressure on British prime minister Boris Johnson, was reached during a meeting in New York on the margin of the United Nations’ General Assembly\u0026nbsp“The withdrawal agreement is actually an international treaty. It’s not the kind of thing that can be amended or cobbled together late at night at the European Council meeting on 17th of October,”\u0026nbspsaid Mr Varadkar.“So if the UK does have meaningful proposals, changes that they would like to suggest to the withdrawal agreement or to the joint political declaration more particularly, we really need to see them in advance so that they can be worked through and worked up in advance of the EU summit.”He continued: “It’s essentially the way the European Union works. We have working methods, and I know that President Tusk and other EU heads of government would like to see British proposals in writing really in the first week of October, otherwise it is very hard to see how we could agree something at the summit in the middle of October.”Varadkar has also warned there is “still a very wide gap between the EU and the UK” on Brexit, despite a “good” meeting with Mr\u0026nbspJohnson in New York on Tuesday.Speaking following a 40-minute meeting between the two leaders on the fringes of the UN General Assembly, he said: “It was a good meeting in the sense that we were able to get into more detail this time. However, there is still a very wide gap between the EU and the UK in terms of achieving what we need to achieve before October.”Mr Varadkar noted it was the second time they had met in person. While the first meeting in Dublin had been a “chance to build relationships,” he said, Tuesday’s meeting “was a little bit more detailed. We got to talk about some of the detail of the withdrawal agreement and the backstop”.Earlier, the Taoiseach refused to be drawn on the UK supreme court ruling that said Mr Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful.“I’m aware of the decision that has been made by the UK supreme court. It is very much an internal matter for the United Kingdom so I don’t think it would be helpful for the Irish Government to comment on it.”Asked if he would join the calls for Mr Johnson to resign, the Taoiseach said: “No absolutely not. Whoever is prime minister of the United Kingdom is somebody we’re going to work with. It’s not us who decides the Prime Minister of the UK. That’s an appointment made by the Queen based on the composition of the House of Commons.”Mr Johnson, who was in New York for the United Nations meeting when the supreme court decision was announced, was due to deliver a speech to the General Assembly later on Tuesday as planned, before flying back to Britain overnight.Bilateral meetingMr Johnson also held a bilateral meeting with Mr Trump during the day. According to the White House, during the meeting the leaders “underlined their shared commitment to agreeing an ambitious free trade agreement once UK leaves the EU on 31st October”.Mr Trump also pledged to sign a “magnificent” and “exceptional” trade deal with Britain after it departs the EU in his own speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday morning.“We stand ready to complete an exceptional new trade agreement with the UK which will bring tremendous benefits to both countries,” Mr Trump said during his speech that was highly critical of the global trading system.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

We thank the administration for their support enabling this opportunity,” he said.“We believe deeply in the power of American innovation. That’s why every Apple product is designed and engineered in the US, and made up of parts from 36 states, supporting 450,000 jobs with US suppliers, and we’re going to continue growing here.”The company gave no updated release date for the new computer.

This is how our interactions in VR and AR can one day look. It can change the way we connect.”Mr Bosworth goes on to explain exactly how this technology works, stating: “You have neurons in your spinal cord that send electrical signals to your hand muscles telling them to move in specific ways such as to click a mouse or press a button.“The wristband will decode those signals and translate them into a digital signal your device can understand, empowering you with control over your digital life.”Following Facebook\u0027s announcement of the acquisition, CTRL-Labs shared a message across its social media platforms that it is thrilled  to join Facebook Reality Labs, however not everyone was happy about the news.Recent scandals involving how Facebook handles and uses people\u0027s personal data raised some questions about the ethics of such technology being used by the company.Great for them, disappointing for the rest of us, wrote tech analyst Azeem Azhar. Facebook needs to inveigle itself into our lives less, not more.CTRL-Labs’ wristband is not the only brain-computer interface that Facebook will be working on, having already unveiled a headset capable of transferring a person’s thoughts directly onto a computer screen.A paper describing the mind-reading technology was published in\u0026nbspNature Communications\u0026nbspearlier this year, revealing how the headset can decode brain activity to instantly transcribe what a person is saying into digital text.“We’re standing on the edge of the next great wave of human-oriented computing,” Facebook said at the time.\u0026nbsp“One in which the combined technologies of AR and VR converge and revolutionise how we interact with the world around us – as well as the ways in which we workm play, and connect.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But each app must ensure they actually turn it on, or they will just look as they always do.Instagram has not yet done that. It means that users scrolling through their otherwise dark phone can open Instagram and be suddenly hit by a blazing light white design, which can be especially painful when scrolling at night.Twitter is full of users requesting that Instagram finally add the feature, comparing opening Instagram to having the curtains pulled open after sitting in the dark.Now Instagram appears to be finally testing it out, giving some people access to a dark mode that will automatically switch on if a phone has the setting turned on in their phone\u0027s options.The dark mode appears to leave the rest of the design largely similar.

It was first spotted some weeks ago by an amateur astronomer, but has now\u0026nbspbeen given an official designation by the\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union.The 2I in its name refers to the fact that it is the second known interstellar visitor. Borisov is the name of the Russian amateur astronomer who first spotted it, and began the hunt for more information about our new visitor.It had previously been known as\u0026nbspC2019 Q4 but got its new name after being officially confirmed by the IAU, which is responsible for naming and cataloguing objects in space.The object is\u0026nbspthe first comet known to have arrived in our solar system. The first confirmed object, named Oumuamua, still remains largely mysterious – with astronomers still uncertain about what it even is, let alone where it came from or how it got here.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

In colour are active regions of the atmosphere of the Sun e.g. solar flares and coronal mass ejectionsThe new comet is destined to be less mysterious. Its journey means that it will be nearby for much longer, giving astronomers a chance to observe it more fully and hopefully understand more of its story.Scientists perplexed by mysterious alien space rock2IBorisov\u0026nbspwas first seen at the end of August by\u0026nbspGennady\u0026nbspBorisov, from Crimea. He noticed that it appeared to be a comet, based on the haze that surrounded it, and he turned out to be right\u0026nbsp– since comets tend to be named after the person who first spotted them, it was given his name.That distinctive tail is helping astronomers understand more about how the comet is making its way through the universe. Its current orbit suggests that it will be flying around the solar system for months, coming close to the Sun on 7 December and then flying out of the solar system.During that time, astronomers are scanning the visitor to learn as much as they can about it. That could help illuminate its origin and its destination, more about what it is made of, and how it could have been sent all the way to us – questions that could not be fully answered about Oumuamua, since it was spotted so late and was already heading out of the solar system before researchers could turn their attention to it fully.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it were about science it would be led by scientists, not politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.”When challenged by left-wing pundit Chris Hahn, Mr Knowles reiterated that she “has many mental illnesses”.His comments came after the teenager gave a severe and impassioned speech to the United Nations climate change summit, telling world leaders and officials from about 60 countries “I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope? How dare you.

Umar’s wife was among six Pakistani women and a Bangladeshi national arrested, and a huge cache of weapons was recovered.Tribal leaders, politicians and officials in Helmand, however, disputed this account and accused the US and Afghan forces of killing around 40 civilians, most of them returning from a wedding party on Sunday night, many of them women and children.Hamid Karzai, the former Afghan president, has been among public figures who has condemned the deaths and called for an investigation into what happened.Created with Sketch.Afghanistan war: lives of children devastated by the endless conflict Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andrew QuiltySave the Children220 Nooria*, 15 in the home her family has lived in for the past two years in Mazar-i SharifShe was forced to flee her home with her family after their town was attacked by armed groups.

It is not known to have a strong presence in India, but has received support from some Kashmiri separatist groups, including Anasurut-Tawhid Wai Jihad Kashmir.Four years ago, US forces raided an AQIS training facility in Kandahar, where they are believed to have established bases before branching out to Helmand, the former centre of British operations in Afghanistan.

Because of the heavy fighting, we did conduct targeted precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and US forces.”US officials say that they are attempting to establish whether women, apart from the ones they had captured, may have been hiding in the compound when the shooting and air strikes were taking place.Mohammed Zaman Hamdard, an official with the Helmand police force, said that the al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters had fled into people’s homes during the raid and started shooting from there, drawing fire back in response. As a result “three women are among the dead, and three children are wounded”, he stated.Karim Atal, a member of Helmand’s Provincial Council, said it had not been possible to obtain reliable information because mobile phones were not working in the area. US-led forces jam signals as a matter of routine during operations. “Some say 14 civilians were killed, others says 60, many are saying 40,” he said.Abdul Majid Akhunzada, a fellow council member, claimed that at least 12 people from a wedding party were wounded in the air strike, but he was unaware of their identities. Omar Zowak, a spokesman for the Helmand Governorate, claimed that three cars had been hit from the air, but the numbers of wounded were unclear.Read the first part of the Conflict Without End series here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption and the second part here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: ‘My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up’Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The tribunal found evidence they were “being used as a bank of organs” and subjected to regular medical testing.China has repeatedly denied the use of unethical organ transplant practices, and said that it stopped using the organs from executed prisoners in 2015.

My copies of the files will never be released unless something untoward happens to me.”When asked by the Mail Online about what information he has on the Prince, Dougan said: Do I have dirt on Prince Andrew  I have lots of things.But Im not a Kremlin agent and I did not share any materials with the Russian Government. I dont intend to blackmail anyone with my information.

this year that is October, , .Thanksgiving is a public holiday that began as a harvest festival.It is now celebrated every year and, along with Christmas and New Year, is part of the broader “holiday season”.The story goes that back in  Pilgrims landed on American soil and settled in an area they named Plymouth just south of where Boston is today.Unfortunately for those who had immigrated, they settled in the beginning of what turned out to be a harsh winter, meaning rations were tight and times were hard.When spring came the Pilgrims went out to plant and grow their own crops and were helped by a native American named Squanto.Squanto taught them how to fish and hunt as well as showing them how to plant corn, pumpkins and squash.With these new found skills they were able to store up enough food to be sure that they would be equipped to face the harsh winter months.The grateful pilgrims invited the Native Americans to join them for a huge harvest feast which has since become known as Thanksgiving.The tradition has continued for hundreds of years since and is celebrated with lots of delicious food and wine.The tradition has continued for hundreds of years since and is celebrated with lots of delicious food and wine.A typical Thanksgiving menu consists of roast turkey, stuffing, cornbread, green bean casserole, roasted sweet potato casserole and winter vegetables - a plate that resembles a British Christmas dinner.This is then topped off with a pumpkin pie with a walnut crust, and even pecan pie.Each year, the President of the USA pardons at least one turkey, which becomes the national Thanksgiving bird thats granted reprieve from execution.This has been a long-standing tradition for decades.In New York City, there is an annual Thanksgiving Day parade.From am to am Eastern time, revellers can watch numerous floats and entertainers make their way through the bustling streets.Many Native American people spend Thanksgiving in mourning as they reflect on centuries of persecution aimed at their people.Every year since , people have gathered for a rally and march in Plymouth, where the Pilgrims first landed from England, to reflect on the struggles their people faced at the hands of the Europeans - and still face.The organisers website reads: Thanksgiving Day is a reminder of the genocide of millions of Native people, the theft of Native lands, and the relentless assault on Native culture.Participants in National Day of Mourning honour Native ancestors and the struggles of Native peoples to survive today.It is a day of remembrance and spiritual connection as well as a protest of the racism and oppression which Native Americans continue to experience.For expats looking for a slice of home, or Londoners looking to get their Americana on, the capital will be buzzing with things to do to help you say thanks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bob couldn’t stand seeing it becoming so tacky.”Addressing the claims, a friend close to Terri at the time told Sunshine Daily coast that she is a good mother, a good community person and has the zoos best interest at heart.Steves daughter Bindi became a celebrity in her own right in the years after Steves death.By , the -year-old had her own show - Bindi The Jungle Girl- a bizarre fitness DVD complete with dancers and her own range of action dolls.As the Discovery Channel looked for the next big thing, there were reportedly hopes she could ‘do a High School Musical’, with the group’s chief executive proclaiming: “We think Bindi will be a big, big star”.Her rapid rise led to a wave of concern from critics and politicians, but Terri brushed it aside.“Bindi is lucky in that opportunities come in thick and fast – and they are turned down thick and fast,” she told The Times.“You don’t see Bindi endorsing some fast-food restaurant or a new trendy anything, because she’s a kid.”Terri herself also faced a backlash as she hit the publicity trail.A year after his death, she published the memoir, Steve And Me: My Le With The Crocodile Hunter, while hiring an American psychic to contact her husband at the zoo raised eyebrows.She was also forced to deny a romance with John Stainton, Steve’s best pal and colleague, who witnessed his death.Good luck with that, she told New Idea, saying Steve was a hard act to follow.An ambitious £million plan to expand the zoo hit the skids during the financial crisis, but last year a new water park opened and this April a £million partnership was announced that will allow visitors to camp over in glamping-style accommodation.While Bindi’s fame has never quite eclipsed her father’s, in  she won Dancing with the Stars and this July she announced her engagement to boyfriend Chandler Powell.With no mention of her grandfather, she said her brother Robert, , will walk her down the aisle.In an interview last year, she revealed her hurt over her treatment by Bob Senior and said she hasn’t received a single gt from him in years.“I remember, when I was still quite young, receiving a parcel in the mail from him, she told Daily Mail Australia.“I opened it with great joy and anticipation, only to discover he had opened and ed the Christmas presents I had sent him.“Heartbroken, I began to understand what it meant to have someone close to me hurt me in my time of need.”Bob is now believed to be living as a recluse” in a secluded -acre property called Camp Chilli, with signs ordering people to stay clear.Terri, meanwhile, laughed off talk last year that she was dating Russell Crowe, who has been a great supporter of their wildle reserve, and claimed that Steve remains the only love of her le.She said: “I haven’t dated anyone in the ten years since we lost Steve just because I feel a connection still with Steve, she told Access Hollywood.“You know when you take those vows, and say ‘we’ll be together as long as we both shall live,’ I really don’t think I would’ve marriedI hadn’t met Steve.And he’s very special to me and continues to be.As the battle for the crocodile hunters legacy continues, one hopes his family can find a way through their troubles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While a large percentage of the younger generation are genuinely concerned about the planet — and rightly so — how many of them are actually going to do their bit beyond the enviable opportunity to skip school on a sunny day and virtue signal with a hand-made banner Deliciously tempting though it may be to blame their parents, the simple truth is that up to  years ago, no one had even heard of climate change.Far from worrying about the planet heating up, I distinctly remember our geography teacher telling us that a mini ice age was coming.In the meantime, I walked or cycled to school every day, wore jumpers indoors in winter because we didn’t have central heating and baked in the stling heat of the summer of ’ in classrooms without the luxury of air-con.There were no ready meals, we ate simple food cooked by mothers who had grown up with rationing, the vast supermarkets of today didn’t exist and we didn’t have a freezer.The only “takeaway” in easy reach was a fish and chip shop and the first time we ever ate out was when I scraped a couple of O-level passes and my mum took me to the local Berni Inn to celebrate.Our milk came in glass bottles, we ate locally grown, seasonal fruit and vegetablesand I didn’t set eyes on an avocado or any other exotic foodstuff until well into adulthood.At school, I was taught to mend things, not throw them away, would wear something several times before my mother would even think about washing it, and only received new clothesat Christmas or on birthdays.We had one TV, didn’t even get a landline until I was and I didn’t go abroad until I was  — by boat, not plane.No one went on “a gap yah” and my mum would have killed meI left our tent at Glastonbury, because we used it for holidays in Wales.I could go on, but the younger generation’s collective eye-roll of boredom might cause a damaging tremor.Suffice to say,today’s kids are happy to strip their lives back to reflect the childhood we had, it would be a great step towards helping the planet. But it’s not going to happen.So, instead of the lame, “old people have ruined everything for young people”, mantra, all generations should be working together to not only do their bit at homebut to continue putting pressure on those who govern us and have the power to effect realistic, not idealistic, change for a planet that currently accommodates seven and a half billion people.Then the admirable young Greta can go back to school and get on with having a normal le.THE Duchess of Sussex has learned the hard way that making inclusive speeches and appearing accessible has its pitfalls.In other words, someone might ask you to dance. When everyone’s watching.Shortly after declaring to the people of Nyanga, in South Africa: “I am here with you as . . . a woman of colour and as your sister,” she was grabbed by the hand to take part in a traditional dancing display, an offer she could then hardly refuse.From memory, the inscrutable Queen’s “don’t touch me” demeanour has thus far prevented her from being urged to participate in anything beyond a bit of heavily stage-managed ribbon-cutting, but her more modern-minded children have had their dignity sorely tested by many a tribal dance.Prince Charles’s awkward sword dance in Saudi Arabia springs to mind, and the rictus “please make it stop” grins of William and Kate when shimmying with the locals on the Pacic island of Tuvalu in .But Meghan pulled off her global dance debut with cheery aplomb, rhythmically wiggling her hips in time to the music and deftly moving on before it got too eggy.As Strictly’s Craig might say: “Fab-u-louuuus, dahling.”Consequently, he and we Adele live “mostly on benefits” in a Brighton council house along with their three young children.Thankfully, working hard is in the psyche of the majority, so luckily for him we help pay for his self-indulgent lestyle choice.JAMES Anderson has been dubbed “Britain’s kindest plumber” after fixing the boilers of the elderly for free.James, , above, from Burnley, risked going bankrupt but is now hoping to extend his services across the country after receiving £, in public donations.A truly heart-warming story.But why don’t councils nationwide use cash from their parking fine coffers to employ a “James” to help the needy in their area It would be a far better use of our money than some of the daft initiatives they come up with.AROUND  per cent of us hide treats so they don’t get eaten by our partners or kids.The top ten hiding places include under the bed and in the car.Puh, amateurs.Mine’s the back of the vegetable drawer.A record  people took part and celebrated with a BBQ straight afterwards.DEMI Moores newly released memoir reveals she engaged in threesomes while married to fellow actor Ashton Kutcher.“I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be,” she says.Ah, yes, the perils of an age-gap relationship and the continual struggle to appear “on the same page” as your much younger partner.Ashton was  to Demi’s  when they met in  and, no doubt, his sex drive was at its optimum while hers was perhaps struggling for air under the pressure of bringing up her three children with former husband Bruce Willis.While you fancy a night in with a boxset and some Pinot, he’s wanting to leave the house at pm for a night of clubbing and group sex.No thanks.And don’t even get me started on all the times you’d talk about David Cassidy and they’d reply: “Who ”ACCORDING to SNP MP Joanna Cherry: “The UK Supreme Court has made the ruling necessary to restore democracy and the rule of law.”She adds: “Now politicians must make sure that ruling is respected.”What, in the same way they respected the democratic vote to leave the EU Sigh.

agenda","story":"First the BBC soap posted its lowest ever ratings, .million viewers for an episode back in June, and now respected BBC commentator Mark Lawson has pointed out the show, along with Coronation Street and Emmerdale, has become outlandish and ­unsustainable on account of the ludicrous number of rape victims and murderers.And that’s before you even start trying to calculate the number of Walford characters who’ve been abducted.Personally, though, I don’t ­remember a time when EastEnders was anything other than the most deranged show on television.I would’ve thought more obvious signs it had lost the plot would be Ben Mitchell’s six ­dferent heads, Phil Mitchell’s ­people smuggling operation with Barry Grant off Brookside and the surprisingly high number of ­characters who revealed they were gay in time for the opening of the show’s new LGBT bar.Which has to be the happiest ­EastEnders coincidence since The Queen Vic organised a “European night,” not long after the Brexit vote.It’s good to have your prejudices ­questioned, though, so I watched with added care last week to seeI’d been missing a trick, as the Square came to terms with the bloody aftermath of the pub siege.Hunter’s still dead, thankfully, but Keanu’s made a remarkable recovery from being shot at point blank range and Bex is up for something called a “Pride of Walford award.” The real focus of the drama, however, was Bobby Beale, who’s freshly released from prison and so traumatised he’s prone to taking drugs and wandering off into train tunnels.As would youyou’d killed your sister and undergone four head transplants.The cure for all this ­torment is classic EastEnders and actually a bit easier to believe than the idea Ian Beale’s new lodger is Rainie, the ­prostitute he had sex with the night daughter Lucy was killed.Bobby’s embraced Islam.He says: “It helps me see the good in people.”The show says it is “to counter negative representations of Islam.”No word on why these representations might be negative, of course, just as EastEnders never had any dramatic response or even a mention of ­Islamist terror attacks in London or three East End

During their  minute meeting Thandeka joked that Archie liked the ladies, saying heaposs going to be a ladies man. Little Archie, who was dressed in baby blue dungarees with matching socks and a white long-sleeved top, sat on his mumaposs lap during the visit.    He looked very interested in what was going on around him as Meghan bobbed him up and down on her knee, and he beamed on a number of occasions.

The -year-old immediately started frantically searching for Disney World holiday deals and found a similar but less-inclusive two-week trip for £,. with Virgin Holidays. But two hours later, when Danielle revisited the site with her husband Dean Quinnin, , to make the booking, the couple say they were disgusted to see the price had shot up to £,..

The toddler was with her mum and aunt on a shopping trip to a supermarket to buy treats for her upcoming birthday party. But as they were queuing to pay, Katrice vanished. She has never been seen since. Last night, police in Wiltshire made an arrest in connection with her disappearance from a military shop in Germany in . The man has now been released without charge, an Army spokesman confirmed.    Katrice was last seen at the forces supermarket on November ,  as her dad was parking the car. Her father, Richard Lee, a -year-old retired sergeant major, told the Mirror he had been made aware an arrest was due to be made. “We all want answers, we’ve been to hell and back over the past  years,” he said. “This arrest of course brings it all back and makes it feel raw. “As with parents in all cases of missing children, we want a happy ending but that might not be the case and we just hope that we will get answers.”    An Army Spokesman said: A former serviceman was arrested by the Royal Military Police on Monday September  in connection with the disappearance of Katrice Lee. He has now been released without charge. The search of an address in Swindon continues and the Royal Military Police are keeping the Lee family informed of developments. Katriceaposs family were living in Rinteln, West Germany, when the toddler went missing. Her father, Richard Lee, was a sergeant major in the th th The Kingaposs Royal Hussars. Katrice, whose family were originally from Hartlepool, lived with her dad, her mum, Sharon, and her older sister, Natasha.    The little girlaposs aunt, Wendy, and uncle, Clf, were visiting the family for Katriceaposs birthday party. On November , , Katriceaposs mum and dad took a trip to the supermarket with Wendy and her little daughter. Big sister Natasha didnapost want to come so stayed at home with her uncle. Dad Richard drove them to the store and waited in the car park while his daughter, her mum and aunt, went to get supplies for her birthday party. It was the last payday before Christmas so was extremely busy.    Little Katrice was adamant she didnapost want to ride in the shopping trolley and so her mum carried her while she shopped. When the trio finished getting supplies they headed to the tills but then her mum realised she had forgotten crisps for the party. Sharon put Katrice down and asked Wendy to keep an eye on her while she went to grab what she needed. But when she ed her daughter was nowhere to be seen. It is still a day that haunts Sharon.    She told the : Katrice was excited, sheaposd had her presents and she knew something special was going on. I didnapost want to push back through the crowds carrying Katrice, so I just asked Wendy to watch her for two minutes. I remember very little  about that day, my le changed forever - it was the beginning of a waking nightmare. Sharon has never blamed Katriceaposs aunt for her little girlaposs disappearance. The military police were leading the investigation but had to work with the local force as while it was an Armed Forces shop it was not on military premises.

The Duke of Sussex, who has previously spoken of his mental health struggles, told hold how he feels so “overwhelmed” by global issues that he can’t rise in time. Harry, , made the comments during the second day of the his visit to South Africa with we Meghan and baby son Archie. The couple visited the Auwal Mosque in the Bo-Kaap district, the first and oldest mosque in the country, where the Duke spoke to students from the local community.    Among them was Peter Oki, , an Anglican Christian, originally from Lagos, Nigeria, who moved to Cape Town five years ago and attended a Jewish school. Peter, who now studies politics and sociology at the University of Cape Town, said he asked Harry and Meghan what they wanted their “legacy” to be.  “Harry said that he often woke up and felt overwhelmed by too many problems in the world,” said Peter. “That sometimes it’s hard to get out of bed in the mornings because of all the issues. “But he wanted to use their  to enable grass-roots change and to try and create a better society.”    The couple also heard from Banzi Bottoman, , a Christian who attends Gardens Commercial High School. He told them: “Just because someone looks dferent to how I do, that doesn’t make me inferior to anyone . We need to build bridges between people of dferent heritages.” Meghan, who wore a floor- olive dress and cream headscarf, told him: “That was just so meaningful, it gave me chills.” Harry, thumping his chest, said:“You can feel that you’re speaking from here.” Earlier, the couple had been welcomed to the mosque by Imam Sheikh Ismail Londt, the Muslim community leader Mohamed Groenwald and Father Weeder, the Dean of Cape Town. They also met Father Michael Lapsley, an Anglican who was born in New Zealand but moved to South Africa to campaign against segregation during the apartheid era whose hands were blown off in  by a letter bomb.  In April , three months after ANC leader Nelson Mandela’s release from prison, he was sent a letter bomb by the Civil Cooperation Bureau, a covert outfit of the apartheid security forces. It was hidden inside two religious magazines that he was expecting in the mail. The explosion resulted in the loss of both hands and the sight in his left eye, together with seriously burns which kept him in hospital for several months. He said: “Shaking hands is obviously not natural for me so I went to hug the Duchess and her response was “thank you”.  “I received a warm hug from both Harry and Meghan, I could tell immediately they are warm people who mean well. I was only invited the day before the event so I was very honoured to meet them. “Harry immediately motioned to my hands and said ‘letter bomb ’ It was instinctive on his part and it was a good conversation starter. “In terms of Harry and Meghan’s visit, I believe their tone, the way they are speaking has been quite beautul. There’s a naturalness, a warmth, a genuineness that is communicating from them and they have been very well received.” During their visit to the mosque, the couple viewed the first known manuscript of the Qu’ran in South Africa, which was drafted by Imam Tuan Gurufrom memory while he was imprisoned on Robben Island.  Earlier in the day the couple joined schoolchildren at the stunning Monwabisi beach near an infamous crime ridden township where an alleged murderer was shot dead by pilive just hours before the royals’ arrival. There Meghan and Harry meditated with youngsters from the Waves For Change collective which teaches mental health skills and surfing lessons. During a a ‘power hand’ bonding exercise, where the couple were asked to declare their personal strengths, Harry cheekily ducked the task and invited his we to share instead. Meghan looked bashful as she tried to think of something and was told she might consider dancing her strong point, but she laughed and said no.

David Dosoudil, , travelled back home from Orlando, Florida, on Sunday night knowing full well it was likely to be his last voyage for the travel giant. He said he had no ideatheyaposd even be allowed to take off while the troubled airline teetered on the brink of collapse. But David, who has flown Thomas Cook jets for nearly  years, put his emotions aside and even assured his crew and passengers during the flight. He said over the radio: Easy guys, there are still some of us flying around here. But as they landed in Glasgow in the early hours of Monday morning, he knew the writing was on the wall and engineer then walked in and said ‘Itaposs over mate’.    David, of East Grinstead, West Sussex, said: It was then, locked in my room, with the responsibility lted off my shoulders, I started crying like a f***ing baby. Iaposm no captain anymore. The wings and stripes have no meaning. For the first time in my le,  years old, Iaposm officially unemployed. The saying goes, that a burden shared is a burden halved. I think thereaposs a great truth in that. So here is my story of the last day of Thomas Cook, rd of September , in command of one of the last three airborne fights into UK. The best company Iaposve ever known and quite possibly ever had a pleasure to be part of. Recalling his preparations for his last Thomas Cook flight, he said: “It was unusually quiet layover in Orlando, in our beloved Florida hotel. The usual warm cookies on arrival, everything ready for us, warm welcome from the ever so friendly staff.    “Most of us did a bit of shopping and then met for dinner in Cricketaposs, laughed, moaned and worried together as we always do and then went to bed.” Proud David said the last flight was made especially hard because he claimed the company had left them in the dark. “It wasnapost the best sleep of my le,” he added. “How will I look after the crew and passengers tomorrow, without zero information and support from the company  “What would everyone think, how will they sleep, how will they feel tomorrow  Will everything be normal, will we be even allowed to leave ” As he met with his crew he said they tried to treat it as any other flight. David added: “We have met downstairs at : local, five hours behind UK time. The inbound flight is early, theyaposre no planned delays. “Eight hours flight time disappointing and a little bit of a turbulence around Newfoundland. So I promise weaposll deliver : and itaposs gonna be mostly smooth flight.    “Weaposre supposed to leave two hours later and that was a strangely reassuring thought. “Itaposs Sunday, by midnight UK time we should be far away above US eastern seaboard. Nothing ever happens before midnight, surely.” He added: “When we got through the airport to our airplane, all the cleaning was done and most of the fuel was already on, passengers ready, with still more than an hour to departure. I mean, are we really in Orlando  “Both Shawn and Dean, our great engineers, were there. Perhaps a bit unusual, but in retrospect, Iaposm glad they were. Weaposve done everything as usual and been ready well ahead of time. “Everything was so painfully normal and ordinary. So we shook hands with the handling agents and engineers and parted ways with words of positive encouragement and the usual see you in few weeks.” He continued: “But you kind of know and see it at peopleaposs faces. The uncertainty and worries, checking their phones and looking for news.    “So many questions and no answers. Captains, they surely have answers for everything. And I thoughtthereaposs ever a moment to stand up in front of everybody and reassure in person, this is probably it.” He then had to make an emotional speech to his passengers and crew. “So I stood there, in front of  people and  of my crew, struggling with the intercom headset and trying to put into words what was on my mind,” he added. “I tried to smile and joke and reassure everyone weaposre still a company, we love our job and above all weaposre professionals to a core and for us all, itaposs just another day in the office and business as usual. “I knew theyaposre great team, even though I met most of them for the first time in my le. “Theyaposre Thomas Cook crew after all. I donapost really remember what I said in my eastern European accent andit made any sense to mostly Scottish audience. “All I remember were the peopleaposs faces, mixes of smiles and sadness and misty eyes all around, nodding heads and the clapping at the end of it.

Paula Blythe, , says she recently tried to take her own le while grieving the loss of her mum, Patricia, and worrying about her benefits, and claims she wasnapost treated compassionately by the Department for Work and Pensions. The mum-of-four, from Hull, says she fears her benefits will be cut and it feels like she has had to beg, steal and borrow to keep a roof over her familyaposs head. She told HullLive: There was no compassion for me when she died from the DWP.Theyaposre not sympathetic at all. I was made to feel terrible and like I had mental health problems.    Ms Blytheaposs -year-old mum died of heart failure on July  this year. She said she missed her work assessment appointment at the JobCentre the next day. She said she was shocked when the DWP applied a sanction for the missed appointment, which meant she lost out on money. The DWP has said the sanction was removed when it was made aware of Ms Blytheaposs loss and her payments have not been affected at all by this.  Ms Blythe, who worked as a carer and lives with her -year-old son, said she recently tried to take her own le as a cry for help. She said: I lost my mum in July and since then I feel like Iaposve had to cry, beg, steal and borrow to keep my head above water so I can keep a roof over my head for me and my son. Iaposve even tried to commit suicide as a cry for help as I just canapost face the pain that my mum isnapost here anymore and feel like nobody cares about me. Iaposm worried that my benefits will be stopped and Iaposll be sent back to work even though Iaposm having panic attacks and canapost leave the house. I just need to be left to grieve.  She added: Iaposve worked since I was , Iaposve got four kids that Iaposve brought up and raised and Iaposve got a mortgage. Iaposve paid my way into the system and Iaposm not just some baghead turning up at the JobCentre and begging for money because Iaposm too idle to work, I just canapost face it right now because Iaposm so upset. I was really close with my mum and she died of heart failure in [Hull Royal Infirmary]. She knew her time was coming. She was  years old and not well, but I just canapost accept that sheaposs gone.

We have a growing membership not just locally but nationally.“From a Dundee perspective some of the buses will help visitors recall a few memories I’m sure.“We are aiming to have facilities in place for the public to view the vehicles by the start of next summer.”Allan added: “There is some great history around the fleets that have operated in the city.“Some buses ended up in Canada and Malta of all places.“The ones in Malta are still in operation today.”The proposals for the new venture would mean the local area would boast a second transport heritage attraction, alongside the Dundee Museum of Transport.Allan added: “From my perspective I’ve always had an interest in buses and classical vehicles.“I know there is a growing interest in all things vintage and the former local services would be a huge draw for people.”Dean said the charity was keen to welcome new members ahead of next year’s scheduled opening.Those interested can contact admin@sbpgdundee."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photos-show-royal-visit-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-evening-times-takes-look-back-glasgow-39-s-political-past","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"old-albion-motors-site-39-s-new-lease-life-celebrated-glasgow-39-s-doors-open-day","story":"PETER Burt can still remember his job interview at Albion Motors in Scotstoun, more than  years ago."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-take-look-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times"},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-urged-follow-scotlands-lead-syrian-refugee-help","story":"The UK Government has been urged to \"follow Scotlands lead\" in continuing to welcome refugees from Syria."},{"url":null,"title":"first-passengers-holiday-return-glasgow-airport-thomas-cook-closure","story":"Holidaymakers affected by the closure of travel giant Thomas Cook have begun toto Glasgow as the first flight of customers landed in the city, fearing some may have been left behind."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-2-5m-library-move-lead-parkhead-revamp","story":"PARKHEAD Library could move into a new East End healthcare hub as part of a pound.million scheme which would pave the way for the regeneration of Parkhead Cross."},{"url":null,"title":"us-superstar-halsey-announces-hydro-show-pale-waves-supporting","story":"US superstar Halsey will bring her Manic World Tour to the Hydro next year."},{"url":null,"title":"almost-15-000-thomas-cook-customers-brought-back-uk-monday","story":"Nearly , Thomas Cook customers have been repatriated following the travel companyrsquos collapse, the Civil Aviation Authorityhas said."},{"url":null,"title":"emirates-hiring-glasgow-cabin-crew---free-dubai-accommodation","story":"Emirates are hiring cabin crew in Glasgow to join their award-winning team - with sensational perks."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-groups-urged-apply-share-funding-pot","story":"WHEN you are a grassroots group fighting for every last penny, a windfall of any size is a fantastic boost."},{"url":null,"title":"cameras-reveal-life-behind-scenes-evening-times","story":"BREAKING news and landing a huge Scottish football scoop are at the heart of tonightrsquos fly-on-the-wall look at the Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"susan-aitken-fate-future-generations-depends-upon-ability-take-radical-action-climate-change","story":"WE live in truly historic times.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible.

Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

As such there will be no loss of natural daylight or visual intrusion to the nearby houses.#Whilst there will be windows to a staff room and staff office in the rear elevation, given the distance to the houses, oblique angles of orientation and intervening vegetation, there will be no loss of privacy by reason of overlooking with reference to policy guidance.#However, the proximity of the site to the rear gardens does warrant restriction of construction hours in order to protect residential amenities during the building period.#"},{"url":null,"title":"west goes wild for coasts and waters","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first ever pan west coast Scotland tourism campaign has received funding support from VisitScotland.West Coast Waters, bringing together an unprecedented  industry groups from across Scotland’s west coast, has received a £, VisitScotland Growth Fund award.

This area is also very popular with families who picnic on the flat land beside the river. Haylodge Park has always been a well-manicured park and this is what makes it such a beautul place to visit and use.He questioned whether the plans had been ldquoproperly thought through given that such meadows require upkeep and maintenance.He added: ldquoThese proposals seek to change the very nature of Haylodge Park which is central to recreational le in Peebles.ldquoThe intention to increase bioersity is a noble one, but where needs to be carefully considered.ldquoThe areas identied are heavily used, particularly along the waterrsquos edge and, in my view, should not change.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

The organ was out of action for two years while all the conservation work at St Michaelrsquos was being done but has been played again since mid-July.During this time a digital organ, linked to the kirkrsquos sound system, was used as a temporary measure.Restoration work to the Lewis organ, which is situated in the church sanctuary, included some leathering work to the bellows and electrical and mechanical repairs carried out including replacement of the old electrical transformer unit.The instrument was originally made by Lewis and Company, founded by Thomas Christopher Lewis , one of the leading organ builders of late th century Britain.Mr Shaw said further restoration of the organ would be carried out in the futurefunding was obtained. The Rev Malcolm Lyon, church minister since , was in post for two years before he heard the organ play due to the general church renovation work.ldquoThere was a note of dference on Sunday mornings for worship, he recalled. ldquoThe organ assists us in worshipping God.Mr Shaw retired at a meeting of the kirk session on Tuesday, saying the time was right to hand over the reins.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed.

and loneliness in the town.The project was officially launched in the summer in the community centre, with almost half of those attending signing up to volunteer.Similar projects exist in other places called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and sports clubs, emphasising community development and outreach.The project is helping tackle social isolation by encouraging GPs and other health professionals to refer those at risk of isolation to ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or all those non-medical things that might make the biggest dference to improving their health and wellbeing overall.Carol then meets the referred person to discuss their likes and dislikes, what is important to them and what the barriers are to taking part in community groups.She then puts the inidual into contact with one of her lsquocommunity connectorsrsquo related to a certain

them into it, said Carol.ldquoThe connector could give them a realistic sense of what the group is like.Connectors can also volunteer their time to accompany someone, for example, to the gym on a one-off basis.Others can meet someone over a number of occasions, providing them someone to talk to over coffee.Carol has also set up smallscale cafe meetings for those who would like to meet new people.She highlighted it was not only older people who were at risk of social isolation, referring to her own experience of losing her dad and becoming a new mother soon after.She explained how the experience left her ldquocompletely wrecked and thinking that everyone around her was coping very well.She said: ldquoThere are a lot of reasons people might feel isolated at some point.ldquoIf you have been through something that is a huge setback then your confidence is that much lower.As well as mental health, other reasons people could use Community Connections could be due to accident,

That we waved placards and then went home.The problems of climate change are so profound that itrsquos easy to show we care, but very hard to do anything practical about it. The stark truth is that iniduals recycling, cutting down on flights, using public transport or buying locally isnrsquot enough. Far from it. It will help ndashevery single one of us change our lestyle ndash but alone, inidual action is inadequate.The aim of the climate strikes is simple ndash to save the planet. If wersquore serious about that ndash and why wouldnrsquot we be ndash we need to face the fact that we have to radically alter the way we run our societies and economies. The bottom line is: we need to consume less as people and nations. That may sound easy, but it isnrsquot ndash it will entail massive disruption to our lives and economies. The challenge is: are we brave enough to accept these changes to make the world safe for our grandchildren :Operation to bring home stranded Thomas Cook customers to cost up to poundmWe fixate on oil and gas astheyrsquore the only demons in the climate change debate. The energy industry is certainly the greatest polluter of the planet by far, but we forget that farming produces .% of the worldrsquos carbon emissions. It takes  litres of water to make one litre of milk. Road travel alone accounts for .% of emissions. Deforestation .%. Cement production produces % of the worldrsquos carbon emissions. The chemical industry creates .%, printing .%.So the great problem to be figured out is: how do we rein in production and consumption in order to tackle climate change, while still maintaining economic growth, the guiding light of every government The collapse of the travel company Thomas Cook sits slap bang in the middle of this debate. Of course, Thomas Cook wasnrsquot destroyed by consumer choice linked to climate change ndash it collapsed due to commercial challenges from internet rivals. But the collapse proves two things: firstly, people arenrsquot travelling less, theyrsquore just travelling more cheaply with online companies not high street ones. So even as climate change becomes the biggest global issue, people are still not changing their lestyles in any meaningful way. They might recycle but cutting out a holiday  No thank you.Secondly, can we face more losses like Thomas Cook in order to tackle the climate threat  If we do become serious about change ndashwe feel production and consumption must be reined in to lower carbon emissions ndash then wersquoll inevitably have to face some companies suffering and perhaps closing. Is the answer a dreadful utilitarian choice: will some peoplersquos lives have to be ruined today to save the planet for the rest of us tomorrow Letrsquos look at lsquofast fashionrsquo as a case study. Cheap disposable clothing is a major problem when it comes to climate. The United Nations says the fashion industry creates % of all global carbon emissions. Are we comfortable with a high street fashion chain going under as a casualty of our climate struggle  Are we OK with people losing their jobs  Are we happy with the knock-on effect  For every redundant shop worker there will be fewer sandwiches sold in delis, fewer drinks in pubs after work. Less money.This brings us to the issue of lsquodegrowthrsquo ndash the biggest dilemma which we must debate as we try to go forward and tackle climate change. If you read economists whorsquove put their minds to the question of how we fix a planet which is at risk due to overproduction and overconsumption, therersquos little escape from the logical answer: we need to accept a limit to economic growth.This is a hard battle to fight. Degrowth can and will be portrayed by business and industry as a recipe for poverty. Itrsquos also an almost impossible sell to the public. Humans are inherently self-interested and short-termist ndash we canrsquot think of the next decade let alone next century. And the governments we elect are precisely the same.:Young people have a right to be listened to on climate crisisHowever, the other side of the argument is that recalibrating the economy away from oil and gas to green energy could trigger new economic opportunities. New energy sources like renewable hydrogen may well create new jobs. The narrative doesnrsquot need to be about decline and redundancies.With will and ingenuity, we could do the same for other industries like food, fashion and travel. But that takes fierce collective action, and we need a paradigm sht in our thinking. Some say that the move toward a green world will take a step-change in human consciousness along the lines of the leap from kingship to democracy. When Athens started playing with democracy in the sixth century BC, the rest of the ancient world thought the city demented. The idea that rulers were servants of the people seemed absurd.Can the intellectual leap we need to take to deal with the climate happen overnight  It seems impossible.And we are yet to properly debate the fact that many parts of the developing world are still going through industrialisation while we in the Global North obsess ndash rightly ndash over climate change. Is it fair that Western nations which had their industrial revolutions  years ago should tell poorer countries not to develop No philosopher, economist, or political thinker has answered these questions. There has even been discussion around lsquogreen authoritarianismrsquo ndash the idea that only a strongman-style of government, which tramples over inidual rights, could achieve the goal of forcing people, society and industry to change in order to save the planet in the time we have left to take meaningful action.What climate protestors have done is start a conversation. The people have called for action. Now governments must respond with policies and put them to the people.

A letime away from the sacred art of developing film or even inserting an HD card. Its this combination of old and new that allows us to evolve and maintain quality, while enriching what we can offer our audience.As a national newspaper the quality threshold is much higher but that does not stop questions being asked and assessments made. In last weekrsquos show, our brilliant photographer Kirsty was filmed waiting for two hours in the torrential rain with our competitors to capture Prime Minister Theresa May. As an editor thatrsquos a valued picture. As a manager thats not the most effective use of her time, albeit we didnrsquot know the PMs arrival was going to be as delayed.And that in essence is the choices we now make. There is no right or wrong just a matter of balance and understanding of our markets and reader expectations.Similarly, the roles and numbers of those involved in the production process have been streamlined as we have taken advantage of technology and put more emphasis on getting it right first time.:Queen lsquoshould resignrsquo for her part in prorogation, says MSPWould I rather have numerous eyes on the same piece of reporting or fewer eyes on that single article and more reporters producing more content Reporters can now use technology to write their copy straight onto the electronic page, adding their own headline and providing picturesrequired - and filing it to our websites with links to added or associated content. I very much doubt I could have mastered all of that when I set out  years ago but for young journalists being truly multi-media is second nature. An iPad is the new comfort blanket for toddlers!Again, for a national newspaper, there is a higher quality threshold and we still need to ensure all copy is checked at least once for errors and accuracy. The small team work incredibly hard regard casting their eyes over thousands of words every day. Occasionally a typo will slip by and I apologise.That makes for dficult conversations and in that respect, we are no dferent to many other professions. Hopefully, though it will come across clearly that my managers truly care about the people who work for them and show the same empathy, honesty and integrity that is the hallmark of trusted journalism."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Our gardens are the frontline of climate change","story":"As rookies, my husband and I are feeling our way at this horticultural lark.

That cost more than pound,.:All republican and loyalist marches this weekend banned by Glasgow City CouncilMr Livingstone told the Scottish Police Authority in Falkirk yesterday: ldquoThis has been demanding at an operational level but a strategic level as well.ldquoIs it sustainable  No, it is not. The capability of the single service comes in to bear. One of the officers injured was based in Dunfermline. We are drawing officers from right across the country away from their key role to respond to this.ldquoIn terms of sustainability, it is a signicant challenge. In terms of officer safety, there is a growing trend of attacks. There has been a signicant increase in the west of Scotland in particular. They are up by more than a fth.ldquoThe recent manestation of these marches, walks and protests seems to me to be part of a growing trend where our officers are coming under attack and it is utterly unacceptable. It is not part of the job.Referring to the last weekend in August and the first in September, Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr said: ldquoThose are officers who are not involved in investigating ndash as we want them to be ndash domestic abuse incidents across the city and tackling drug and traffic offences, and dealing with normal police business.BACKGROUND:Political polarisation fears over Glasgows  Orange marchesSpeaking of the first weekend in September, he said: ldquoSo there are a whole range of opportunity costs which are attendant and added on top of that pound, pure cost of the operation itself.ldquoThat being said, the chief has made it clear that to protect the city of Glasgow and its citizens we will deploy as many police officers as we need to do to make sure the city is both safe and feels safe.ldquoWe have set up an investigation team led by a detective inspector ndashover  detectives are involved in that ndash who are robustly investigating all the offences involved.ldquoWe have made  arrests so far. There will be more arrests over the coming weeks and months.ldquoWe will not accept that sort of behaviour. We certainly wonrsquot accept assaults on our police officers.ldquoOne of those arrests has been for the throwing of the pyrotechnic and one of our officers being injured by that.Police have also been hurt at football matches, including at Rangers Europa League home game against Feyenoord of the Netherlands.Mr Kerr listed problems: ldquoWe had six officers injured before and during that match. Throwing coins at officers. hitting them in the head and legs. Spitting on officers faces, kicking at their legs, throwing stones, one of which hit an officers in the face, punching officers to the face.ldquoThat is just wholly unacceptable. It cannot be right in  that we have officers deployed to protect their communities subject to that level of violence both at parades and associated protests or at football matches.Mr Kerr urged a sense of perspective. Citing his  years in Belfast policing, he stressed that only a tiny minority were involved in trouble. But he added: ldquoWe do need to have a clear, hard look at ourselves as to whether that is acceptable. We should not be putting officers in that position in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"papers-digital-journalism-contributing-bottom-line-herald-ever","story":"But that was the position I found myself in on day one when I started as Digital Editor at The Herald in November . Naturally, the filming crew didnrsquot miss a beat, capturing the everyday frustration and the ongoing issues faced by all departments amid a digital transformation.While the transition to a more digital focus for the paper has had its own challenges, as alluded to in the documentary, there have also been a number of positives as part of our digital transformation.There is a perception that the growth of online journalism has resulted in newspapers ldquochasing clicks and impacted the quality of the product, but the reality is that we know exactly what people read and what they want to engage with.:The Papers: Economic reality of trying to compete in new media landscape is under harsh spotlightEvery click on our site is monitored, we can tell what subscribers read, how long they engage for and what stories pick up traction on social media.The simple fact is that we need a ing site that generates income to pay for the high-quality journalism that we strive to produce. Media reflects society and in this digital age, with news consumed quickly, on mobile and through social media, we have tried to change our digital offering to reflect this.Online we continue to publish the same content The Herald is known and loved for, with all print copy going on the website, but we couple it with more analysis on hot topics, breaking stories and pieces that we know our readers want to read.It is this strategy that has seen a signicant growth in The Herald with our unique visitors almost doubling in a year, and . million more articles read online between September  and August .Year on year, The Herald is up byaround  per cent in online readership. Last month more than two million people visited heraldscotland, a record high for the year.The Papers also gives an indication of the challenges faced by the digital desk and the modern-day media overall, with The Herald being one of many papers facing cuts.While there is a perception by some that digital is simply giving content away, the reality is that digital is contributing to the bottom line more than ever before. As part of our strategy, we have focused on growing our readership and our subscribers.:The Papers: Why we let a BBC crew film The Herald newsroomBy doing this we have been able to implement a number of changes to improve our digital offering.The BBC documentary shows a window of time but by carrying out the changes outlined as part of our digital strategy, The Herald has been able to bring in staff and tailor content to our subscribers and growing audience. As part of our overall focus on digital, we have appointed a Head of Audience who oversees all social media, as well as bringing in a number of multimedia reporters both on news and sport.Training has been rolled out to all of our reporters and rather than creating separate digital teams across dferent titles, we have merged to become one digital desk that drives forward both heraldscotland and eveningtimes, providing consistency and more dedicated staff to the Scottish Newsquest sites than ever before.While improving traffic is key, we have never hidden that The Herald sits behind a paywall and more focus has been emphasised on premium content and building on our growing number of subscribers.We have continued to operate behind our subscription model and have seen a signicant uplt in the number of people subscribing to read The Herald since our new premium model was launched.With more readers supporting our journalism we have also added to the site navigation subsection, improved our video player on site, and carried out an in-depth analysis on our newsletters with changes expected soon.Regardless of the changes we make, no newspaper is without criticism, however, we strive to respond to our readers, and it is that transparency and engagement that we have tried to use to build our brand and trust online.While readers may not necessarily agree with an opinion piece or certain story, we have constantly looked to be open with our readers and to give them a deserved insight. And that was also a motivating factor in the decision to open The Heraldoffice to the BBC cameras in the first place.The filming allowed our readers to see behind the looking glass and an insight into le for staff at The Herald and the everyday problems we faced, but what it also showed was the dedication and passion that staff have for the product both in print and online."},{"url":null,"title":"sainsburys-closing-100-stores-major-business-overhaul","story":"The grocer said it expects to close up to  supermarkets,  convenience stores and  Argos branches.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"four fifths of our carbon footprint is down to our consumption habit","story":"Businesses that don#t act now to meet growing public pressure to tackle the global climate emergency risk being left behind.That’s the warning from Zero Waste Scotland which says organisations must do more and examine how they produce, consume and dispose of everyday items just to stay in the race – and urges them to embrace the circular economy.Zero Waste Scotland stresses firms achieving a more sustainable way of working would deliver huge results in cutting Scotland’s carbon footprint. This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A body recovered near Boddam is believed to be that of Ruairidh Sandison\"  A body recovered from the coast near Boddam is thought to be that of missing man Ruairidh Sandison. viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

This year Orkney boasts seven venues — some of which are participating for the first time,As far as local people are concerned, Doors Open Days is about getting into buildings for free and seeing things that you don#t often see. If buildings are usually charging an entrance fee they can take part by offering to open for free,The event benefits the organisations or venues by attracting more visitors. It helps them by becoming more involved in the community, as a volunteer or a visitor, and enhancing appreciation of local architecture and local heritage.The seven venues taking part in Orkney all have free entry.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment there is no travel insurance for the thomas cook employees","story":"Within hours of the Thomas Cook collapse, accusations were surfacing about rival holiday firms cashing in by hiking their prices. Meanwhile, the UK’s largest peacetime repatriation swung into action as the Civil Aviation Authority worked out how to bring , stranded tourists back home. Families turned up at airports not knowingthey were going to get to go on holidays, other stories surfaced about honeymoons and weddings thrown into chaos. It is, however you look at it, an appalling situation, and our sympathies are with everyone affected. Amid all the rolling coverage yesterday, however, one element appeared all but overlooked. The fact that , people, , of whom are in the UK have not lost their holidays with Thomas Cook’s failure but their livelihoods. While the £ million Operation Matterhorn is bringing tourists home, another looming challenge for the governments in both London and Edinburgh will be the thousands now out of work. The arguments over whether the UK Government was right to refuse a bail-out to the stricken travel giant will continue. There are questions around what it knew when and whether it could have stepped in sooner to prevent catastrophe. There is further anger over the lack of scrutiny of its actions caused by the proroguing of parliament. But none of that changes the simple fact that a -year-old business, a mainstay of the British high street for so long, has disappeared forever. Once the immediate challenge of repatriation is complete, efforts have to turn to supporting the Thomas Cook employees into alternative employment as quickly as possible. It is reassuring to see the Scottish Government has already made an offer of support through its Partnership Action for Continuing Employmentinitiative, and the support available on a UK-wide scale should be far greater.The thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos can retain some comfort that their holidays were protected by law and they will be refunded, albeit they may face a long wait. Others waiting to fly home, can be reassured that the Government will arrange alternative flights for them.The thousands out of work as a result of Thomas Cook’s demise have no such reassurance today. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"richard madden jack lowden kelly macdonald and jenna coleman to compete for bafta scotland honours","story":"TV mystery The Cry, which Doctor Who favourite Coleman starred in and was partly filmed in Glasgow, leads the honours race with Wild Rose, the hit Glasgow-set movie about a young country singer, played by Irish actress Jessie Buckley, trying to make it to Nashville after being released from prison.The awards ceremony, which will be hosted by broadcaster Edith Bowman in Glasgow on  November, will be screened by the new BBC Scotland channel, its first TV coverage for more than a decade.Organisers revealed that they had seen an almost of almost  per cent in entries in the space of  months and also hailed the ersity of the shortlists, following criticism in previous years about the number of women nominated for major honours.

Well done to all those who bothered to go out to make their feelings known, rather than sitting at home making supercilious comments online.Surely all Shetlanders are either incomers or the descendants of incomers John Ridland presumably wants to see some form of Apartheid with multigenerational residents receiving greater recognition and status.This rednecked social exclusionary nonsense just gets so tired. It might helpit can be appreciated that there are dferent types of Shetlanders, with all Shetlanders being equally valid.Maybe Shetlander is a state of mind, of wanting to care for, share in and build the community for the greater good, doing weel for the common weel and persevering.I sincerely hope John Ridland’s atypical attitude will one day be consigned to the dustbin of history.It should be challenged wherever it raises its ugly head.So far as he knows John did nothing worthy in a past le to be born in Shetland.He could equally have been born where.It’s the lottery of birth that entitles him to don that mantle and there is no need for him to be making others who also care for where they live feel unwelcome.Can he not see this inward and backwards looking approach is harming his community, not strengthening or celebrating it Shameful. #xenophobiasucks#getoveritYes Peter totally agree.Becauseyou went to live with the Pigmy people of equitorial Africa for several months you would be just as big a Pigmy as they are.That is because they #are just incomers or the descendants of incomers#.There is obviously no dference.The IPCC calls for collective international action and condemns unilateral actions e.g. #declaration of climate emergency#, as ineffective.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses.

Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"28k for woman sacked by northern ireland firm for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred. We apologise to Laura for the upset caused to both her and her family and hope that this ruling will allow them to move forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"all northern ireland paper 5 and 10 banknotes to be withdrawn from circulation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is crazy how nasty some people can be.\"We have had people saying how stupid we were for booking our wedding abroad and accusing us of trying to make a sob story out of it. We even had comments about my appearance.\"I am just devastated. I dont know how people want us to feel.\"People have been so mean and we are not looking for handouts or a sympathy vote.

It was also a lot cheaper than having a big wedding at home.\"The wedding was booked in April this year and cost the couple £, for the travel, hotel and ceremony. They feel fortunate that they had only paid deposits for the entertainment and reception.They have also forked out thousands on a wedding dress, three bridesmaids dresses and the grooms suit with three matching suits for his groomsmen, as well as flowers.To celebrate with friends who couldnt make it to Cyprus, they have also booked an evening party in the Seagoe Hotel in Portadown in November which they will now have to cancel.In total the couple have spent £, and believe with the money their guests have spent on flights and accommodation that a total of £, is lost.The couple spent Monday and yesterday trying to contact Thomas Cook without success.Natasha added: \"We dont want to go and get married really quietly for the sake of it, we want to do it right but we cant afford it now.\"We both worked so hard putting in long hours to save for our wedding and it was going to be perfect, everything I had dreamed of.\"We really have no idea what we are going to do now.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

the second major firm to face collapse within a week after holiday company Thomas Cook entered liquidation.The Unite union warned of “devastating consequences” for the workforce at the firm, which manufactured the so-called “Boris bus” ordered by Mr Johnson when he was London mayor but has struggled with cash flow problems.Angry workers described “silence” in the room as they were told the news during mass meetings in Northern Ireland on Wednesday morning.Stephen Wright, , a production manager from Ballymena, said it was a sombre atmosphere as more than , direct and indirect jobs were put at risk.“It is a very close-knit company and a lot of people were there a long time.“A lot of good friendships and relationships are coming to an end, so it is a sad day.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Staff members shake hands as they leave the Wrightbus plant in Ballymena Norman Stephens, a paint shop quality inspector, has worked for Wrightbus for  years.He said he felt sorry for company founder Sir William Wright, who had worked so hard to build up what was once one of Northern Ireland’s most successful companies.Mr Stephens said: “He built it from nothing with his father and now it has went to the dogs.”He said administration was on the cards five years ago.“Who is going to employ a -year-old man “I have nothing now, that is it.”Unite regional secretary Jackie Pollock said it was a workforce at the cutting edge of technological advancements in the design and supply of green public transport.He added: “We cannot afford to lose any more jobs or skills in this area.“Just three months ago, Boris Johnson gave assurances that he ‘will do everything we can to ensure the future of that great UK company’.“He has a chance today to do something decent.”Administrators Michael Magnay and Peter Allen, from Deloitte, said the ious Wrightbus companies had around , employees and the lack of a buyer “unfortunately means approximately , redundancies are being made today”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Metal cases for tools are wheeled from the Wrightbus plant in Ballymena Mr Magnay said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern.“We recognise the companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years.“We will continue to support employees through this dficult time.“The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.”DUP MP Ian Paisley said the administrator “has a week to find a buyer”.The North Antrim firm has been seeking investment or a new owner as it struggles with cash problems.Stormont Assembly member Jim Allister said: “My heart goes out to the hundreds with no wage packet this week or job hereafter.”Wrightbus has been a hugely profitable company in the past and based its business model on producing low-emissions vehicles.When Mr Johnson was mayor he announced a lucrative order to produce London’s distinctive red double-decker, an updated version of the original Routemaster.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A Routemaster bus passes through Piccadilly Circus, London Critics at the time said the new “Boris buses” were too expensive and estimated that the first eight had cost £. million each to design and build.There were also complaints that the new Routemasters, which were longer and heavier than other models, were unbearably hot, with later batches altered to provide windows.Mr Johnson visited Wrightbus during the EU referendum campaign in February .Wrightbus founder Mr Wright has been a prominent supporter of Brexit and the DUP, which has been propping up the Tories at Westminster.Northern Ireland’s manufacturing industry has been under pressure in recent years, with the slumping into administration of Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.Michelin Tyres

This point is not solved and this backstop needs to be in place as it is for them. We have already said from day one thatthey want to change the backstop, they can go to the one they first proposed because the backstop as it is now was at the request of the UK Government.”“It was not the initial proposal of the EU side or whatever European negotiator. We wanted a Northern Ireland backstop only and also for the good reason that the majority of Northern Ireland voted against Brexit, so let’s not forget that,” he added.Mr Verhofstadt was speaking at the first cross-party public hearing on Brexit in the European Parliament in Brussels on Wednesday and had not originally planned to speak.He said he wanted to respond to the ious remarks made by people at the meeting who live and work on both sides of the border.Mr Verhofstadt said he is opposed to a border on the island of Ireland and that “it is not just about avoiding physical infrastructure”.“It is also about the unity of the island economy. It’s about the single market of the European Union. It’s about the fallout of a border for the Good Friday Agreement,” he said.He said he visited the Irish border shortly after being appointed as head of the steering group – “to look to a border that does not exist”.“Besides the fact that there are miles on one side and kilometres on the other side, and that the signs are yellow and white.

prices, but only in the event of no deal.”The committee heard that airports at Dublin and Cork are uniquely exposed to Brexit in a European airport context, given the signicant traffic between Ireland and the UK.UK passenger traffic accounted for % of total traffic flows across EU  airports in , in contrast, UK traffic amounted to circa % of total Irish traffic.Mr MacCarthy concluded that, ultimately, the greatest risk for Irish aviation from a ‘no deal’ Brexit is the wider economic impacts on tourism and business.Failte Ireland has indicated at least , jobs would be lost in the tourism sector in Ireland, and believe there could be a loss of more than one million British tourists each year, resulting in the loss of  million euro per annum.“For this reason, we in the aviation industry, strongly believe that everything possible should be done to avoid a no-deal Brexit, in order to safeguard tourism and all the jobs throughout the country which are dependent on it,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan enjoying exciting mix of royal duties and motherhood","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through.

His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"door now wide open independent nw university derry university group","story":"A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has responded to the report on higher education published by Julian Smith.We welcome the clarity provided by this report and intend to respond in full in due course.At the outset, we wish to thank Lord Andrew Adonis, the Shadow Employment Minister Mike Amesbury MP and the Shadow Schools Minister Mike Kane MP for championing this issue at Westminster, and also the authors of this report.The Shadow Education Minister Angela Rayner has also raised the prospect of Derry availing of Transformation Fundingand we thank her for that proposal.On initial reading, this report provides a roadmap as to how the North West can develop its own autonomous university. The door is now wide open for an independent higher education institution for the North West.It provides us with a once-in-a-letime opportunity for the city-region, as long as we are prepared to grasp it. It is now almost  years since the campaign for a Derry university first began.Specically, the report raises a number of questions, which must be answeredwe are to redress what parliamentarians are now referring to as ‘the last-remaining civil rights issue’.These include:What legislation will be necessary to ensure that the new Derry-centred university will transcend both sides of the border, as regards teaching provision, RD, student intake and administration What legislation will be required from Dublin, London and Europe, to ensure revenue funding for a standalone cross-border university in the North West If a HE provider from Southern Ireland, where student fees are lower, were to become a partner in the new NW university, would fees here also be lower Is there any impediment to the National University of Ireland applying for a Charter to establish a university whose main campus is Derry  The report suggests that the institution seeking degree-awarding powers should be ‘physically operating’ in Northern Ireland. Can Derry Strabane Council be the anchor ‘operating’ partner, with NUI as the provider Can an accredited further education provider, such as the North West Regional College, apply for degree-awarding powers  What processes must it complete Derry Strabane Council is applying directly to the United Kingdom Governmentfor funding for a medical school for the North West. What action is council taking as regards applying to ‘UKG’, and other governments, for funding for an independent university for the North West Can Derry Strabane Council now operate its proposed Medical School with a new HE providerat Magee Will central government now increase the MaSN Cap, which restricts the number of HE students in the North, to accommodate the development of a new university in the North West Can central government ensure that the new independent NW university stays viable by ensuring that the minimum cap for the new institution remains permanently at ,  In February , the Department for the Economy, wrote to UU asking for ‘its rationale for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus’. Seven months on, UU still had not replied to its most signicant funder.

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the

continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving

leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

On Monday he was clearly angry that time was running out.POLITICS mdash A suggestion that South Down MP, Enoch Powell, should accompany a Down council deputation to Stormont was kicked out by SDLP councillors this week.The suggestion was surprisingly made by industry minister, Mr Giles Shaw, who has agreed to meet a council deputation to discuss industrial affairs in Down district.In a letter to councillors, Mr Shaw suggested that Mr Powell should be advised of the meeting and,convenient, should accompany the council delegation.SDLP councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, described the ministerrsquos decision as ldquoodd and said he had never come across anything like it before in his  years in government affairs.He thought the minister was ldquousurping the councilrsquos decision to form its own deputation and he believed the motive behind the suggestion was not altogether altruistic.He told councillors: ldquoWhat is happening is that a new precedent is being proposed to us. A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote. You are not worried whether people in the district get a job or not.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The streets of Ballynahinch will have Christmas lighting this year mdash at leastthe townrsquos Chamber of Commerce have their way.At a well attended meeting of the Chamber on Tuesday evening, it was unanimously agreed to purchase the lights in an effort to brighten the townrsquos main thoroughfare for the festive season.Whether they are erected and illuminated, stress the Chamber, now depends entirely on the business community and townspeople of Ballynahinch.This step forward was made possible by support from a number of traders in the town and the exhaustion of the chamberrsquos present funds.The Ballynahinch committee feel that what other towns in the locality have achieved they can emulated.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Councillor Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill said this week he is still hopeful that some industry can be attracted to the vacant factories at Castlewellan and Annsborough.Mr OrsquoNeill, who has been fighting for Government intervention since the factories closed last month, revealed that efforts have been made to attract new industries.He told a meeting of Down councillors that although nothing had yet happened, he believed that the efforts to attract new industries had been lsquoconscientiousrsquo.ldquoIt is a lamentable situation with two factories lying idle but I still remain hopeful that something will come out of it, said Mr OrsquoNeill.MOURNES mdash A planned motor cycle competition on the slopes of Slieve Donard in Newcastle has been turned down by local councillors.Councillors agreed on Monday that the event would encourage the improper use of the Mourne Mountains because it was planned in an area of outstanding natural beauty.ldquoEvents such as this should be discouraged to preserve the amenities of the area, said a council spokesman.The event, called lsquoEndeavour Motor Cyclersquo, was to have been staged by the Mourne Motor Cycle Club.DOWNPATRICK mdash Army bomb experts carried out a controlled explosion on an explosive device which had been placed on a windowsill of the Northern Bank at the junction of St Patrickrsquos Avenue and Market Street, Downpatrick, on Thursday evening.Police received a call at .pm stating that there was a suspect device at the premises and the bomb experts were called in.

So, do I belong to the IRA  I did not, never have, am not, and have no intention.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However, based on his own words in a BBC Spotlight film to be broadcast tonight, those denials were lies.Ryan, who is almost , was the critical link between Libya and the IRA as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi happily supplied guns and explosives to republicans so that they could attack their common enemy, the British.Speaking in the third instalment of Spotlight’s seven-part series on the Troubles, Ryan is explicit about his own role in illegal activities.Spotlight did not state whether Ryan still lives in Ireland nor did it explain why he has now decided to self-incriminate himself as has done.During the interview with the BBC, Ryan praised the Libyan dictator who was killed in an uprising in . He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.No Deal Brexit: As many , people in Republic of Ireland with U.K. driving licence could be driving illegally Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was. But we didn’t do too badly, no.”l Spotlight on The Troubles: A Secret History will be broadcast tonight on BBC One Northern Ireland and also simultaneously on BBC Four at pm.try catch  TrendingN.I.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Greenfield who seconded the motion said this legislation is ‘a step too far’. “As demonstrated in recent times thousands of people share the view that Westminster should retract this drastic legislation at the earliest opportunity, given its serious ramications and the manner in which it has been brought..”SDLP Cllr Joe Nelson said it was an emotional debate as there are very strong views on both sides of the issue. “The SDLP remains a pro-le party but has in recent times allowed members to have a conscience vote.

All members of the SDLP on ABC council voted in favour of the motion giving the clear signal that the SDLP group in ABC Council is very clearly Pro-Le.”Alliance Cllr Eoin Tennyson said the issue was ‘not black and white’. “Abortion is a conscience issue for Alliance. Personally, I would like to see decriminalisation, with access to free, safe and legal termination within strict gestational limits. I believe the best place for it to be considered is in the Assembly.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London.

This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
