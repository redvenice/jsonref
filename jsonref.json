It now has 238 lifeboat stations across the UK and Ireland.Father and son from Kent take migrant crisis into their own...\u0027People are thriving here\u0027: The Australian town that new...Share this articleThe South Coast, where most migrants have been landing, is served by stations at Dover and Deal in Kent. The active lifeboat at Dover\u0027s RNLI station is a £2million Severn class, the largest in the fleet at 57ft.The vessels at Walmer lifeboat station in Deal are a £214,000 B-Class boat and a £52,000 D-Class dinghy. Lifeboat crews are typically made up of locals living within five miles of a station who are notified of an emergency by mobile or pager.Mr Elphicke said: \u0027Everybody knows that most of these migrants are being rescued by the RNLI volunteer lifeboats, it is their duty to rescue anyone in distress in the high seas, wherever they may be from.          The South Coast, where most migrants have been landing, is served by stations at Dover and Deal in Kent (pictured: Kingsdown beach near Deal, Kent)\u0027And that\u0027s what they have been doing as their duty. They deserve great praise.\u0027 Mr Elphicke said he demanded the cash be made available to the RNLI during a meeting with immigration minister Caroline Nokes in Dover on Saturday.Of the RNLI\u0027s income last year, £49.1million came from donations, £135.1million from legacies and £5.5million from trading activities including the charity\u0027s 165 RNLI shops, which are run by volunteers. The remainder came from investment and charity income, according to its accounts.Its running costs in 2017 were £176million, and the RNLI spent £39.3million on capital expenditure, including lifeboats and launching equipment. A combined £114.6million was spent on the lifeboat service and equipment.The RNLI, which was formed in 1824, is reckoned to have saved 140,000 lives in its history.Mr Elphicke also called for the Government to return its two Border Force cutters from the Mediterranean to secure Britain\u0027s coastline, and provide relief to the RNLI. \u0027The first thing that needs to happen is to bring back our two boats from the Mediterranean to secure our coastlines and invest more in our border security to track down these trafficking networks,\u0027 Mr Elphicke said.          Mr Elphicke said: \u0027Everybody knows that most of these migrants are being rescued by the RNLI volunteer lifeboats, it is their duty to rescue anyone in distress in the high seas, wherever they may be from\u0027\u0027The Border Force cutters have a real role to play in acting as a strong deterrent and taking the pressure off the RNLI. I did make the case to Caroline Nokes that the RNLI have done incredible work, and that we should do the right thing by them. She listened.\u0027The RNLI and the Home Office did not respond to requests for comment.Ten alleged people smugglers have been arrested in France in just three weeks as part of a crackdown. Three men arrested last week and set to face trial next year are believed to be Afghan nationals who have masterminded a string of Channel crossings. Seven were arrested in the previous three weeks, according to the UK\u0027s National Crime Agency.Armed people smugglers – mainly Iraqi-Kurds – are regularly basing themselves in the makeshift camps dotted around Calais, making migrants fearful of speaking out.The rise in attempted Channel crossings has coincided with a spike in boats stolen from Calais and the nearby port of Boulogne-sur-Mer.\u0027We have lived with this problem for five or six months.\u0027 said Etienne Caron, the harbourmaster of Calais marina.\u0027It is my belief that the thefts and damage are the work of organised criminals – not big-time smugglers, just foot soldiers working to orders,\u0027 he added."},{"url":null,"title":"BBC Radio 2 DJ Sara Cox says school skirts old fashioned girls wear trousers instead","story":"    Telling girls to wear skirts to school is \u0027old-fashioned\u0027, BBC DJ Sara Cox (pictured) has claimedParents let themselves get \u0027distracted\u0027 by mobile phones...Thefts of disabled parking permits have soared 45 per cent...Share this article\u0027I think everyone should be in trousers.

I think we have to take a look at, seriously, whether or not the UK is allowed to trade.\u0027Because, you know, right now, if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us. And that wouldn\u0027t be a good thing. I don\u0027t think they want that at all.\u0027That would be a very big negative for the deal.\u0027          Trump and May speak at the G20 in Buenos Aires last month shortly after the US president said Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal sounded \u0027like a great deal for the EU\u0027Jean-Claude Juncker was hit by a furious backlash yesterday after he claimed most MPs \u0027deeply distrust\u0027 Theresa May over Brexit as talks appeared to stall again.The EU Commission chief told the UK to \u0027get your act together\u0027, and insisted it is not for Brussels to find a way through the impasse over the Irish \u0027backstop\u0027.Asked yesterday what the EU\u0027s future relationship with Britain should be, he said: \u0027It is not us who are leaving the UK – it is the UK that is leaving the EU. I find it entirely unreasonable for parts of the British public to believe that it is for the EU alone to propose a solution for all future British problems.\u0027My appeal is this: get your act together and then tell us what it is you want. Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.\u0027He said if MPs ratified the deal next month, talks on the future relationship could begin immediately and would not have to wait until after March 29, when the UK leaves the EU.Taking aim at MPs who claim Brussels is trying to keep Britain in the bloc, he said: \u0027I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May. It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention. All we want is clarity about our future relations. And we respect the result of the referendum.\u0027The intervention enraged MPs, with former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that Mr Juncker had \u0027picked on the wrong nation\u0027. He added: \u0027Juncker has descended yet again into shallow arrogance in lecturing the UK. They\u0027re trying to say it\u0027s the UK\u0027s fault, that they don\u0027t know what we want, but of course they know – this is just a stupid game.\u0027  Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured with Theresa May) has called on the UK to \u0027get your act together\u0027 over BrexitFellow Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said: \u0027Mr Juncker has severely underestimated the British spirit if he thinks the people of this nation will capitulate to his threats.\u0027Mr Juncker\u0027s intervention follows a heated summit earlier this month, which saw the Prime Minister confront him and angrily accuse him of calling her \u0027nebulous\u0027. Mrs May is still hoping Brussels will offer concessions on the Irish backstop to help it pass a Commons vote. MPs want \u0027legally binding\u0027 reassurances that the backstop – designed to prevent a hard border emerging in Ireland – will be time limited.Cabinet minister Liam Fox threw his weight behind Mrs May\u0027s deal, telling The Sunday Times that if MPs failed to back it in next month\u0027s vote \u0027I\u0027m not sure I would give it much more than 50-50\u0027 for Britain to leave the EU.A No 10 spokesman said: \u0027Discussions with EU partners have shown that further clarification on the backstop is possible and these discussions are continuing to secure the legal and political assurances Parliament need.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Model Twiggy Python star Michael Palin honoured New Years list","story":"Twiggy, pictured left in 1966 and right in 2016, becomes a dame in the Queen\u0027s New Year Honours List for her services to fashion, the arts and charityIdentities of 44 BBC reporters working in Russia are leaked...Krokodil and the flesh-rotting horror of the drug that EATS...Share this articleActor and comedian Michael Palin, pictured in 2014, is honoured in the New Year\u0027s listThe award, included among 93 announced by the Foreign Office in the Diplomatic Service and Overseas New Year Honours List, is for his services to travel, culture and geography following his successful second career as a travel writer and television presenter.

It has always been assumed that the Queen (pictured in front of the Britannia in 1983) would never put pressure on the government over an issue which was very politically sensitive at the timeIn 2003, a place spokesman told The Sunday Telegraph: \u0027Neither the Queen nor the Duke of Edinburgh have ever expressed an opinion on the way the issue was handled and nor would they do so.\u0027Yet writing to Richard Williams, a civil servant attached to the Cabinet Office, Sir Kenneth, who died in February, made clear the monarch’s interest in discussions about a replacement.He added that he hoped the ideas would be discussed in terms of feasibility first, and cost, second.‘It would not, I suggest, be a sufficient answer to all those who have contributed ideas to say simply that there is no spare money in the defence budget’, he insisted.          In an extremely rare public show of emotion, Her Majesty shed a tear on the day she had to finally bid farewell to a ship that had served her family for over forty yearsThe senior official also revealed that Prince Philip’s suggestion at the time was apparently to use parts of the Britannia in a new vessel.Professor Murphy, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, told the publication that the letter, in his belief, clearly shows that behind the scenes of the palace, ‘discrete pressure’ was being put on Whitehall to come up with a ‘positive proposal’.The idea to replace Britannia became an election issue in 1997, with Tony Blair’s Labour opposing the idea.Since then there have been numerous attempts to campaign for a new vessel, with 50 Tory MPs last year suggesting a special national lottery to raise the £120million needed for a new Royal Yacht.Britannia is now a tourist attraction in Leith, Edinburgh.           Britannia  (pictured in 1985) is now a tourist attraction in Leith, EdinburghI want a new yacht, Queen told Whitehall in secret letter | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Netflix announcement 45M accounts watched Bird Box met widespread skepticism","story":"    Netflix\u0027s \u0027Bird Box\u0027 has been watched by a record-breaking 45 million accounts in the week since it was released, the streaming service announced in a tweet on Friday.

Right: Raj as depicted in the book Bad Dad. Last night critics rejected the accusation as another example of pointless political correctnessHe said: ‘It’s a stereotypical character. To target a community and suggest that community’s shopkeepers are involved in selling out-of-date food is deeply unacceptable. It’s distasteful. In most cases these shopkeepers have been the fabric of their community for decades and I am uncomfortable with that joke.‘I’d love to have a conversation with David Walliams about it just to understand what his rationale is.’Veteran anti-fascist campaigner Gerry Gable, editor of Searchlight magazine, said: ‘Walliams is planting in kids’ minds that Asian shopkeepers are villains or not to be trusted. The whole stereotyping is disgraceful. It’s the same kind of stereotyping you would have seen in anti-Semitic literature before the war about Jews cheating in business. I find it really alarming.’But Toby Young said: ‘The people shouting “racist” are nearly always white, privately educated Lefties who’ve appointed themselves moral guardians. Raj ignores sell-by dates and tries to rip off his customers, but those aren’t things people associate with Indian shopkeepers. Those are just characteristics David Walliams has given him for comic purposes.’It’s not the first time Walliams has been caught up in a racism storm.He starred with Matt Lucas in the sketch show Little Britain, which came under fire for characters such as Thai mail-order bride Ting Tong. A 2008 report condemned the series for jokes that ‘pander to prejudice’.And last year Walliams was accused of ‘yellow-facing’ after dressing up as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un for a Halloween party.Walliams and his publishers HarperCollins declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Pippa Middleton strolls streets ultra rich enclave St Barts","story":"Happy holidays: Pippa Middleton, 35, carries her baby Arthur on the Caribbean island of St Barts with her husband James Matthews, whom she married last year, following behind  Pick up a Pop \u0026amp Suki bag like PippaPop \u0026amp Suki camera bag in cognacComplete the look with the strap below!Pippa Matthews has been spotted on a family holiday in St Barts, and showing off her chic sense of style, the new mum teamed a white blouse with blue denim jeans, but the real star of the show has got to be that brown camera bag!

In his meetings with Moon and Trump, Kim signed on to vague statements calling for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when or how it would occur.Post-summit nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang quickly settled into a stalemate as the countries struggled between the sequencing of the North\u0027s disarmament and the removal of U.S.-led international sanctions against the North. There continue to be doubts about whether Kim will ever voluntarily relinquish his nukes, which he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival.Kim and Trump are trying to arrange a second summit in early 2019. "},{"url":null,"title":"High Street faces decimated loss 10 000 shops year","story":"    The Local Data Company revealed the number of empty shops had risen by more than 4,400 in the first six months of 2018HMV has become the first high-profile Christmas casualty as the retailer has fallen into administration again, with more than 2,000 jobs at risk.  Professor Joshua Bamfield, of the Centre for Retail Research, said more jobs are expected to be lost from the £366billion-a-year retail industry next year.He told the Mirror: \u0027We are expecting about 10,000 shops to close in the next year.French newspaper Le Monde is forced to apologise after...Visits to shops fall by 44MILLION compared to December last...Share this article\u0027A few years ago you could say there were certain retailers that would never go bust but you cannot say that any more.\u0027Business rates are too high for stores to compete with online competitors.\u0027Retail analyst Richard Hyman said shops were fighting over ever-decreasing numbers of shoppers as more go online.Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u0027It\u0027ll continue to be a ­challenging retail environment over the next six months with another business rates rise.\u0027    HMV has become the first high-profile Christmas casualty as the retailer has fallen into administration again, with more than 2,000 jobs at riskHuge discounts of up to 90 per cent have decimated retailers\u0027 profit margins, even though shoppers spent a record £55 billion since Black Friday. Analysts say mega discounts have obliterated any profit for retailers from some of the cash going through the tills.SportsDirect reduced a men\u0027s Team Long Sleeve Polo Shirt from £29.99 to £2.99.

And that wouldn\u0027t be a good thing. I don\u0027t think they want that at all.\u0027That would be a very big negative for the deal.\u0027          Trump and May speak at the G20 in Buenos Aires last month shortly after the US president said Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal sounded \u0027like a great deal for the EU\u0027Jean-Claude Juncker was hit by a furious backlash yesterday after he claimed most MPs \u0027deeply distrust\u0027 Theresa May over Brexit as talks appeared to stall again.The EU Commission chief told the UK to \u0027get your act together\u0027, and insisted it is not for Brussels to find a way through the impasse over the Irish \u0027backstop\u0027.Asked yesterday what the EU\u0027s future relationship with Britain should be, he said: \u0027It is not us who are leaving the UK – it is the UK that is leaving the EU. I find it entirely unreasonable for parts of the British public to believe that it is for the EU alone to propose a solution for all future British problems.\u0027My appeal is this: get your act together and then tell us what it is you want. Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.\u0027He said if MPs ratified the deal next month, talks on the future relationship could begin immediately and would not have to wait until after March 29, when the UK leaves the EU.Taking aim at MPs who claim Brussels is trying to keep Britain in the bloc, he said: \u0027I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May. It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention. All we want is clarity about our future relations. And we respect the result of the referendum.\u0027The intervention enraged MPs, with former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that Mr Juncker had \u0027picked on the wrong nation\u0027. He added: \u0027Juncker has descended yet again into shallow arrogance in lecturing the UK.

So begins Jack London’s White Fang, published in 1906. The wolf pack is led by a wolfdog, Kiche. The ensuing story is told from the viewpoint of Kiche’s wolf pup, White Fang, through whose gaze we view the violence of the parallel worlds of animals and humans. White Fang is the narrative mirror of London’s earlier The Call of the Wild, in which a pet dog, kidnapped and used as a sled dog, runs away to join the wolves. Wildness is the true nature of animals, though the challenges of survival in the wilderness can also turn man into a beast, London seems to say. White Fang ends up enjoying domesticity with his new master, many miles away from the Yukon. Humans have triumphed over nature, but nature is still out there.In 1952 Konrad Lorenz, a former member of the Nazi party who would later repent and go on to win a Nobel, published King Solomon’s Ring in English. A chapter imagines the start of the relationship between humans and canines. A pack of jackals followed Stone Age man’s hunting expeditions and surrounded his settlements, and were tolerated, accepted and ultimately encouraged, for the warning barks they gave at the approach of predators, and their tracking skills. The jackals, which initially followed the hunters in the hope of scraps, began to take the initiative, running before instead of behind the hunter, bringing to bay larger animals. And so was created the covenant: food and warmth in exchange for protection.In Of Wolves and Men, Barry Lopez details the hate reserved for animals whom we cannot bend to our will. For centuries in the US, extermination was enacted against wolves. Lopez details the way they were treated as outlaws and criminals, subjected to public torture and execution. Crowds gathered to watch a particular wolf die as agonisingly as possible: drawn and quartered, and left to swing on the gibbet.“The way we think about other species sometimes defies logic,” writes Hal Herzog in Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat, which does a remarkable job of describing and explaining our emotionally complicated responses to animals. The truth is that, when we treat them with cruelty and indifference, this is often the way they treat each other. Animals, though, are not hypocrites, and Herzog must be applauded for calling out humans, among them “dog lovers” whose quest for the perfect breed has caused unquantifiable amounts of canine suffering.Karen Joy Fowler’s We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is a plea for the rights of animals and questions what it means to be human. A young girl is raised alongside a chimpanzee “sister”. When this animal psychology experiment comes to an end, Fern, the animal, is torn from the only family she has known and sent for rehabilitation in a chimp sanctuary. The casual cruelty of the act echoes through the family’s life for decades.Finally, how do we find a way to live together? In Coyote at the Kitchen Door, Stephen DeStefano details the interplay between urban sprawl and the natural world, which results in us living in closer and closer proximity to wild animals: the deer in the shopping mall, the cougar in the backyard, the bear in the senior citizens’ centre. Some, like the coyote and the fox, are so well adapted to urban living that all efforts to outwit them are certainly doomed.

It’s not surprising because his dark and strange tales are so inventive and stirring that they read as the male counterpart to Leone Ross’s recent first collection, Come Let Us Sing Anyway, with its amazing realist and magic realist concoctions around black women’s lives. Adjei-Brenyah’s stories are equally ingenious, but through a male lens and, like Ross, they’re so daring and mind-bending that you haven’t a clue where he’s going to take you.The opening story, The Finkelstein 5, is one of the most topical and devastating. A young man called Emmanuel talks about dialling his blackness up or down according to the situation. Speaking to a possible future employer on the phone, he code-switches his voice to “1.5 on a 10-point scale” of blackness, which won’t be possible when seen face to face. He knows that if he wears “a tie, wing-tipped shoes, smiled constantly… and kept his hands strapped and calm at his sides, he could get his blackness as low as a 4.0”. However, if he goes out in “a black hoodie, baseball cap and trainers”, his blackness rises to 7.6. The author cleverly expresses the pressures of assimilation and survival when you are from a vilified minority.Emmanuel is disturbed at the murder of a group of innocent African American schoolchildren by a white man who cuts off their heads with a chainsaw and tries to justify his actions in court. We’re not sure exactly how Emmanuel is going to seek retribution, but we sense his blackness will be dialled up in the pursuit of it.In Lark Street, a man encounters the apparently alive and definitely articulate twin foetuses of his girlfriend. Aborted by her the day before, they climb on to his pillow to talk to him. The tiny twins, Jackie and Jamie, refer to him as “Dad”, “Pops” and “Daddy” and accuse him of being weak. Jackie says: “I think I have more balls than you and I’m still, like, a trimester from genitalia.” Deadpan gallows humour and absurdism are motifs throughout this book, as the author takes you into the twisted tunnel of his imagination. The talking foetuses prove to be the personification of the man’s regret about the abortion, yet the story is too complex to read as a simple morality tale.The Era explores the impact of human genetic modification in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic society where knowledge and intelligence have to be relearned, while in Light Spitter, an isolated high-school gunman nicknamed Fuckton by his classmates, is confronted by the ghost of the young woman he’s just murdered. Together, they try and save another bullied child from going on a killing spree.Not all the stories are fantastical, but all of the characters seem to be trapped. One of the best is the eponymous Friday Black in which a successful store salesman, simmering in consumerist hell, uses his understanding of human behaviour to sell to customers who don’t realise they’re being manipulated. He hates his job so much that he takes extended breaks where he sits on the lavatory for 15 minutes at a time.Many of these stories are about outsider male protagonists, often in a deep state of suffering and desperation. Some desire social, self or peer approval. Financial hardship is a recurring theme. Sometimes, their tales are delivered with the extremes of hyperbole to explore a point other times, it’s the mind-numbing awfulness of the quotidian. Adjei-Brenyah is a versatile writer who creates a micro-universe with each story that explodes our expectations and takes us inside frustrated lives.Bernardine Evaristo’s new novel is Girl, Woman, Other (Penguin Random House, May 2019)• Friday Black by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah is published by Quercus (£12.99).

That suggests the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods at the US border are hitting demand.Mike Van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets says this data “may fan the flames of concern about slowing global growth”. More here.China’s stock markets have suffered a particularly bleak 2018.The trade war with the US has acted like a lead weight on many stocks, of course, but there’s also concern that China’s economy is weakening.“People have started to reduce or even stop spending money because they don’t expect the economy will perform well,” said Ye Tan, an independent economist based in Shanghai. “Companies and iniduals are wary about the economy.”Going into 2019, China faces not just a slowing economy but also a protracted trade war with the US, a pile of debt that threatens the world economy along with the Chinese financial system, and a populace demanding better environmental, labour, and health protections.Shanghai is closed today, as China prepares for the New Year celebrations. Investors deserve the break.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.It’s the final day of the year, and many investors will forgiven for wishing ‘goodbye and good riddance’ to 2018.The big worry is that the long bull market, which reared up after the great recession ended in 2009, is now over.Anxiety over trade wars, a slowing global economy, Donald Trump’s increasingly erratic behaviour and US interest rate hikes have all hurt stocks this year.In Europe, the tortuous Brexit negotiations and the long-running row between Italy’s populist government and Brussels have also worried investors.Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Management explains:We were surprised at the ferocity of the selloff in December which we put down to rising nervousness about the US-China trade dispute, an ill-judged and poorly communicated rate hike from the US Federal Reserve and an increasingly erratic pattern of behaviour from President Trump as the Mueller investigation into Russian collusion enters its final stages. “The last couple of weeks have seen a surprise unilateral decision to pull all US troops out of Syria, threats of a “very long” government shutdown if Congress refuses to fund the Mexican border wall and a counterproductive attempt to blame the Fed for market weakness when it’s the trade war that investors are most worried about. “Elsewhere in the world Theresa May’s chaotic postponement of the meaningful vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill has added to the jittery mood in markets, raising as it does the risk of a No Deal Brexit that would damage both the UK and euro area economies.Over the weekend, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping both made positive noises about a breakthrough in their trade talks, offering hope that deeper tariffs can be avoided.That is likely to give traders some much-needed optimism today. European markets are expected to open higher today, in a shortened trading session (although Germany and Italy will be closed)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c9c49fdd1a632681ad4e36e9c63c627ec705736/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=568cf5b7162965a9105c57f3c43f9fb3","title":"city life in miniature the tiny cement sculptures hidden across europe","story":"Isaac Cordal’s 15cm sculptures, part of his project Cement Eclipses, are a social commentary on the spaces they inhabitThe Spanish sculptor Isaac Cordal sees the city as his playground. He specialises in miniature street art, producing tiny figures as a social commentary on the spaces they inhabit.“My work is a filter to try to understand and change the world we have created,” Cordal says.His sculptures, about 15cm in height, often represent a social stereotype as a critical observation on capitalism, power and bureaucracy.In one installation in a puddle in Hackney, east London, for example, a group of men dressed in suits with apathetic expressions represent “a very archaic form of patriarchy, and capitalism”, he says.Cordal first models the sculptures in clay then reproduces them in cement.“As a material, it seems very symbolic because it is one of our most recognisable footprints against nature,” he says. “Today we have turned cities into a kind of natural habitat.”For several years he’s been working on the project, Cement Eclipses, referring to the state when a building covers the sun: “It’s a critical reflection on the idea of progress.”These tiny cement figures have appeared in cities across Europe, found sitting on top of bus shelters or drowning in gutters, small interventions in the big city. “The street became a perfect setting in which I could find infinite semantic landscapes on a small scale,” he says.“Due to their small size and colour they blend really well into the urban environment. They even normally go unseen by passersby. I’m very interested in that moment of surprise when someone accidentally discovers them.“Nowadays there is a fear of not being seen in the public realm, so everything is always big and bold.

The UK economy is too reliant on low-wage, low-skilled jobs, many of which are also insecure. While unemployment remains low, and in-work poverty is a serious problem, there is no good reason for ministers not to apply pressure to employers. Figures published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation this month suggest one in eight workers (4 million people) are now classified as poor. Working conditions and low pay are causing real suffering, with ambulances called to Amazon’s UK warehouses 600 times in three years. DPD delivery driver Don Lane died after missing medical appointments because he feared being fined for taking time off work.The review of the gig economy by thinktanker Matthew Taylor last year produced 53 recommendations, 51 of which ministers accept. Higher fines for employers who mistreat staff, and plans to inform workers of their rights on day one of any new job, are sensible. So is the repeal of a rule that allows employers to pay agency workers less than full-time staff. But a new right for zero-hours workers to request regular hours falls far short of union demands that they be entitled to them as a right. And details of the agency tasked with investigating and punishing abuses, and naming and shaming employers who fail to pay out after employment tribunals, remain vague. As with all regulation, the devil is in the detail of who, with which resources, has the power to do what. At the moment, workers in the UK bear a greater share of the burden of enforcement than in most European countries, with tribunals often the only recourse once an employer’s internal processes have been exhausted. It is almost two years since the economist David Metcalf was given the task of overseeing labour market enforcement, but his empire is small. It takes in a small team of employment agency inspectors, gangmaster licensing and the minimum wage (health and safety is separate). Given the scandalous scale of unpaid wages (estimated at £3.1bn in 2016, much of it holiday pay), and other failures highlighted by the Low Pay Commission and others, this regime is recognised as inadequate. But just as the government did not accept all of Mr Taylor’s recommendations, it has not accepted all those contained in Mr Metcalf’s first full annual report. Among measures rejected in December was a call for increased penalties for non-compliance.This is not the only grounds for scepticism. The no-deal Brexit that the government is preparing for would deliver a shock that these vulnerable, low-paid workers would not easily be able to absorb. In the longer term, inside or outside the EU, the UK needs a more resilient and more highly skilled workforce. This doesn’t diminish the value of the national industrial strategy, along with a workstream focused on workers’ rights, and the admission that flexibility has costs – sometimes far too high – as well as benefits. These are foundations that future governments should be able to build on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cee67b046446b625beb7b7a67debc6e570e42ca6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88d326694ef4cf06ae2453c0159e2a1e","title":"advertising academia controlling thoughts universities","story":"By abetting the ad industry, universities are leading us into temptation, when they should be enlightening usTo what extent do we decide? We tell ourselves we choose our own life course, but is this ever true? If you or I had lived 500 years ago, our worldview, and the decisions we made as a result, would have been utterly different. Our minds are shaped by our social environment, in particular the belief systems projected by those in power: monarchs, aristocrats and theologians then corporations, billionaires and the media today.Humans, the supremely social mammals, are ethical and intellectual sponges. We unconsciously absorb, for good or ill, the influences that surround us. Indeed, the very notion that we might form our own minds is a received idea that would have been quite alien to most people five centuries ago. This is not to suggest we have no capacity for independent thought. But to exercise it, we must – consciously and with great effort – swim against the social current that sweeps us along, mostly without our knowledge.Surely, though, even if we are broadly shaped by the social environment, we control the small decisions we make? Sometimes. Perhaps. But here, too, we are subject to constant influence, some of which we see, much of which we don’t. And there is one major industry that seeks to decide on our behalf. Its techniques get more sophisticated every year, drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience and psychology. It is called advertising.Earlier this year, the child psychologist Richard Freed explained how new psychological research has been used to develop social media, computer games and phones with genuinely addictive qualities. He quoted a technologist who boasts, with apparent justification: “We have the ability to twiddle some knobs in a machine learning dashboard we build, and around the world hundreds of thousands of people are going to quietly change their behaviour in ways that, unbeknownst to them, feel second-nature but are really by design.”The purpose of this brain hacking is to create more effective platforms for advertising. But the effort is wasted if we retain our ability to resist it. Facebook, according to a leaked report, carried out research – shared with an advertiser – to determine when teenagers using its network feel insecure, worthless or stressed. These appear to be the optimum moments for hitting them with a micro-targeted promotion. Facebook denied that it offered “tools to target people based on their emotional state”.We can expect commercial enterprises to attempt whatever lawful ruses they can pull off. It is up to society, represented by government, to stop them, through the kind of regulation that has so far been lacking. But what puzzles and disgusts me even more than this failure is the willingness of universities to host research that helps advertisers hack our minds. The Enlightenment ideal, which all universities claim to endorse, is that everyone should think for themselves. So why do they run departments in which researchers explore new means of blocking this capacity?I ask because, while considering the frenzy of consumerism that rises beyond its usual planet-trashing levels at this time of year, I recently stumbled across a paper that astonished me. It was written by academics at public universities in the Netherlands and the US. Their purpose seemed to me starkly at odds with the public interest. They sought to identify “the different ways in which consumers resist advertising, and the tactics that can be used to counter or avoid such resistance”.Among the “neutralising” techniques it highlighted were “disguising the persuasive intent of the message” distracting our attention by using confusing phrases that make it harder to focus on the advertiser’s intentions and “using cognitive depletion as a tactic for reducing consumers’ ability to contest messages”. This means hitting us with enough advertisements to exhaust our mental resources, breaking down our capacity to think.Intrigued, I started looking for other academic papers on the same theme, and found an entire literature. There were articles on every imaginable aspect of resistance, and helpful tips on overcoming it. For example, I came across a paper that counsels advertisers on how to rebuild public trust when the celebrity they work with gets into trouble. Rather than dumping this lucrative asset, the researchers advised that the best means to enhance “the authentic persuasive appeal of a celebrity endorser” whose standing has slipped is to get them to display “a Duchenne smile”, otherwise known as “a genuine smile”. It precisely anatomised such smiles, showed how to spot them, and discussed the “construction” of sincerity and “genuineness”: a magnificent exercise in inauthentic authenticity.Another paper considered how to persuade sceptical people to accept a company’s corporate social responsibility claims, especially when these claims conflict with the company’s overall objectives. (An obvious example is ExxonMobil’s attempts to convince people that it is environmentally responsible, because it is researching algal fuels that could one day reduce CO2 – even as it continues to pump millions of barrels of fossil oil a day). I hoped the paper would recommend that the best means of persuading people is for a company to change its practices. Instead, the authors’ research showed how images and statements could be cleverly combined to “minimise stakeholder scepticism”.A further paper discussed advertisements that work by stimulating Fomo – fear of missing out. It noted that such ads work through “controlled motivation”, which is “anathema to wellbeing”. Fomo ads, the paper explained, tend to cause significant discomfort to those who notice them. It then went on to show how an improved understanding of people’s responses “provides the opportunity to enhance the effectiveness of Fomo as a purchase trigger”. One tactic it proposed is to keep stimulating the fear of missing out, during and after the decision to buy. This, it suggested, will make people more susceptible to further ads on the same lines.Yes, I know: I work in an industry that receives most of its income from advertising, so I am complicit in this too. But so are we all. Advertising – with its destructive impacts on the living planet, our peace of mind and our free will – sits at the heart of our growth-based economy. This gives us all the more reason to challenge it. Among the places in which the challenge should begin are universities, and the academic societies that are supposed to set and uphold ethical standards. If they cannot swim against the currents of constructed desire and constructed thought, who can?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b1b3931c1a1eb5dda4c35d6e6f34d06556a7d51/0_179_4636_2781/master/4636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=478b9578991de738322e9e43539e4cdd","title":"men metoo power women feelings","story":"I realise now that #MeToo and Time’s Up were a wake-up call for the men who simply didn’t have empathy for womenAt the start of the #MeToo movement, many men expressed surprise at the number of women who had been the victim of sexual harassment and even assault. I was surprised by their surprise because I’ve lived in the world all my life. I’ve had to politely wiggle out of literal and metaphorical dark corners while working hard to create a narrative that this influential man’s suggestions were only an in-joke. I’ve had to protect my own bullies’ egos and reputations in order to keep working.But most of what I know, I know from what I’ve seen and heard from other women. The men of Hollywood seemed outraged to discover that the way they treated women every day, was the way women were treated. I will concede that some men didn’t understand the scale of it or couldn’t identify inidual perpetrators. I also suspect those same men didn’t want to know and had spent a lot of their working lives looking hard out of windows to avoid eye contact with women who were making SOS faces across tables.When the movement began, it was a series of salacious stories and – if we are going to be honest, as #MeToo requests – these stories were treated like titillating office gossip. “Into a pot plant? In front of her? Was this at last year’s Christmas party when Alan let off the fire extinguisher!?” It was only when #MeToo turned into Time’s Up, and there was talk of dismantling the power structures that allowed the worst of this horrorshow, that maximum fury was unleashed. Men might have been happy to hear about Louis CK masturbating in front of a double act in a hotel room, but they couldn’t countenance changing their own behaviours that contribute daily to the culture that allowed this to thrive. Action is difficult.Many men are actually very happy to leave behind a 21st century drunk-Don-Draper culture. They hate it too. But others are furious that these revelations mean their lives should change. Whenever I hear: “#MeToo’s gone too far now,” I think: “Well, that ‘women have to put up with any shit’ movement had a really good run.”When I first heard men saying: “I don’t know how to talk to a woman now,” I parodied it as: “It’s getting so I don’t know whether I can grope a woman in the workplace or not!” I truly believed all men absolutely knew the difference between friendly and lascivious behaviour. Of course men understand the difference between flirting and coercing … don’t they? Then I started watching these particular men’s faces while they spoke and I changed my mind. These men aren’t the same as the Hollywood lawyers professing shock at the worst allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Some of them genuinely don’t know. What we are witnessing here is some men developing empathy in public.What they are really saying is: “I have never thought to wonder how my words and actions routinely land with women. I don’t know how to behave around them any more because I don’t know what might feel embarrassing or predatory for them, even though I’ve dated women and worked with them all my life. None of my female friends would feel safe to tell me if I had a bad reputation.’’I’m not suggesting these same men have no empathy in general. They’ve developed empathy in all the places that society built consequences for them. The power structures have in-built penalties for them annoying their bros, but not for making a suggestive comment to a female colleague in a lift. Wherever there is consistent lack of empathy in society there will almost certainly be a power imbalance so permanent that it looks normal. We teach children to empathise. If a toddler snatches a toy from another child they often don’t notice the toy-loser is crying. You have to take the toy back to build in a consequence so they get it.I’ve heard men argue that they can’t be expected to know if women thought past sexual experiences had been consensual – but if you wish to put a part of your body inside someone else’s, you need to be very very sure they want that body part there.I used to think the “#MeToo’s gone too far” brigade knew exactly how we felt and that they were feigning naivety, because women have always had to be alert to men’s feelings: “Will Harvey kill my career if I say no?” I do have some sympathy for these men now. It must be difficult to learn empathy in public, in middle age. Now that they could lose their jobs, for the first time they’re genuinely asking, “When I’m here, how do you feel?” That’s a very good thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81c6b8da1fed2bb65cf18c22a8be6638c7a7e0c7/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c0092139faa30ed8489781726a68982 685w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of fizz","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘fizz’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘fizz’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what fizz means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 January at 10am.

But official figures show that many independent schools are opting for internationally recognised GCSEs (IGCSEs), which are being phased out of state schools at the behest of the government because it considers them less robust.The consequence, according to critics, is that private school pupils are being afforded an advantage over state school students in the race for university places.The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner MP, said: “We cannot have an education system with different rules for the privileged few. It is totally wrong that Tory reforms are putting state school pupils at a disadvantage compared to their counterparts who can afford a private education.“We urgently need to get to the bottom of this situation. A full, root-and-branch review of Tory reforms to qualifications and their impact on pupils is needed.”IGCSEs were approved for use in state schools in 2010 but they were removed from league tables in 2014. According to the DfE, once the first exams are held in a reformed GCSE subject, the equivalent IGCSE is removed from key stage 4 performance tables, meaning state schools cannot use them.The reformed GCSEs have faced criticism for causing increased stress and anxiety to pupils by scrapping coursework and modules and making exam performance more crucial. But Labour says that private school pupils are not being held to the same standards.Powell said: “State school pupils have been treated like guinea pigs while many independent schools have gamed the system, insulating their institutions and their pupils against these changes, keeping the easier international GCSEs completely, or waiting for the new GCSEs to bed in before opting to enter their pupils on to these courses.”Analysis by her office of the highest-performing independent schools showed that none puts their pupils in for the full suite of reformed GCSEs in EBacc subjects, which also include geography or history and a language.Pupils at Eton college, where fees are £40,668 per year, were only entered into IGCSEs in EBacc subjects. At the £37,296-per year boarding Sevenoaks school and £17,040-per year Abbey school in Reading, students were only entered for IGCSEs.Julie Robinson, general secretary of the Independent Schools Council, said schools in the private sector chose qualifications “based on the intrinsic educational quality of the course content. They have a responsibility to ensure pupils are fully prepared for their next steps in life, achieving qualifications that are well-respected and valued by universities and employers”.“More than half of exam entries in 2018 were for GCSEs, while IGCSEs – taken by millions of students around the world – accounted for the remainder. Historically, independent schools opted for IGCSEs due to their rigour and reliability compared with GCSEs, before the introduction of the recent reforms, which are still being rolled out.”IGCSEs include coursework, whereas the Association of School and College Leaders, which has expressed concerns about the impact of the reforms on pupils’ mental health and wellbeing, says year 11 students typically sit more than 30 hours of examinations in the new GCSE system. The reforms were introduced by the then education secretary Michael Gove in an attempt to make courses more demanding and in response to perceived grade inflation.The DfE has been approached for a comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/725f87324aa6e8e05b57b16bcbdc8e152485bae7/32_719_1748_1049/master/1748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16cae4a96c2bdae9b771898922bf2a70","title":"at your leisure the best activewear for 2018 in pictures","story":"New year, new you, new goals to run the marathon.

On the eve of the release of her new film, in which she plays Mary Queen of Scots, she reflects on her country’s changing social landscape and her habit of playing oddballsIn a hotel room somewhere in London, Saoirse Ronan lies on a sofa, her back rigid against one of its arms, her legs straight out in front of her. She looks a bit like a doll: one that has joints at its hips, but not at its knees. “Sorry,” she says, seemingly unable to get up as I offer her my hand. “It’s these clothes! They’re not mine, and I can’t walk in them.” In an interview she gave not so long ago, Ronan insisted that away from the film sets and the red carpets, she looks a bit like a mother of one who’s “gone mad” in Anthropologie. Her mufti comprises “a lot of knit and some pink slacks that are very comfy”. Not today, though. Today, she is straight out of the last days of disco: her high-waisted, flared jeans are tighter than tight her vertiginous velvet platforms are encrusted with coloured crystals. To get from where she is to the bottles of mineral water that are arranged on a table less than half a yard away, she could really do with wheels, or some kind of winch.The RourkeWillimon version of Mary’s life begins in 1561, when the 16-year-old queen, following the death of her husband King Francis II, arrives in Scotland from France to reclaim its throne. It takes in her struggle to rule as a Catholic in a Protestant-led country her quashing of (and, later, her failure to quash) various rebellions among her noblemen and, above all, her determination that her cousin, Elizabeth I (played with aplomb and a great deal of face powder by the Australian actor Margot Robbie), name her as her heir. Much is made of her disastrous marriage to Lord Darnley, whom Willimon depicts not only as a drunk, but as the lover of his wife’s minstrel, David Rizzio – and of Mary’s tolerance of Rizzio’s sexuality (the Scottish queen is depicted as a kind of proto-feminist whose liberal instincts are almost as devoutly felt as her Catholic faith). It also includes a scene, once Mary has been forced to abdicate and has fled south to England, in which the two queens finally meet – something that never happened in real life (Mary died in 1587 without ever having met her cousin).Ronan began acting when she was eight or nine, in a medical drama on Irish television called The Clinic. She has, then, been working as an actor for two-thirds of her young life, and it would be easy to assume that this might be one reason why she seems to have such a sense of connection with Mary Stuart, whose every move was also lived in public. But she doesn’t see it this way at all.“The experiences I was having were different from most other young people of my age,” she says, “but I wasn’t in a big Disney show where I was, like, a superstar – and I wasn’t in Harry Potter, either. I wasn’t famous. I was just a kid who was in stuff, and was very lucky to be that.”Though she was nominated for an Oscar for her role as Briony Tallis in Joe Wright’s adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel Atonement, at the age of only 13, she insists that she wasn’t known at all until 2015, when she starred as Eilis Lacey in Brooklyn (another role for which she was nominated for an Oscar). “I’ll always have that mentality of ‘no one knows who I am’ – and I like that.” Until quite recently, she still worried when she wasn’t working. Would everyone forget her? “I’ve definitely felt that in the past. But then I watched an interview with Kate Bush after she went away. No one forgets about Kate Bush. She does her thing, and then she disappears. Adele does it, too, and Daniel Day-Lewis. It’s clever, I think, and healthy.”Later, as her career built, she was home tutored. “I was away so much. But once I was in my late teens, everyone else had left school, too, and I was excited for my friends to go to college and get jobs because then it would be: great, we’re all working now.” Does she still have friends from that time? “Yes, two of my oldest are still my best mates. Christopher is my dad’s best friend’s son, and Amy is my mam’s best friend’s daughter. We all grew up together. Amy is brilliant. She would see things I was in, but she has definitely fallen asleep in two of them.” She laughs. “She only really got excited when I worked with Ryan Gosling – and then she was interested, because she loves Ryan.”She can, she says, disappear quite easily out on the streets – though less so in Ireland, where she lives by the sea close to Dublin.“A lot of people know me there. It’s a small country. That’s just the way it is. But anywhere else, yes, I can be invisible – though on the tube I do get people looking hard at their mobile phones, and really they’re surreptitiously taking a picture of me. You’re staring at them, and you’re thinking: I can see you. But some people think you only exist on the telly that you’re not a real person, and so it doesn’t matter. I would never do that myself – it would feel like you’re stealing from someone.”She’s not on social media any more, and she doesn’t read reviews.“I don’t expose myself to them. There will be something that sticks in my head, because it’s not a natural, normal thing for people you don’t know personally to write about you” – I nod my head, perhaps because our own encounter seems so bizarre, the two of us closeted in this wireless and slightly sterile hotel room, like a pair of lovers (except that right outside the door are three minders, each of them furiously tapping at their mobile phones) – and she says, almost apologetically: “Well, it can be lovely having a chat. But reviews, they’re not written for me.”This brings her to Christine McPherson, the teenager she played in Greta Gerwig’s 2017 film Lady Bird, for which she won a Golden Globe and was again nominated for an Oscar. “I was so knackered when I was doing it,” she says (she came to it straight from starring on Broadway in The Crucible). “My skin was in shit. But when you’re tired, something else comes out in you. You’re defensive and lethargic, and everything bubbles up to the surface. It freaked me out a bit, but my mam said: ‘She’s 17 and she hates everyone except her friends, and she’s a bit narky. It’s perfect.’”She’s now shooting another film with Gerwig: Little Women, in which she plays Jo. Is it any different working with a woman director? She gives me a very direct look. “Honestly? No. I just want them to be happy. They’re leading the way. It’s their vision. With any director, it feels like a pupil-teacher relationship, or a parent-child one.”She’s weary of being asked about #MeToo. She has always felt safe in her world she’s never had any trouble. She’s more interested in something I bring up: the recent comments of the Danish director, Susanne Bier, about how looks are the last taboo in Hollywood (Bier has spoken of her struggle to persuade studios to let her cast actors who do not conform to their idealised image of beauty). Ronan believes Bier is absolutely right – though this state of affairs obviously affects women far more than men.Television, she thinks, is far more advanced on this score than film. “I was watching Roseanne recently and there’s a scene with Laurie and the rest, and they’re drinking and chatting and they’re all normal-looking. What I loved, as someone who isn’t Marilyn Monroe, was to see Lena Dunham in Girls. That meant so much. What we found with Lady Bird is that, while it’s a brilliant film and everyone is so great in it, in the end the reason why it could have an effect on the industry is because it made money.”Does she feel under pressure about her own looks? “I really don’t. I suppose I was playing girls from an early age that had nothing pretty about them – they were weird or they were tomboys – and in order to do a good job I just had to go: well, fuck how I look. I never got cast for my looks anyway.”We talk for a while about how Ireland has changed (“Oh, yes!” she all but shouts when I bring it up). Before the referendum that led to the repeal of the ban on abortion, Ronan appeared in a video supporting the reproductive rights campaign. Did she think twice about speaking out? Not exactly. But these things are complicated.“When I was younger, and there were petitions to repeal the eighth, I remember thinking that even though it was the right thing, maybe I shouldn’t say anything. This was the way it had always been – and that’s being honest about it. But then you get older, and you come into your own womanhood and you realise how complicated and amazing being a woman is, and how protective you feel of your own body. The idea that anyone could have a say over that is bizarre. I’ve had friends who had to go through it – travel to Liverpool for an abortion, spend thousands of euros, put yourself in the Holiday Inn…”The new Ireland thrills her. “To know it was seen as this backward place, when it never felt like that to us. It was so disappointing. But now we match up internationally to how we see ourselves, and that feels amazing.She grins. “Is there any Irish in you?” she asks, our minds seemingly turning at precisely the same moment to Brexit. I shake my head, sadly. “Ah, don’t worry,” she says. “I’ll get you a passport.” She sounds so very sincere that when her hands go to the waistband of her jeans, still cutting her in two, I half expect her to pull one miraculously from her pocket.Mary Queen of Scots is in cinemas from 18 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f19aae255bf7bb7a9b7f2ebcb9383b248c8f3a28/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0336e8cdc502cc83108272395f517739","title":"how to get better at cooking ive become a roasting fiend","story":"Growing up with Punjabi cuisine has left Coco Khan dependent on spices for her cooking. Can she learn to cook an ‘English’?Like many British Asians, I grew up in a household full of the smells of spice, the sound of lamb sizzling and the steady beat of a knife chopping coriander and ginger. Punjabi cuisine takes the highest place in my heart. It’s a reminder of my identity and my family, where food formed a huge part of life. When I cook, often cobbling something together from whatever is lying around, I stop thinking. It’s second nature.Which is great until I receive feedback that my shepherd’s pie has a really odd masala vibe, or that I put the wrong kind of “hot” in hotpot when I added a green chilli. The truth is, I have become dependent on spice. I keep chilli flakes on my desk my spice jar collection is 30-strong. It has become a crutch – I would compare it to someone who slathers every meal with ketchup because they don’t how to create flavour any other way.What I’ve always called English food – although I suppose it’s really British-European – requires a different skill set. I don’t know how to use herbs effectively. Any sauce that involves flour strikes terror in my heart. Then there’s the mystery that is the oven, where you can’t control the heat minute by minute. (Punjabi cooking takes place nearly exclusively in pans on gas hobs, even for the bread.) And what exactly is a jus?It was only four or five years ago that I started getting into English food at all, through cooking shows such as The Great British Menu. On TV, everything looked delicious but also seemed to require spending inordinate amounts of money on dozens of ingredients. Then there was the time and skill needed. “It takes me 20 minutes just to get some clean pans together if my flatmates have been in,” I would think. “I have no chance.” Where English food was concerned I resigned myself to being an eater rather than a maker. It was like my relationship with Love Island: by the time I realised quite how excellent it was, it was too late for me to catch up.But last month it was decided that the hallowed New Year’s Day lunch – a tradition in my circle of Brits, Americans and Aussies – was to fall to me. It was time to face my culinary demons and finally add an English into my repertoire. And what could be a better foundation than a roast dinner?To guide me, I enlisted Hannah McCollum, 28, the founder of artisanal-hummus brand ChicP and a private chef. There are a few reasons. First, her sustainable, waste-not approach resonates with my own love of “make-do” cooking. She trained at the Grange, a cookery school in Somerset that had “a very eco and natural approach. You’d be cooking with produce you’d seen grow,” she says.Second, her work as a private chef has been mostly for families who hire her to cater holidays or events, so her focus on food is domestic rather than commercial. It was working for these clients that turned her on to dips: “At the end of each day I would blend whatever we had left over for the next day’s dips,” she recalls. “It became my signature.”Third, she’s about the same age as me, so hopefully she won’t be judging me for my tiny, shared kitchen, which doesn’t have a functioning grill, yet somehow has accrued 12 novelty shot glasses.Over the course of our sessions, Hannah will guide me to create an extensive roast, including crisp taters, cauliflower cheese, roasted roots, bread sauce, braised cabbage, a red wine gravy and, of course, a meaty pièce de résistance. Along the way, I hope to master time management, learn how to make sauces and get a better handle on herbs.We decide that for our roast we’re going to use game – meat from animals that have been hunted rather than farmed, such as venison, rabbit, wild duck, pheasant and pigeon. “Game should be at the top of every sustainable meat-eater’s list,” Hannah says. Hunting may seem cruel, but no more so than a lot of meat production. And it is kinder to the environment than turning wild land into farmland.We opt for pheasant, which Hannah tells me is a versatile meat that you “can do all kinds with, from pheasant bolognese to paté”. It’s quick to cook and no more expensive than organic chicken. Plus, pheasant sounds like something that would be served up for Henry VIII. What could be more impressive than that?We start by stuffing the bird with onion and rosemary, and frying it off in some butter. We will then roast it on top of some carrots that I’ve chopped but haven’t peeled. “I don’t see why you’d remove the skin,” Hannah says. “It’s quicker, healthier and avoids waste.” We won’t peel the potatoes either those we will parboil, shake around in flour, add to a baking tray with hot oil and cook in the oven. Hannah is a believer in quick, simple cooking. For our cauli cheese there’s no parboiling, just white sauce (butter, flour, milk) added straight on to the veg then whacked into the oven with a bit of cheese on top. “You can roast anything if you have time,” says Hannah when I complain about stress. “What we’re doing with the hobs is actually a bit more complex. Usually just use what you have in, add oil, season and roast. That’s it.”But for me the lightbulb moment is learning how to create flavour complexities without spice – using vinegar, mustard and raisins, for example, to bring out acidity, heat and sweetness. Special mentions must go to bread sauce, which I had never eaten before, believing it to be some kind of punishing Victorian gruel with no place in modern society (I was wrong – it is delicious), and the simple genius of finishing dishes with nutmeg.And I’m certain that making a roux – the mixture of equal parts flour and fat that forms the basis of many sauces – will be a skill for the rest of my life. The trick is to really get stuck in with your whisk, give it some welly and keep the heat low.It wasn’t even as time-consuming as I imagined: going at full speed, even as a novice, I was able to turn out a pheasant roast dinner in less than two hours. I’m not sure if this is good or bad. I had hoped that roasting would be a more social activity, where I could pop out of the kitchen every so often and relax with friends and family. Instead, I’m working flat out.Still, I haven’t stopped roasting since. I’m a roasting fiend. My fridge looks like a morgue for birds. Chickens, pigeons, partridges: their carcasses line the shelves to be picked clean by my flatmates before heading into a stock. Forget spice: my new craving is for the impressed faces of my colleagues when I mention my lunch of grouse sandwiches. It’s all still very new to me, but I am hoping it will lead to a life-long relationship. I just wish someone had warned me about the amount of washing up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3b234ecd97e565ad4f9de1dab2c583fbdc4f4da/142_230_1408_845/master/1408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f9d62b35fbf870cbc396098836cfdf8","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool mohamed salah dive claims arsenal","story":"• Arsenal players accuse Mohamed Salah over penalty incident• ‘We don’t have ers,’ says Liverpool managerJürgen Klopp proved far more defiant than Arsenal’s defence as, rather than revelling in a biggest league win over top-six peers for 16 months and Liverpool’s largest lead in this season’s title race, he rejected suggestions Mohamed Salah is a er by insisting the striker should not have to bleed to win a penalty.Liverpool’s top scorer struck from 12 yards after Sokratis Papastathopoulos twice clipped his calves but, after the half-time whistle blew, the Arsenal defender confronted Salah to accuse him of taking a tumble. Some 90 minutes before Klopp intervened to protect Salah, so did Virgil van Dijk during an altercation in the tunnel. “He went to Mo and was saying he ed,” the Dutchman said. “He was attacking him a bit but I wanted to say he didn’t e.” Nevertheless, the reigning footballer of the year risks getting the wrong kind of tag. This was the second time in four days when opponents felt Salah exaggerated contact.Rafael Benítez bemoaned what he termed a “soft penalty” after Newcastle’s Paul Dummett tugged Salah, while his Burnley counterpart, Sean Dyche, inserted himself into the argument to describe as “bizarre” the FA’s decision not to issue the forward with a retrospective ban for supposedly ing on Boxing Day.But, on a day when Tottenham’s Harry Kane was cautioned for simulation and after Dejan Lovren earned Liverpool’s third penalty of the week when he was shoved by Sead Kolasinac, Klopp was adamant neither Salah nor his teammates deserve a reputation for ing.If Salah’s character is being impugned, Xherdan Shaqiri expects Liverpool to come under a different kind of attack when they visit Manchester City on Thursday. The champions will host their putative replacements but the midfielder believes Liverpool’s position at the ision’s summit will make them a target.“If you are top of the table, everybody is coming after you and everybody wants to beat you,” the summer signing said. “They’re going to come after us and will try to win, to grab three points.” If the stakes seem bigger than that, Shaqiri denied a Liverpool victory would end City’s defence of their crown. “We don’t go there to take Man City out of the race, we go there for a game,” he said. “Everything can happen this season but it’s a long way to go.”If Salah had a typical prominence and Roberto Firmino’s first Liverpool hat-trick made him the headline act, it invited questions if Georginio Wijnaldum, arguably Liverpool’s finest performer on the day, would again be overlooked.“Under your radar,” Klopp said. “He’s an outstanding player. He combines a lot of things that you need. In a one-and-one situation, he can keep the body between the opponent and the ball, then pass the ball. I don’t know how many positions he’s played. He can play all three positions in midfield and that’s really nice.”Like Shaqiri and Andrew Robertson, Wijnaldum joined Liverpool from a relegated club. Their fortunes have been transformed in an upwardly mobile team. If Wijnaldum, with 25 appearances and 2,224 minutes on the pitch, has been the constant in a midfield furnished with expensive upgrades, other numbers are startling. Liverpool had not trailed at Anfield in the Premier League for 364 days until Ainsley Maitland-Niles scored and even then, they were behind for only three minutes. Their 2018 yielded 88 points from 37 matches, a return of 2.38 per game that is unrivalled in the club’s history. Salah completed the calendar year with 25 goals at home, Alisson with conceding the same number – five – in his Anfield career for Liverpool as on his solitary visit with Roma.“We have finished 2018 pretty well,” Van Dijk said. It ranks as an understatement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9a2daf37d006c612c4aeabef1117f707eb0959/0_51_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edeb63c0be48d6a10ab0eb8988f3a767","title":"manchester city pep guardiola liverpool","story":"• Manager says Liverpool are ‘best team in Europe’• City close gap to seven points before showdownPep Guardiola suggested Manchester City’s Premier League title defence would have been over if they had not beaten Southampton, while admitting it remains precariously balanced going into Thursday’s showdown with Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium.City won 3-1 thanks to goals from David Silva and Sergio Agüero, either side of a James Ward-Prowse own goal, to cut the gap on Liverpool to seven points and improve on a run that had seen them lose three out of four games in the league.Guardiola went on to describe Liverpool as the “best team in Europe” at the moment and among “the top four in the world.” The scene for Thursday has been set.“We are not here to send messages to Liverpool. Liverpool know what they have to do and we know what we have to do. It’s first against second next Thursday. I know the distance is big – seven points – especially because they are so solid and consistent. But it’s a game at home and hopefully the extra help from our people at the Etihad can come.”Guardiola dwelt on the small margins that are constantly at play. Despite calling the tune for much of the first half, City might have given away a penalty at 1-1 when Ward-Prowse went down under Oleksandr Zinchenko’s challenge – though an award would have been harsh. City scored almost immediately when Ward-Prowse deflected Raheem Sterling’s cross past his own goalkeeper and Agüero quickly made it 3-1.“Today we were more aggressive, clearer with the ball. Apart from 10, 15 minutes, which always happens in the Premier League, there were many things I liked. We missed a lot of chances. The game was 6-1, 7-1. You have to score. Liverpool is not going to give us this amount of chances.”Guardiola said Kevin De Bruyne had missed the game because of a “muscular problem” and he did not know whether the midfielder would be fit to face Liverpool, while he was relieved the fit-again Fernandinho had avoided injury after a dreadful 85th-minute challenge from Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, that resulted in the Southampton captain being sent off.“Definitely, definitely, it was a relief,” Guardiola said. “I know Pierre. We were together at Bayern Munich. He’s a fantastic guy. But it is what it is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb5d478444076b2803950fa0604e02b539d54870/367_669_2802_1681/master/2802.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=371dd06a5e81742c3ef4fd9659e4f04e","title":"manchester united bournemouth premier league match report","story":"Towards the end Old Trafford was the loudest in recent memory, Manchester United’s joyous fans singing the “20 times” ditty about their record number of titles.This recognised the manner of this 4-1 hammering of Bournemouth and the Ole Gunnar Solskjær honeymoon that continues with a third emphatic win of the caretaker manager’s three games in charge.There is now a definite strut and swagger to United and not even Eric Bailly’s late straight red card dented the mood of happiness in this stadium thanks to a performance decorated by the magnificent Paul Pogba and an impressive supporting cast led by Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford.For this last outing of 2018 Solskjær made four changes. Ashley Young, Eric Bailly, Ander Herrera and Anthony Martial were in, Diogo Dalot, Phil Jones, Fred and Juan Mata out.Eddie Howe’s tinkering ran to three: Diego Rico, Jordan Ibe and Joshua King replaced Simon Francis, Jefferson Lerma and Ryan Fraser.In retaining Rashford and placing Romelu Lukaku on the bench the interim manager offered a clue of how Solskjær would prefer United to attack: with the greater nimbleness the No 10 can offer over the No 9.Within three minutes Rashford started to prove the theory. After drifting to the right he removed Nathan Aké with some Fred Astaire-footwork, punched the ball in, and there was Pogba ghosting to the far post to finish and make it three strikes in two games.This was the perfect start from a perfect move straight from the Busby-Ferguson playbook: fast, direct and ending with a killer touch. Moments later Solskjær’s men authored a near-repeat. This time possession was pin-balled along the left as Martial, Herrera and Jesse Lingard swapped passes before the latter hit a swirling cross in. There, again, was Pogba, at the end of a schemer’s run-and-leap that asked a question of Asmir Begovic the visiting goalkeeper just about answered.What was on view so far was a buccaneering spirit that, frankly, has been missing since Ferguson retired in May 2013. Required, though, from this were more goals. Bournemouth had hardly attacked but remained the sole finish behind. Perhaps to iterate the point Solskjær, Mike Phelan, Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna chatted with Rashford and Pogba during a break in the action on 20 minutes What the Norwegian and his assistants offered would not have included allowing Aké to unload a free header that ricocheted off Herrera and David De Gea in a scare a little later.Pogba, though, roved everywhere and when Martial sand-wedged in the ball there was the No 6 again to test Begovic. This followed a 25-yard Pogba shot moments before that the keeper was grateful came straight at him.On 33 minutes there was nothing Begovic could do to deny the rampant Frenchman. Here was another symphonic sequence as Ashley Young pulled the ball back to Herrera, he pinged in the cross, and Pogba was present to smash home a header that was followed by his current celebration: miming twirling a lasso.By the break it was 3-1 and Solskjær, again, had injected the entertainment-factor back into United.Rashford’s second in three matches may have derived from Martial’s chipped pass from the right but in added time the Cherries had succour: defensive sloppiness allowed a David Brooks cross and this time Aké did beat De Gea.This had a stern-faced Solskjær striding off for the half-time talk and Howe having a glimmer of hope to work with for his.The second 45 minutes began with Bailly needing to clear and Luke Shaw heading weakly as Bournemouth threatened. Now, though, came some one-touch at the other end. Shaw claimed a tackle, Pogba found Martial, he found Herrera, and the Spaniard forced a corner.Next on show was impressive pressing as Lingard hassled Charlie Daniels and Rashford, following up, won a throw-in. This preceded a long passage of keep ball from the home side in which United relayed it from back to front with ease.When they next decided to pounce Bournemouth lived dangerously. Pogba slipped Rashford in and his mini-lob was repelled by the ever-busy Begovic.After Howe swapped Lys Mousset and Ryan Fraser for Brooks and Wilson off came the effervescent Rashford for Lukaku. Solskjær’s substitution was inspired: the Belgian appeared offside but will not care after beating Begovic with a neat right-footed strike.Pogba then came close to the first hat-trick of his United career: his shot was turned on to the post by Begovic.United, as Solskjær maintains, are a work in progress. But the travail is now tinged with a new-found energy and belief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69c1bb4b390667965062f0ac9bf116d12547405e/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90404b260a6932e91ec90398fba24e83","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekends action","story":"Jürgen Locadia proves his worth, Hart loses out to Heaton, Palace need reinforcements and Arsenal need a defenceAfter Ole Gunnar Solskjær rained praise down on Marcus Rashford, calling him the “catalyst” for Manchester United’s pressing game, Romelu Lukaku might wonder when he will next be given a start. Rashford scored and created Paul Pogba’s opener in the 4-1 win. Asked about Lukaku, who was a late, scoring replacement, Solskjær said: “At times he’s a good target man but if you tell him to be a target man he’ll never face the goal, today he was side on and he’s got the attributes of a top, top striker. We need to work on his fitness but I’m delighted even though he was half a yard offside – it was a good finish.” Next up is Thursday’s trip to Newcastle United as the caretaker manager seeks a fourth consecutive win from his opening four games. So far Rashford has excelled for the Norwegian so why would he drop him now for Lukaku? Jamie JacksonFew need to ask who Liverpool’s best defender is: not when many are proclaiming Virgil van Dijk the world’s finest. Pose the same question at Arsenal, however, and it is altogether harder to muster a convincing answer. A shambolic performance reflected especially badly on the supposed cornerstone. There may be mitigating circumstances for Shkodran Mustafi, rushed back from injury. There is no such excuse for Sokratis Papastathopoulos, who was abominable. Lacking pace or judgment, displaying rashness and clumsiness, it was a performance to bring back memories of Sotirios Kyrgiakos, another cumbersome Greek, at Anfield. While Papastathopoulos was a £17m recruit last summer, Saturday suggested Arsenal need to prioritise a centre-back this time as well. Richard Jolly• Match report: Liverpool 5-1 Arsenal• ‘Do we need blood?’ Klopp defends Salah over ‘e’Mauricio Pochettino has an even stronger case for Daniel Levy to back him in the January transfer window after Tottenham’s lethargic defeat to Wolves. One way of reading a listless display from Spurs is that Pochettino’s players struggle to cope with raised expectations. They played with the handbrake on against Wolves and an uncharitable assessment is that their title challenge has lasted all of four days. But while there are questions over their mentality, a consequence of their failure to sign anyone last summer is that their lack of squad depth makes it difficult to maintain the consistency required of title-winning sides. Spurs were leggy against Wolves but they were unable to rotate after a draining period. With Real Madrid and Manchester United casting covetous glances at Pochettino, it is time for Levy to give his manager funds. Jacob Steinberg• Match report: Tottenham 1-3 Wolves• Pochettino says Tottenham lost their heads against WolvesPep Guardiola described it as “one of the most incredible things I have ever seen”. No, not the heights touched by his great Barcelona team or even those of his current Manchester City side but the reaction of his 22-year-old left-back, Oleksandr Zinchenko, to the error that led to Southampton’s equaliser at St Mary’s. “He was the best player on the pitch,” Guardiola said, after City’s 3-1 win. “Do you know why? After the mistake, he never hid. That’s why I said to the guys: ‘Learn from Zinchenko today.’” Never let it be said that Guardiola is a stranger to hyperbole. At the same time, Guardiola knows a similar slip from Zinchenko or anyone else against Liverpool on Thursday is likely to prove more costly. City were eye-catching for long spells against Southampton but also lacked ruthlessness at both ends. They will have to be tighter. David HytnerArsène Wenger used to say that an overseas recruit arriving in the Premier League needed 12 months to get up to speed. He deployed that maxim with particular reference to Eduardo da Silva, who arrived in 2007, but is there any reason it should not survive today? Jürgen Locadia joined Brighton from PSV Eindhoven last January and is hardly the first player to start slowly after leaving the Dutch league. Until Boxing Day he had not scored in 10 months the player himself was frustrated and while Chris Hughton is diplomatic enough to suggest otherwise, the club were hardly enthralled by his progress either. Yet he has provided big contributions against Arsenal and Everton in successive games, looking perfectly at home, and perhaps it is a reminder that the speed at which players are judged nowadays can be highly counterproductive. Nick AmesThis was a lacklustre contest which arguably thrust the focus on what both sides lack up front. Palace’s shortcomings have been obvious all season, with their pursuit of Liverpool forward Dominic Solanke an acknowledgement reinforcements are required given they have now failed to score in seven of 10 home league games this season. Wilfried Zaha, far from a natural centre-forward, is cutting an increasingly frustrated figure. Chelsea had spoken with Juventus and Milan about Gonzalo Higuaín and with Olivier Giroud departing on crutches, the cameo offered up here by Álvaro Morata may inject some urgency into those talks. The Spaniard, who may move to San Siro in return, had pulled his snood up over his face during the first half, looking rather uninterested as well as cold, and was horribly off the pace when introduced. Dominic Fifield“There are three England goalkeepers at this club and I can only pick one of them,” Sean Dyche said when explaining his decision to drop Joe Hart and bring back Tom Heaton. “I think I’m a fairly loyal sort of guy, and Joe wasn’t playing badly, but after looking at the stats and results I decided it was up to me to do something different.” It would be unfair to blame Hart for Burnley’s stuttering form this season, just as Heaton’s return was not the only factor in securing a clean sheet against West Ham and a much-needed win. But the goalkeeping switch was evidently popular with the crowd, who ended up chanting Heaton’s name. After a longer run in the Burnley goal than anyone was expecting after joining the club in summer, it might be Hart’s turn now for a spell on the sidelines. If Dyche is as loyal as he says, the shirt is Heaton’s to lose. Paul WilsonNeil Warnock has joked before that he would like a minute’s booing rather than a minute’s silence when he passes away. The 70-year-old has rubbed opposition fans up the wrong way throughout his managerial career, almost thriving on the animosity at times, yet even his biggest critics must accept that he has worked wonders with a Cardiff team who punched above their weight to win promotion and are now threatening to do the same by surviving in the Premier League. Victor Camarasa’s terrific winner at the King Power Stadium gave the Bluebirds their first away win of the season and was reward for a gutsy display that prompted a classic Warnock response. “Our keeper didn’t have many saves, apart from the penalty,” he said. There were six other saves actually but now is not the time to let the facts get in the way of a good story. Stuart JamesWith just under half a season to go and only five points between themselves and safety, it would normally be hasty to suggest Huddersfield are doomed to relegation. But listening to David Wagner after his team’s late defeat at Fulham – their seventh in a row – it was difficult to draw another conclusion. He was beleaguered, unwilling to offer even a cursory platitude about his team’s prospects. The German’s cautious approach kept the Terriers up by the skin of their teeth last year, and the way they lined up at Craven Cottage – with two full-backs in midfield in a 4-4-1-1 formation – showed he has not changed. Yet they are well on course to score even fewer goals, with just 12 to their name so far. “We have an issue with scoring, which is no secret,” Wagner said. Is it too late to try a different approach? Paul MacInnesRafael Benítez is exaggerating when he says it will take a miracle for Newcastle United to avoid relegation this season but the Spaniard does find himself in an infuriating bind. He knows that his minimalist employer, Mike Ashley, knows that he is a good enough to keep Newcastle in the Premier League with the existing squad so every time the team do well, Ashley is vindicated and Benítez’s hopes of getting more help from the owner are dented. That is why Matt Ritchie’s excellent performance as an improvised left-wing-back against Watford on Saturday could be both a positive and negative development. Benítez wants the club to sign a specialist left-sided defender in the January window but if Ashley saw Ritchie at Watford, he may conclude there is no need.

Both Theresa May and the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn insist we must honour the result of the 2016 referendum and end our membership on 29 March. That is in just under 13 weeks’ time.But whatever they say, the only thing that really is certain in British politics is that nothing is certain at all. Few new years have approached with so much up in the air. Much will be determined by what happens on Brexit – yet no one can be at all sure how Brexit will turn out.Will it go ahead as planned, be delayed, or stopped in its tracks? With parliament deadlocked and a no-deal outcome looming into view, there is increasing talk of pushing back the date, or holding another referendum to break the impasse. The other possibility is another general election.May clung on as prime minister before Christmas despite more than a third of Tory backbenchers in her deeply ided party saying they have no confidence in her. But, if she fails to get her own Brexit deal through parliament in January and if any of the three scenarios outlined above happen, it is hard to imagine how she could survive.Labour, too, is ided on Brexit. For the first time since becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn is coming under fire within his party for refusing to oppose Britain leaving the EU and throw his weight behind a new public vote.The centre ground, meanwhile, is wide open. Increasingly there is talk of discontented Labour and Tory MPs, perhaps backed by Liberal Democrats, forming a new centrist party from the political rubble left by Brexit.One to watch: Amber Rudd.

Scientific attention may also be focused on the Arctic, where meteorologists will be watching to see if last winter’s high temperatures were a one-off or a disturbing new trend caused by a weakened polar vortex.If weather forecasters are correct, 2019 could also be another El Niño year, which means many parts of the world could also be in for another summer of heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, coral bleaching and forest fires. This will be a crucial year to determine how fast humanity can respond to the growing threat.On 23 September, the UN secretary-general António Guterres will convene a climate summit to urge government leaders to raise their emissions-cutting ambitions, followed on 11 November by the next regular conference of the climate talks, hosted by Chile. Environmental issues will increasingly shape and be shaped by politics. Buffeted by the gilet jaunes protests, the French president Emmanuel Macron has promised to put climate and bioersity high on the agenda of the G7 summit he will host in Biarritz from 25-27 August.If the fossil-fuel championing Donald Trump survives the arrests of his former aides, he is likely to push back against a new bipartisan climate bill and continue unravelling pollution controls for national parks.In China, President Xi Jinping’s promise to create an “ecological civilisation” will be tested by the massive infrastructure investment of the Belt and Road Initiative. Globally, the big question will be whether emissions can finally start to fall after two years of rapid growth. If not, expect fiercer protests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion and 350.org.One to watch: Greta Thunberg.

JW Forecasters have struggled to achieve a consensus about the prospects for 2019. The International Monetary Fund has warned that it could be a terrible year with much of the postwar financial infrastructure being torn apart.Washington’s policy initiatives threaten to jam the cogs of international trade, making companies circumspect about pushing into new markets. Uncertainty over a Brexit deal, the US-China trade tariffs stand-off – which could escalate in the coming weeks after a 90-day moratorium ends – and the battles between Brussels and Italy’s new radical right administration also threaten the old order.Since the 2008 crash, the west has relied on the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Turkey to drive growth, but each is going through political upheaval and struggling to maintain momentum.China, in particular, borrowed heavily from its own banks and the more shadowy elements of the financial sector to fund investment. After a crackdown on easy money, it’s not clear how strong the economy’s growth will be in the future. Yet the IMF, which failed to predict the last crash, stands accused of over-reacting to every morsel of poor economic news. Analysts at Oxford Economics are among many who predict 2019 as a period of steady if unspectacular growth. In this outlook, Donald Trump is more bluster than action, China gets back on track and British politicians will secure a deal or a delay for another referendum vote. The Italian government is already on the road to patching up its differences with Brussels. The worst is already in the past.One to watch: Jerome Powell, the US central bank chief. If Fed rates continue to rise in 2019, money will be sucked into the US from across the world. Developing countries will struggle to find the funds they need to grow. Markets will become more volatile and global growth will slow. If Powell eases back, it will look like he has capitulated to Trump’s bullying, and the Fed’s independence will be in question. Whatever he does, it will have huge implications. PIRobert Mueller’s FBI inquiry into Donald Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia during and after the 2016 US presidential election is expected to conclude in 2019. A key question is to what extent Trump may have lied and conspired to obstruct justice.Faced by similar accusations, Richard Nixon resigned in 1974, rather than be impeached. But Trump may try to brazen it out. Newly empowered Democrats in Congress will increase the pressure, just as the race for the 2020 election kicks off. Expect fireworks.Europe faces great uncertainty. EU parliamentary elections in May may produce further gains for far-right populist and Eurosceptic parties. Key “mainstream” leaders such as Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron begin the year in a weakened state the former has been replaced as leader of the CDU by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. If there is no Brexit deal, April in Britain could be the cruellest month.Bashar al-Assad’s vow to retake “every inch” of Syrian territory implies an all-out assault is coming on Idlib, the last hold-out province. Many Syrians in Turkey and Jordan appear poised to return home – if the war ends. But the unresolved problem of migrants travelling via north Africa will stoke tensions in Europe. The terrorist threat from Islamic State may intensify as it regroups in Iraq and the Sahel.Efforts to halt the Saudi-Iranian proxy conflict in Yemen will be a race against time. The UN says millions face famine and disease. Much may depend on what happens to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo shows signs of becoming an emergency. China will exploit the geopolitical vacuum caused by America’s distractions as trade tensions persist. Elections are due in India, Afghanistan, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Canada, Argentina and Israel.Northern Syria, Taiwan, Venezuela, Cameroon, and Israel’s borderlands are likely 2019 hotspots. Russia-Ukraine enmities will cause more trouble.One to watch: Iran is in Trump’s cross-hairs, and he could escalate confrontation in 2019 to shift attention from his domestic troubles. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing bribery and corruption allegations, and the Saudi leadership is under withering fire over Yemen and the Khashoggi affair. Both might welcome a chance to bolster their positions by settling scores with Tehran. If hardliners in Iran gain the upper hand and resume nuclear activities banned in 2015, the consequences will be unpredictable – and dangerous. STThe new year will begin in spectacular scientific style when the US probe New Horizons sweeps past the tiny world of Ultima Thule.

Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3f1131f4c7c250b27fb2ac7c09c13ffdb9e1e37/0_124_593_356/master/593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f52cdd3854a42a5afc8dd56df2a10d2c","title":"a new start lou sanders on the moment a friend called out her negativity","story":"A few home truths helped save the standup from a lifetime of miseryI was in my mid-20s and living in a house I shared with some old friends and new mice. One night, I was waffling on about something trivial, but giving it great weight. My best friend, Jules, looked at me with pity and disdain and said: “Lou, I can’t bear to be around you, you’re just so negative.”Best thing she ever said! The finality, the rawness, the reality – she saved me from my own silly self. I didn’t know it at the time, of course – too negative to see it, I suppose.Like a lot of kids, when I was really young, I was overjoyed with life. Dancing, prancing and mucking about. Shoving Lego up my bum with a smile on my face. Five-year-olds have the right idea (not so much about the Lego that’s a waste of a good toy). But young kids have life sorted. Not a lot holds them back. You want a song? They will sing it. You want someone to live in the moment? They’re on it – although they can’t tell the time.I was relentlessly positive. I was enchanted by life and very grateful. I had watched enough Blue Peter appeals to know that running water was a luxury, thank you, and I was more than happy to explain this to everyone I knew. I would jump around exclaiming: “We’re so lucky – looky here – water out of the tap! They haven’t got that in Africa.” Yes, sure, colonially patronising and geographically ignorant, but it was a different time.I would leave loving thank-you letters for my mum, brother, stepdad and cat – and the last three in that mix didn’t even particularly like me at the time – but looking back now I can sort of see why. I had the persona of a Californian orcee who has rebuilt their life and runs a course called “An attitude of gratitude with a side of sass”.But, bit by bit, life chips away at you. It happens to most people: you are told it’s not just a game, you take on responsibility, you weather knockbacks, you are told ice-cream is not a meal. You grow up and get real. Life, it turns out, is not what you thought it would be.By the time I was 25, I was a full-on neg head – and not in a funny way, either. I have friends who bemoan everything and it is hilarious: they’re great value – they are funny! The difference is they’re not looking to others to fix them, they are not sucking people’s energy. In fact, they get a twisted pleasure from deriding everything and the way they do it is paradoxically joyous, because they are having fun.But true vibe-killers, like I was – there is nothing funny about them. And they make life harder for themselves, because, to some degree, you get what you expect. This has been proved by social scientists such as Richard Wiseman and social idiots like my friend Unlucky Barry.When I was 25, it was not like I was in a war zone or a hospice. I had a colourful backstory, but lots of people had it way worse. The main thing in my way was my own goddamn attitude. So Jules’s wake-up call was a gift. It forced me to get positive. This did not happen overnight, but – bit by bit, month by month, year by year – I did it. I devoured self-improvement books, I watched Eckhart Tolle on YouTube, I observed other people and questioned how they approached life. I was committed to resetting myself to be more joyful and, as I became better at it, my life became better.Is this true, or did I just view my life more optimistically? Who cares – the result is the same. Externally, things did improve and I was more fun to be around. I know some people will roll their eyes at this – it sounds so millennial, so navel-gazing, so self-obsessed and privileged. Maybe, given the state of the world now, it seems fluffy, light, insidious and irresponsible even to see some of the suffering and say: “Smile, it’ll be all right!” But that is not what I am saying – lots of things won’t be all right and lots of things will. That’s why you have to enjoy the good bits and not wait for the bad. When the sun is shining, enjoy the sun when the rain is raining, dance in the rain – you’re going to get wet anyway. And if you slip and injure your back, at least you get some time to relax in hospital.Lou Sanders: Shame Pig is touring from 16 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fccea53f52cca9f8574a5a90b49c5719e48bdfa/0_612_3343_2006/master/3343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab4377192e13f1ce96c4c99df1d65b8","title":"a new start the best photographs to usher in 2019","story":"Tomorrow is a new year, but fresh starts don’t obey the calendar. Here, six photographers reflect on a time when life shifted on its axisThe Farc fought a guerrilla campaign in Colombia that lasted for 53 years. Almost half of the fighters were women, but they were forbidden from getting pregnant – those who did had abortions in the jungle or were forced to abandon their children. As soon as the peace deal was signed, in November 2016, Farc women began getting pregnant. I thought that symbolised the transition from war to peace. Olga, in this picture, was one of the first women to become pregnant. She had lived on the street since the age of seven and joined the Farc when she was 11. She had known only war for more than 20 years. A year after this was taken, I returned to Colombia. The camp was so different – there were lines of houses, no weapons, people were being reunited with their families. Olga had traced her brother – apparently he had been working for the military, chasing down the Farc. Now they live nearby, in peace. As told to Tim JonzeI had been napping in the back of my friend’s car when this happened. We were in Mexicali, Mexico, waiting to cross back into the US. A disturbance woke me up – I looked through the windshield and saw three men, one of whom grabbed a ladder. He held it while the other two climbed up and shimmied down the US side on a yellow nylon rope. The picture was taken on instinct – luckily, I woke up with the camera lying beside my head. I only got two or three frames before they were gone. Scaling this fence is a massive step into the unknown – from the moment their feet hit the ground, these men are entering a world of virtually enforced anonymity. It can be disheartening, filled with injustices. But, for them, it seemed worth the risk. As told to Tim JonzeBefore embarking on this project, I was in a really low place. My father had died unexpectedly, I had suffered two serious injuries and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami had devastated my country. I felt hopeless, until my late father came to me in a dream: “Go to this village hidden in deep snow where I lived a long time ago,” he whispered. I decided to take a train there. When I arrived, an ancient shrine ritual called zaido, dating from the Nara period (AD710 to AD794), was being performed. This picture shows a child drinking water from a chōzuya. Zaido is performed on the second day of the new year in order to call upon happiness for the coming 12 months. Taking the photographs represented a fresh start for my life, too. The love and dedication of the people who had preserved this sacred festival throughout its 1,300-year history, overcoming hardships such as earthquakes and war, gave me the courage to live life to the fullest again. As told to Tim JonzeI was taking photos for the annual calendar of the Italian navy, but I wanted to carry on doing reportage at the same time, focusing on immigration. I was on board a frigate for about a fortnight and it picked up 400 to 500 refugees in the Mediterranean. Some were fleeing war, including many Syrians some were from Africa. This man had arrived from Libya after crossing the Sahara, but I don’t know where he started. I never had a chance to talk to him. He was resting on the roof of the frigate under his thermal covering, along with all the other men - the women and children were inside. I want to communicate the subject in a positive way, to help make people in government more aware. As told to Phil HoadI was working in El Salvador, covering the civil war in the early 80s after the military government was overthrown. My daily routine was to get up early and drive the roads in every direction until I couldn’t any more. I wasn’t looking for anything scripted, I was just photographing the daily life around me. I was driving along a highway in the middle of the countryside one day and I saw this wedding. They welcomed me in and I stayed for a couple of hours, taking pictures. I didn’t know much about the couple and I wouldn’t be able to find them again, but this intimate scene felt like an oasis of hope among the violence. I see it as a sombre moment because of what was happening in the country, but it also represents how life moves on despite terrible crises. You never know where it will lead you. As told to Ammar KaliaI was trying to figure out what kind of photographer I wanted to be. I realised that the most personal thing about me was that I hadn’t told my parents I was gay. What if I came out to them in a photography project? The idea seemed too crazy, but it kept haunting me. I realised I had to be sensitive to my parents – I couldn’t be like: “Hi, I’m gay,” and shove a camera in their face. So, I spent three weeks photographing them from the moment they woke until they went to sleep. By the time we had this conversation, they were at ease with cameras being everywhere. After I told them, I burst into tears. Then everyone else did. My parents threw their arms around me and said: “It’s OK, we love you.” It felt like a before and after moment, not only in my personal life, but also as a photographer – the project gave me the confidence to become the artist I wanted to be.

Here,  journalists examine what a no-deal Brexit could mean for the country, sector by sector.In a no-deal scenario, the rights of British nationals in Europe to work and reside there will fall away unless a member state has contingency plans in place. For this reason many Britons have taken the precaution of becoming citizens of the countries in which they are settled.In its latest no-deal planning paper, published this month, the European commission urged member states to take a “generous” approach to protect the rights of 1 million Britons living in the bloc. It said governments should consider granting temporary residence permits to allow time for people to make applications to secure their long-term status.Campaigners say the EU’s decision to leave the issue of citizens’ rights up to inidual states means the 3.5 million EU citizens living in the UK and the 1 million Britons in Europe have been “abandoned”.Jane Golding, the chair of the campaign group British in Europe, said: “We are appalled to learn that, while aviation and financial services merit an extension of current agreements in the case of no deal, people do not. This means that there will be no soft landing for over 1.2 million British nationals living on the continent who will have to adjust to life as third-country nationals overnight once all their EU rights have been stripped from them.”Some countries have already announced advanced no-deal plans to protect British nationals. Nathalie Loiseau, France’s Europe minister, said France would guarantee the residence, employment and welfare rights of the 160,000 resident British citizens living there, provided Britain offers the same guarantees to French nationals.Theresa May has said EU citizens settled in the UK will be free to remain. However, some of their rights, including the rights of elderly parents to move to the UK to live with their children, will be diminished. It is difficult to see how ports could continue functioning as before even if the government’s no-deal plans swing seamlessly into place in March. Authorities in France have said even a two-minute delay in Calais would lead to 16-mile queues in both countries. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) recently said the government was “in denial” over no-deal preparations.Even if the UK decides not to impose checks, they will be mandatory in the other direction. Regional authorities in Hauts-de-France, which includes France’s largest passenger port, its biggest fishing port and the country’s third biggest cargo port, and Kent county council have advanced plans to try to mitigate the catastrophic impact that would have on both countries’ economies.Xavier Bertrand, the president of regional council of Hauts-de-France, said temporary border inspection posts for food controls would be in place for April and recruitment had begun for the first batch of 250 customs officials.In Dover there is no room for border inspection posts. Kent county council has warned of the chaos that could ensue, affecting the ability of schools, hospitals, morgues and waste collectors to function normally. Paul Carter, the Conservative leader of the council, has said no-deal could cause gridlock at Dover and spread chaos around the country at a cost of almost £1.75bn a week to the economy.Farmers and food producers are among the most vulnerable businesses in a no-deal scenario. First, the supply of seasonal harvest workers, mainly from eastern Europe, will dry up unless new immigration rules are brought quickly to the statute books.Second, and perhaps of bigger concern to the National Farmers’ Union, is the devastating impact on meat and food exporters. Not only will they face World Trade Organization tariffs with the potential to make their products less competitive on the continent, but EU rules mean they could face a wait of up to six months before they are certified as approved exporters to member states.The NFU says it has been told informally that although the UK is in complete regulatory alignment with the EU, if there is no deal, British producers will be subject to the same health checks that suppliers from countries such as China and the US undergo.It has been told that 6,000 meat processing plants that export to the EU will have to undergo inidual audits by British authorities. These will then be checked by EU officials and put to a standing veterinary committee for approval, a process that the NFU has calculated will take six months “at a conservative reading”.Hotels, pubs, cafes, restaurants and other venues face a double whammy from no-deal. Not only do they heavily rely on EU citizens to work in their kitchen, front-of-house, service and cleaning roles, but they will also, like the rest of the nation, face a potential increase in food prices.UK Hospitality’s chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said the £30,000 minimum salary proposed by the government would “shrink the talent pool and hit every aspect of hospitality from hotels, restaurants and bars, to the cost of people’s morning coffee”.Keeping supermarket shelves full and food prices down will be one of the biggest challenges faced by retailers in the days after a disorderly Brexit. The country’s frozen and chilled food warehouses have been maxed out by worried store chiefs stockpiling staples such as bread, pizza, butter and potatoes.In September Next’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, suggested queues and delays at UK and EU ports would be one the biggest problems faced by clothing chains if the need for increased customs declarations created a logjam. Clothing prices could also rise if another currency shock pushes up costs for retailers which import goods in dollars.“It is not yet clear how well prepared HMRC systems, customs and other relevant personnel will be for the upcoming potential increase in workload and data capture,” said Wolfson, a prominent Vote Leave supporter.Manufacturers account for a tenth of annual British output and are among the most exposed to Brexit turmoil if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Many industrial firms rely on imported parts made in Europe, and the threat of chaos at Dover is forcing them to make contingency plans. Some parts cross the Channel multiple times before being installed in cars or aircraft.Rolls-Royce, the aircraft engine maker, is stockpiling parts and moving some regulatory approvals to Germany. More than 200 UK aerospace manufacturers have applied to come under the jurisdiction of regulators in other EU countries in preparation for a possible hard Brexit.For carmakers, a major part of the UK manufacturing base, their contingency measures may need to be more drastic. BMW has talked of moving its Mini plant from outside Oxford to the Netherlands, while there is speculation that Nissan might move production from Sunderland to France. Temporary factory shutdowns across the UK, including Jaguar Land Rover in the West Midlands and Honda in Swindon, are also being mooted.If the “just in time” supply chains used by manufacturers stretch or break because of delays at ports, it will be costly. Airbus has said just a week’s delay would cost €1bn, while smaller manufacturers are scrambling to secure loans from banks for extra working capital as they stockpile.A no-deal Brexit would leave Britain’s financial services sector without a replacement for passporting rights, meaning banks would be blocked from selling their services freely across EU borders.In the UK, European firms will be able to continue operating while they apply for local licensing but there will not be a similar deal for British firms. There is no sign of that temporary relief being reciprocated for UK firms that have clients in the EU.Most UK-based banks and insurers have been planning for the worst-case scenario from the start. This has meant applying for EU licences, putting UK employees on standby for relocation to mainland Europe, and hiring a raft of new workers for new or expanded EU operations.John McFarlane, who is chairman of both Barclays and the lobby group TheCityUK, said this month: “Every single large bank is prepared to move by March if they have to.” Energy would almost certainly keep flowing across the undersea links between the UK, France and the Netherlands in the event of a no-deal Brexit. However, industry insiders have said no-deal would introduce more friction in electricity trading. The impact could be much more serious in the case of Northern Ireland as internal government documents suggest it could face blackouts while new cross-border arrangements are drawn up.Leaving without a deal would mean the UK crashes out of the EU’s flagship climate programme, the Emissions Trading System. The Treasury has said it would impose a unilateral carbon tax on electricity generators to compensate for the exit. No-deal would therefore mean some modest relief for coal and gas power station owners, because the UK plans a charge of £16 per tonne of carbon, versus the current €23 per tonne under the EU scheme.However, no-deal would pose headaches for the nuclear sector, both in terms of freedom of movement for skilled workers and the transport of nuclear materials across borders. Research into nuclear fusion, in which the UK is considered a world leader, would also be hit. Airlines have been reassured by a pledge of an immediate bare-bones deal for EU-UK flights, which would last for at least a year. The Association of British Travel Agents and the government have been keen to counter reports that holidays could be jeopardised by a no-deal Brexit. Britons will not have to pay for a €7 visa for EU trips until 2021.Eurostar has said it is working closely with government to ensure a bilateral agreement is signed allowing it to continue services after March, and is confident it will maintain its existing timetables.Hauliers have been applying to enter a lottery for clearance to operate in Europe, known as ECMT permits, which would allow a limited number of firms to keep trading abroad. EU proposals to extend the movement of goods until December 2019 have taken some pressure off, but they have not been ratified and also would not necessarily permit UK firms to operate between EU countries or to travel to countries beyond.Given the NHS’s pivotal role, its preparations for minimising the effects of a no-deal Brexit are among the most advanced, and most dramatic, of any area of national life. Mark Dayan, a policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank who has researched the subject extensively, said “a large degree of chaos” would inevitably befall the health service under no-deal.The Department of Health and Social Care’s 33 pages of guidance, sent to NHS bodies in England in December, outlines key areas that no-deal contingency planning has been focusing on. Among the key worries is inability to access medicines. Drug companies have thus been ordered to build up stockpiles of extra medications, enough to last six weeks. The department is meanwhile helping companies pay for the storage space needed. Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, said last week he had become “the largest buyer of fridges in the world”.Hancock is also chartering a plane to fly in important medical supplies that have a short shelf life, such as radioisotopes used in cancer care and gene therapies.NHS bosses fear the impact of any form of Brexit, but particularly a no-deal version, on their vital supply of staff from the EU.All told, a no-deal Brexit would add £2.3bn to the NHS’s annual running costs, Dayan has calculated. That includes a £1.75bn hike in the price of medicines. “Given all this would come immediately after another winter of financial pressure and strained bed capacity, we would expect the months around a no-deal Brexit to be among the most difficult in the 70-year history of the NHS,” he said.

I don’t understand the logic of that.”Seaborne was established two years ago and has been in negotiations about running freight ferries between Ramsgate and Ostend, but no services are currently running. Narrow berths in the port mean there are few suitable commercial vessels available.In a statement, the company said it had been working since 2017 on plans to reintroduce ferry sailings from Ramsgate from early 2019.The business has been “financed by the shareholders” during a development phase involving “locating suitable vessels, making arrangements with the ports of Ostend and Ramsgate, building the infrastructure – such as bunkering – as well as crewing the ferries once they start operating”.It added: “It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons.“This coincides with the Department for Transport’s Freight Capacity Purchase Agreement with Seaborne which is part of their preparations to increase ferry capacity in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit.”Ramsgate has not had a cross-Channel service since 2013, when operators TransEuropa collapsed.The French operator Brittany Ferries and the Danish company DFDS were also awarded government contracts to ease pressure on Dover in the event of no deal, allowing almost 4,000 more lorries a week to come and go.A Department for Transport spokesman added: “This contract was awarded in the full knowledge that Seaborne Freight is a new shipping provider, and that the extra capacity and vessels would be provided as part of its first services. As with all contracts, we carefully vetted the company’s commercial, technical and financial position in detail before making the award.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb5534585c5297b4dfa3aaefc74ef2a73c1fab0e/0_584_1825_1094/master/1825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc2f855411cf3675606a87fb60cf4035","title":"record number of britons seeking irish passports ahead of brexit","story":"The number of British citizens applying for Irish passports has doubled since vote to leave European UnionAlmost 100,000 eligible Britons sought to hang onto their EU citizenship via a passport from their nearest neighbour this year, up from 81,000 last year and 46,000 in 2015, the year before the Brexit vote led to a sharp rise in applications.Anybody born in the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland, or with an Irish parent or grandparent, is entitled to an Irish passport – a total of about 6 million British citizens.

Again each number must be used once and only once in each expression, but as well as the operators mentioned above you can now use concatenation (meaning you can join numbers up, for example, a 2 and a 0 can concatenate to 20) and exponentiation (meaning that one number can be the power of another, such as 19).(iii) How much higher can you go with just 2,0, 1 and 9? What other mathematical symbols do you need to create expressions all the way to 100?Fill the blanks in the following equation, so that it makes arithmetical sense:You are allowed to use any of the basic mathematical operations, +, –, x, ÷, and as many brackets as you like.

Instead, any final troubleshooting must be handled by the probe’s onboard software.“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” said Hal Weaver, a research professor at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland and a project scientist on the New Horizons mission. “This is another great step in the exploration of our solar system.”In 2015, New Horizons flew past Pluto and captured a stunning series of photographs of the dwarf planet’s surface. The images revealed Pluto to be a world where nitrogen mountains tower above the ground and volcanoes erupt ice into a thin hydrocarbon atmosphere.After the Pluto encounter, Alan Stern, the principal investigator on New Horizons, asked Brian May, the Queen guitarist and astrophysicist, if he would compose a track to celebrate the Ultima Thule flyby.“I did scratch my head for a while,” said May. “The name is quite hard to conjure with. But then it came to me that this is about man’s desire to reach out into the universe and explore, and see things that have never been seen before.”The New Horizons track, May’s first solo single for two decades, includes a message from Stephen Hawking and will be premiered at the New Horizons control centre at Johns Hopkins University shortly before the flyby.“It’s been very exciting. I feel like I’m on that thing,” May said. “To me, it’s about the human spirit and reaching out to discover where we are and why we are here.”In what promises to be the briefest of cosmic encounters, New Horizons will hurtle past the 20-mile-long Ultima Thule at 31,500mph and get as close as 2,200 miles. Once the probe has gathered all the information it can, it will beam images back to Earth. Even travelling at the speed of light, the data will take six hours to reach home.In recent weeks, scientists on the New Horizons team have scoured pictures from the spacecraft’s Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (Lorri) for signs of trouble ahead. At such speed, a particle the size of a grain of rice could knock out the spacecraft.“We’ve looked pretty hard for hazards and we haven’t seen anything to be concerned about, so we are sticking with our primary trajectory,” said Weaver. If the team had spotted dust rings around Ultima Thule, the spacecraft would have been nudged on to a more cautious trajectory that would have taken it further from its target.Mission controllers will not know if the flyby has gone well until engineering data from the probe is beamed back after it has passed Ultima Thule. The probe’s software should respond to most glitches, such as an instrument suddenly drawing too much current or an incoming cosmic ray upsetting the computer.Little is known about Ultima Thule, or MU69, to use its official name. But based on preliminary observations, scientists think it may resemble a giant peanut with two large lobes fused together. The dark rock may contain frozen carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, molecular nitrogen and methane, which may be exposed by impact craters on the surface.While some comets that streak through the solar system are thought to have originated in the Kuiper belt, those as distant as Ultima Thule have remained on the outer edges of the solar system since birth. For this reason, it is thought that objects such as Ultima Thule, the so-called cold classical Kuiper belt objects, look the same today as they did at the dawn of the solar system.“We’ve never explored a body as primordial or as far away from the sun as Ultima Thule,” said Mohamed Ramy El Maarry, a New Horizons science team collaborator and lecturer at Birkbeck, University of London. “This gives us a chance to look at what comets are like before they enter the inner solar system. They’ve been in deep freeze since they formed 4.6bn years ago.”He added: “What’s really exciting is we expect to see surprises. We are really looking at the basic ingredients of the solar system. This can tell us a lot about the building blocks of the solar system, about the conditions when the solar system formed, and about other solar systems as well.”The first images to be beamed home from Ultima Thule will be small and grainy, but a day or two after the encounter, Nasa hopes to have more impressive pictures from the probe. “This is the first time we’ll fly past a cold classical Kuiper belt object and really see what it looks like,” said Weaver. “We’re taking our first steps into this whole new zone of the solar system. We’re on our way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5517a4cd381c3b01a9c2fc30a7a537d4aee0d062/0_66_3911_2346/master/3911.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbd9eafee974cb98679814139fc5d23e","title":"heavyweight boxing tiger woods caster semenya russia sporting predictions 2019","story":"“It is dangerous to make predictions, especially about the future.” Some attribute that quote to Mark Twain.

Hopefully, in 12 months’ time, I will not look like an ass.Anyone betting that Tiger Woods would win anything more than his local pitch and putt 18 months ago would have been laughed out of the bookies. Now, after recovering from a fourth back surgery, all bets are on. Woods is as short as 9-4 to win a major in 2019 and, while he turned 43 on Sunday and has not won a major in just over a decade, would you dare bet against him? Especially as he has won at Augusta four times and has victories at Pebble Beach, which will stage the US Open, and Bethpage Black, which will host the US PGA. If his back holds up, watch out: his 15th major is on.If boxing followed the rules of logic or the free market, Anthony Joshua would fight Tyson Fury at Wembley in April, followed by the winner meeting Deontay Wilder in an autumn mega-fight for the unified heavyweight title. It sounds so simple – the best taking on the best at their best – yet a swamp of boxing politics and arguments over money needs to be waded through first. With Joshua most likely to face Dillian Whyte (again) next, the prospect of him taking on his two biggest rivals before 2020 looks slim.Growing up, I spent summers with a cricket bat in hand and winters listening to Test Match Special and playing Test Match – the “authentic action-packed table top cricket game, officially endorsed by the England Test team” – the game’s original Big Bash. I bet there were thousands of others like me, too. And while cricket is not nearly as loved or cherished these days, there is an obvious chance for a recalibration in 2019 given that England are favourites for a home World Cup and an Ashes series is also looming. Whatever happens, any measure of success must go beyond victories and trophies. And with no free-to-air matches on TV, how many kids will be able to distinguish Joe Root from Joe Bloggs or want to pick up a bat themselves?Providing England’s Lionesses do well – and they are ranked No 4, according to Fifa – then the Women’s World Cup should be a breakthrough moment for women’s football in England. Already there is a powerful momentum – when England reached the semi-finals in 2015 a peak audience of 2.4 million watched them lose to Japan, while their Euro 2017 semi-final against the Netherlands on Channel 4 had over four million viewers, the biggest ever British audience for a women’s football match. With the BBC holding the rights for France 2019, expect the game to take another big leap forward if England can do at least as well again.Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have won an astonishing 50 of the 60 grand slam titles between them since the start of the 2004 season, with Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka picking up another six. Yet with Federer, now 37, and Nadal and Murray struggling with injuries for much of 2018, some believe the golden generation is finally losing its lustre. I do not see it myself, at least not yet. Remember Djokovic lost only three times in the past six months (although all three came against players aged 22 and under) while Nadal is still a monster on clay. Meanwhile Serena Williams will expect finally to surpass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles in 2019 – even at 37.Despite all the twists of the past four years the Russian doping scandal will linger in 2019. For while the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was controversially reinstated by Wada in September it still had not handed over all the data stored in its Moscow laboratory by 31 December as promised and faces being suspended again. Rusada’s director general, Yury Ganus, has warned that Russia is “on the brink of the abyss” and faces having athletes banned from major events but I do not see that apocalyptic scenario playing out. The International Olympic Committee does not want Russia out in the cold, after all, so expect some goalpost-shifting or messy compromise again.The court of arbitration for sport (Cas) will finally rule on Caster Semenya’s case against athletics’ governing body, the IAAF, in March. But whatever it decides it will provoke anger – and possibly chaos. The IAAF argues that intersex athletes have a huge and unfair advantage because their bodies produce far more testosterone than other women. Semenya’s supporters point out that is hardly her fault. Either way the IOC will be watching closely – for Cas’s ruling over how much testosterone matters in sport could have ramifications not only for intersex athletes but for transgender ones, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f182d34747d16ef0adc527b259012d19cfa4cc03/98_404_1989_1193/master/1989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9847f153f8718bd9ffe7b938cdb1424","title":"the big picture christian dior 1955 favourite model lucky","story":"Fashion designer Christian Dior is pictured in this 1955 image with his favourite model ‘Lucky’ in his Paris atelierIt’s hard to believe that two years after this photograph of Christian Dior and his favourite model, Lucie Daouphars (otherwise known as Lucky), was taken in 1955 the great couturier would be dead. For the image speaks so volubly of his continuing industry: the swatches of fabric behind his desk the drawer beneath it, full to bursting with ribbons and buttons above all, the master’s intense, almost dreamy concentration as he contemplates the bolt of red silk wrapped so pleasingly around Daouphars’s tiny frame.By this point, of course, Coco Chanel, who regarded Dior’s designs as an affront to liberated women, was snapping at his heels she launched her trademark suit in 1954. But why would he have cared? His influence, then as now, could not have been overstated. In February 1947, at 30 Avenue Montaigne, Dior had unveiled what would come to be known as the New Look (a phrase coined by Carmel Snow, the editor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar). Overnight, its full skirts and nipped-in waists redefined women’s silhouettes it would go on to revitalise the Paris fashion industry. In Britain, Dior’s clients included Margot Fonteyn and Nancy Mitford the gown worn by Princess Margaret when she was photographed by Cecil Beaton to mark her 21st birthday was by Dior.In February, the V\u0026ampA will open the biggest exhibition ever staged in the UK on the house of Dior. It will trace the couturier’s influence, as well as that of the six designers who went on to succeed him at the fashion house, and it will look, too, at his love affair with Britain (he found tweeds so fetching – though it’s possible he was just being polite). Above all, it will (I hope) capture the excitement felt by war-weary women across Europe as they realised hemlines were set to drop – and drop. “My skirts are a release,” Dior insisted, and in a way, he was right. However cumbersome, they were also a sign that life, having been so hard for so long, was about to get a little better.Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams is at the V\u0026ampA, London, from 2 February-14 July 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80ca4964068bdae3ac8faf8a1523f35785fb304/178_610_5016_3010/master/5016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e3181f85ad6fb977ca8da1497eebdc3","title":"algonquin national park wild new years eve in canada","story":"At an eco-lodge in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, New Year’s Eve is celebrated around a campfire, surrounded by snow, endless forest and wolves “Hello,” I called. “Anyone there?”I was beginning to lose hope I’d ever find the Algonquin Eco-Lodge. It was as dark as a coal mine on the thickly wooded trail, the temperature around -25C. A sign about 15 minutes back said it was a 2.5km walk from the parking lot. There had been a few forks in the path and now I thought I might have taken a wrong turn. My phone had no signal – par for the course in Ontario’s Algonquin Provincial Park, thousands of square kilometres of wilderness 234km south-west of Ottawa and 18km from the nearest town. Fortunately, I was dressed for the occasion — ski pants over long underwear, thermal socks, proper winter boots, and several layers under my jacket.Another five minutes of walking and still no lights. I called out again, anxiously. Nothing. I continued on my way, talking aloud to myself as I trudged along – telling any passing wolves or bears to please stay clear. Then, up a short rise, there it was! A beacon of light in the winter darkness.Algonquin Eco-Lodge is a ramshackle cabin built in the 1970s, its rustic wood-panelled walls adorned with vintage skis and other cottage paraphernalia, and fitted with a woodburning stove, two shared bathrooms, and a micro hydro generator powered by the river. During the three days I spent here, the generator, engineered by wilderness guide and lodge owner Robin Banerjee, produced electricity, but little in the way of heat, leaving me and the 26 other guests constantly vying for spots in front of the stove and permanently attired in slippers, thick socks, big sweaters and long underwear.It was my first visit to the lodge, the only accommodation open in winter in the park, but several of the other guests were repeat customers, returning year after year to enjoy winter sports, camaraderie, and the annual New Year’s Eve celebrations.The day before New Year’s Eve, after a breakfast of pancakes, toast and fruit, everyone wrapped themselves in parkas and ski pants to head outside. Some went snowshoeing on the dedicated trails while others opted for cross-country skiing on the 60-odd kilometres of groomed pistes.I was hoping to track and photograph wildlife, so I went walking with Rick, a canoe guide and survival hunter. The irony of a vegan animal-lover tracking animals with a hunter wasn’t lost on either of us. We headed down to the “deer highway”, where a motion-activated camera records passing animals – mostly deer, and the wolves that hunt them. I felt a frisson of fear when I realised that I had walked right by here on my way in the night before. Along the way, Rick pointed out how the deeper, larger paw prints were those of a wolf while the smaller, closer together ones had been made by foxes, stoats or pine martens.Shortly before sunset we drove to the park’s Mew Lake campground. As an urban Canadian from Montreal, I was amazed to discover that there exists an entire subculture of winter campers. A festive atmosphere hung in the air as they bustled about unpacking and organising their rented yurts, playing hockey on the outdoor rink or stood wrapped up like the Michelin Man warming themselves around campfires. With the light taking on an otherworldly peachy-rose hue, I chatted with Christina, a blogger who makes her own canvas tents. “It’s not that cold,” she insisted, “when you’re inside with the stove burning.”On New Year’s Eve, I headed down to the deer highway on my own with my camera, and ran into a group of fellow lodgers guzzling wine and beer, and “warming up”, Finnish-style, in the carbon-neutral hot tub. Robin, meanwhile, was cutting a hole in the frozen pond with a chainsaw for the annual Polar Bear Dip. Only one person was deranged enough to participate. The air was like crystal, so crisp and hardened by the cold it felt as if it would shatter. Back at the lodge, after a belly-warming curry, small groups gathered in the lounge to drink beer, wine and spirits brought from home, and a thirtysomething hipster took out his antique banjo and played country tunes. Just before midnight we ventured outside, flasks at the ready, and gathered round the bonfire, mesmerised by the flames. At the stroke of midnight, Robin set off the first of the fireworks over the lake. Pinks, purples and greens flashed so loud and bright I worried the animals I’d hoped to find would drop dead from fright.On New Year’s Day, the trail seemed shorter and much less threatening than it had on the way in. But once I hit the deer highway, I heard rustlings all around then, behind me, a snort and the snapping of twigs.

But it could have, because the USP of this version is that it is not the musical that long ago usurped the novel as What We Mean When We Talk About Les Misérables. “Boo!” shouts the half of the country that also likes fancy-dress parties, board games and other terrible, terrible things. “Hurrah!” shout the rest of us.Even the refuseniks would surely have been rewarded. Starring Dominic West as a toweringly furious Jean Valjean, David Oyelowo as his remorseless nemesis Javert and Lily Collins – who pulls off the feat of making Fantine heartbreakingly naive rather than goppingly stupid – and liberally scattered with further talent (Emma Fielding, for example, was glimpsed as the infant Marius Pontmercy’s nurse), last night’s opening episode was a groaning table of treats – a rich feast with which to end the year and see us into the next. And, while I know it is not the done thing to refer to a person’s age when it is strictly speaking an irrelevance to the task at hand, could we take a moment to tip our hats to Davies who, two years after his War and Peace was broadcast, delivers this unto us, at the age of 82? If Attenborough gets kudos for voicing new nature programmes, we should be able to acknowledge this admiringly, too.The first episode covered the last year of Valjean’s 19-year sentence breaking rocks in the Toulon penal colony. There is no commutation when he saves the life of a guard crushed by a rockfall (albeit one that Valjean, creature of instinct that he is, caused when the guard enraged him). Rather, as even those of us who have never read the book or seen the musical but have absorbed the story by osmosis will know, the strength he displays in the rescue is only going to come back and bite him on his exceptionally well-muscled bum later. On his eventual release, Javert points out, with no small measure of satisfaction, that the next crime he commits, however minor, will put him back there for life. “You can never win.” Valjean may see battle lines drawn. Viewers see a net beginning to be lightly drawn around the whole.Meanwhile, the young grisette Fantine and her friends have become enmeshed with a trio of posh boys who promise them the world – gold necklaces, fine clothes, £350m extra a week for the NHS – then bugger off home when they have had enough, careless of the grief, destruction and, in the case of Fantine’s Felix, the daughter they leave behind. Her friends had tried to warn her. “The ground we walk on isn’t solid ground,” says Favourite. “Maybe it isn’t always like that,” says Fantine with the hope that will doom her. “Yes it is,” Favourite says, brutally, accurately. “It is always like that.”Valjean’s new papers mark him as an ex-convict. He is cheated of pay and is offered shelter, kindness and a chance at redemption by Monseigneur Myriel (Derek Jacobi) before the bitterness at the unfairness of his life consumes him. Valjean – as again, somehow we all know – steals the silverware instead. He is brought back, and Myriel (and coming from a Catholic family, let me tell you this is something we left-footers excel at) heaps coals of fire on his head by pretending to the gendarmes that he gave Valjean the silverware and pressing some silver candlesticks on him before he leaves again.As Fantine stares out the window of the flat that I doubt Felix has even paid for till the end of the month, holding Cosette and wondering quite what her options are as a young, penniless working-class woman on the streets of 19th-century Paris, Valjean is still struggling with his baser instincts. When a young boy passes him on the road, Valjean steals the 40-sou coin he is carrying. The boy runs off. Valjean repents. A new set of narrative engines fire up, and next week we shall be firmly in the thick of things.C’est magnifique – and there is no chance of Russell Crowe popping up to sing about stars or runaway carts. Merci, Monsieur Davies.

The American people want peace. They want results.”But Pelosi, who in 2007 became the first woman to serve as House speaker, also issued a sharp warning to the White House, stating the election was “about restoring the constitution’s checks and balances to the Trump administration”.Trump has largely avoided scrutiny under a Republican-controlled Congress, despite a litany of issues that have alarmed government and ethics watchdogs since he took office.Among the avenues Democrats plan to pursue are potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns hush money paid by the president’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen to women who alleged they had affairs with Trump and the misuse of taxpayer dollars by members of the Trump cabinet.There are also the president’s business dealings and efforts by foreign countries to influence his administration, as well as the increasingly blurred lines between Trump’s family business and the public office he now holds.“The American people have a right to know that their president is working on their behalf, not his family’s financial interests,” Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House intelligence committee, stated in a recent interview. “Right now, I don’t think any of us can have the confidence that that’s the case.”Schiff, a Democrat from California, publicly sparred with his Republican counterpart, Devin Nunes, who continued to hold close ties to the White House while overseeing the House intelligence committee’s own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.Other incoming Democratic chairmen have similarly vowed to fulfill the oversight responsibilities of Congress.Elijah Cummings, a congressman from Maryland who is expected to take over the House oversight committee, issued 64 subpoenas over the last two years. But because he was in the minority, they went nowhere absent Republican support.Now, he will have considerably more power and has said his mandate is to simply follow “what the constitution says I’m supposed to do”.Arguably the most grave responsibility could fall on the New York representative Jerrold Nadler, the incoming House judiciary committee chairman. If special counsel Robert Mueller recommends charges against Trump in the Russia investigation, any potential impeachment hearings would occur on Nadler’s watch.Earlier this month, Nadler said court filings stating that Trump directed Cohen to pay hush money – a violation of campaign finance law that amounts to a federal crime – “would be impeachable offenses”.Nadler said the alleged crimes, if true, “were committed in the service of fraudulently obtaining the office”.Bracing himself for the onslaught of investigative peril, Trump has threatened to respond to Democrats with “a warlike posture”.The already contentious climate has cast major doubts over whether there is any prospect of dealmaking.Although Trump has touted a massive infrastructure bill and an immigration compromise, he has so far demonstrated antipathy toward the legislative process.Donna Edwards, a former congresswoman from Maryland, said the most realistic strategy for Democrats would be to try to strike common ground with the Republican-led Senate and send legislation directly to the president’s desk.“He clearly doesn’t understand what happens in legislation.”Jim Manley, a longtime Democratic aide, said any semblance of cooperation “would require a radical shift in the president’s tone and tenor”.“He made it clear that if Democrats conduct oversight, he’s going to refuse to work with them,” said Manley, who served as a top aide to the former Senate majority leader Harry Reid and the late Senator Ted Kennedy.“No Democrat was cowed by that threat then, and no Democrat is going to be cowed by that threat now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33331792739bec1844c9b94f666ecdeabf367ad8/0_235_2472_1483/master/2472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7f207292011de65105f1d5dd8dfeea3","title":"trappist monks devise system to make beer without wasting water","story":"Monastery producing 10m litres a year invents plant-based recycling systemKoningshoeven abbey is one of only 12 places in the world to brew Trappist beer, and its products have won over drinkers around the world.For all the commercial success, however, a nagging sense that money has triumphed over spirituality has prompted the monks to rethink their use of water after more than 130 years.The Cistercian monastery on the Dutch-Belgian border is the first brewery in western Europe to construct a plant-based water filtration system that avoids the current waste of seven litres of water for every litre of beer produced.In a large greenhouse, 70 species, including ferns and other sub-tropical plants, sit above bins of waste water that flows through pipes from the brewery. The interaction of the micro-organisms on the plants’ roots and the bacteria in the water purifies it for reuse.“We are praying seven times a day to praise the Lord for his creation, but we were not working in the right way to stop pollution,” said Father Isaac of his brewery. “We have had to translate our faith into sustainability.”Only beer brewed with a monastery’s walls is authentically Trappist, and the Koningshoeven abbeyproduces 10m litres (18m pints) a year.It is one of just 12 abbeys producing Trappist beer. There are six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands and one each in Austria, the US, France and Italy.It is hoped that the new system, which has been officially consecrated, willpurify around 450,000 litres every seven hours when fully operational without any need for human intervention.The abbey plans to further reduce the monks’ ecological footprint in a less palatable way. “We want to be able to purify human waste water to turn it into drinking water,” said Father Isaac. “I feel a big responsibility for the next generation, and we need to ensure they inherit a cleaner world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08149f8bd89430376b717bf3a5896c2a4e603e4a/0_91_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=037306acda7562aa74627b680cc87394","title":"brazil moving its embassy to jerusalem a matter of when not if netanyahu","story":"The Israeli prime minister said Jair Bolsonaro, who takes office on Tuesday, told him the move was inevitableIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Brazil’s president-elect Jair Bolsonaro told him that it was a matter of “when, not if” he moves his country’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.The far-right Bolsonaro, who takes office on Tuesday and is hosting Netanyahu and the leaders of other countries for his inauguration, has said he would like to follow the lead of US president Donald Trump and move the embassy.But he has come under intense pressure from Brazil’s powerful agriculture sector not to do so, as it could hurt Brazilian exports to Arab nations. Despite Netanyahu’s comments, a senior official from Brazil’s incoming government told Reuters on Sunday no decision had yet been made on the issue.Such a move by Bolsonaro would be a sharp shift in Brazilian foreign policy, which has traditionally backed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Bolsonaro said he would move the embassy shortly after his election.The Arab League had told Bolsonaro that moving the embassy to Jerusalem would be a setback for relations with Arab countries, according to a letter seen by Reuters earlier in December.“Bolsonaro told me it was ‘when, not if’ he moves the embassy to Jerusalem,” Netanyahu said on Sunday during a meeting with leaders of Brazil’s Jewish community in Rio de Janeiro.“We attach enormous importance to Brazil, and Brazil in the context of Latin America,” he added. “This heralds a historic change.”Netanyahu, who met with Bolsonaro on Friday, said that the Brazilian accepted his invitation to visit Israel, a trip that is likely to take place in March.Netanyahu is the first Israeli prime minister to visit Brazil.After he met the Israeli leader, Bolsonaro said that “we need good allies, good friends, good brothers, like Benjamin Netanyahu.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85617b46740a5818c0fa3f123049a5b0daf587f5/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ec1c2868a7a3e3b3694255a07191baa","title":"from rice bunny to back up the car chinas year of censorship","story":"Online freedom has come under sustained assault from Beijing in 2018, with references to Xi Jinping’s new powers among the prohibited phrasesChina stepped up its campaign in 2018 to control what news and information its citizens can see.While censors continued heavyhanded control for any content deemed dangerous for social stability, including Peppa Pig videos and the letter “n”, regulators also deployed more sophisticated methods, going beyond Chinese social media and working harder to curate and shape what Chinese residents consume.Authorities have been forcing activists on Twitter to delete their accounts and shutting down the social media accounts of university professors. Apolitical content is coming under more scrutiny. In October, almost 10,000 social media accounts for outlets publishing entertainment and celebrity news were closed.The country’s largest internet companies have also stepped up self-censorship. The messaging platform WeChat issued a statement in November, promising to step up its policing of “politically harmful information” while in April, the boss of Jinri Toutiao, a content aggregator, issued a public apology more similar to self-criticisms in Mao Zedong’s era.WeChat groups were regularly shut down and users sending messages to friends often found themselves the victim of censorship when their messages appear not to go through.“WeChat group takedowns and news item deletions are happening with greater regularity across a shifting slate of topics,” said Rui Zhong, a programme assistant at the Kissinger Institute on China.These were some of the banned phrases this year:At the March annual meeting of China’s national legislature, lawmakers voted almost unanimously to abolish term limits for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, allowing him to stay in power indefinitely.In the leadup to the meeting and afterwards, phrases like “amend the constitution”, “I don’t agree”, “proclaiming oneself emperor” and the letter “n” were censored. “Emigration” and “Winnie the Pooh”, a reference to Xi that has been censored off and on over the years, was also blocked.In September, Chinese economist Wu Xiaoping released a controversial commentary arguing that the utility of the country’s private sector had been exhausted and such companies should now step aside.Commentators quickly criticised Wu’s proposal as “driving history backwards” to a time of a command economy. As a result, the term “back up the car” was also censored.In addition to domestic issues, Chinese regulators also tried to limit how much the US-China trade war was discussed, and censored certain types of articles and comments on US vice-president Mike Pence’s polemical speech on China, and the arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.“Censorship focus shifted from local issues to China’s global image, foreign affairs and economy,” said King-wa Fu, head of Weiboscope and WeChatscope at Hong Kong University’s School of Journalism and media studies, a project analysing Chinese censorship.In January, a woman named Luo Xixi published allegations against a professor who forced himself on her when she was a student 12 years ago. Inspired by her account and the subsequent firing of the professor, other women began posting under the hashtag #MeToo or in Chinese version, woyeshi #我也是 .When that phrase was censored, internet users began using a homonym mitu #米兔 or “rice bunny’. That too was blocked. Still the movement expanded and has led to revelations against professors, journalists, heads of NGOs, the head of a large Buddhist monastery and a well-known CCTV host.In November, officials in Quanggang in the southern Fujian province reported a spillage of C9, a crude oil that is toxic to humans, off the coast of Fujian.Local residents posted photos and accounts online of residents being sent to the hospital, arguing that the leak was more serious than officials claimed. Internet searches for “Xiamen Quangong carbon leakage” were blocked and video and posts related to the spill were deleted.Officials initially reported that only seven tonnes of the chemical were dumped into the water. At a press conference later that month authorities admitted that almost 70 tonnes had been spilled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97fcaf4b50a763c1ec14e3ea51a9431e84c1981/0_0_5794_3477/master/5794.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a74265beb8909b93c2ffea1879077e9b","title":"india worlds biggest election has suddenly become competitive","story":"PM Narenda Modi weakened after Rahul Gandhi’s Congress ends 2018 with string of regional victoriesThe world’s largest exercise in democracy looms in 2019. In the beachside towns of Kerala state, the mountain villages of the Himalayas and across the dusty cities of the Gangetic plain, an estimated 850 million people will cast their votes in India’s national election sometime between March and May. And the race just got competitive.A few months ago the prime minister, Narendra Modi, looked invincible. His party had followed its thumping national election win in 2014 with a run of victories in India’s largest states. The Congress party, which ushered India into independence 70 years ago and had been its default ruler since, was reduced to a rump, with leaders from Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) boasting the country would soon be “Congress-mukt” (Congress-free).But a few months is a long time in Indian politics. Modi enters 2019 with his aura shattered. In December, Congress roared back to life, winning three of a bundle of state elections billed as the “semi-finals” to the national contest next year. Opinion polls show Indians adore Modi. But the state elections showed they are willing to vote against his party, too.“The BJP lost a lot of ground,” says Gilles Vernier, a political scientist who teaches at Haryana state’s Ashoka University. “Its vote share decreased significantly. And its more important source of worry is that this drop was almost uniform across urban and rural areas.”India is bewilderingly complex. Parties hone drastically different campaign pitches for different states. But if any larger theme could decide Modi’s fate, it is jobs.Though India’s economy is growing faster than that of any other major country, it is not doing so quickly enough to create work for the expanding population. Each month for the next several years, an estimated 1 million Indians will turn 18. Unemployment has been ticking upwards. India’s railways ministry said it received 20 million applications for about 100,000 jobs in March.Modi says the published statistics are unreliable and do not capture the enormous proportion of the country who work for cash in the informal sector. But discontent is palpable: the Pew Research Center found Indians’ confidence in the economy had fallen by 27 percentage points in the past year, the largest drop of any country it measured.These economic missteps would matter less if Modi had not promised so much in 2014. At raucous election rallies across India, he boasted he would create 10 million jobs and unearth enough untaxed wealth to deposit 15,000,000 rupees (£16,000) in every citizen’s bank account – remarks that are likely to be repackaged as Congress election commercials and social media posts as the campaign ramps up.“The reality is that after four years there has been little change in people’s lives and state structures have shown no signs of improvement,” says Verniers. “The state’s capacity to deliver public services has not been reformed or altered in any significant way.”If the BJP grows desperate, “there may be a temptation to shift towards more polarising issues such as national security and internal threats,” he adds. That would mean a campaign of fevered warnings about protecting cows (from Muslims), saving Hindu girls (from conversion to Islam) and building a temple in the northern town of Ayodhya (on the ruins of a demolished medieval mosque).Modi is still enormously popular, especially compared with his most prominent challenger, the Congress party’s president, Rahul Gandhi. That appeal should ensure he is still prime minister this time next year. But analysts predict his victory this time will be less emphatic, and he will be reliant on coalition partners who will demand their spoils. “Last election, with the BJP winning a majority of seats by itself, was an aberration,” says Prof Katharine Adeney, from the Asia Research Institute at the University of Nottingham.Modi is the most virulent Hindu nationalist ever to occupy the prime ministership. A victory would give him five more years to reshape the very idea of India from its most influential political vantage point. But a few months out from the polls, it is clear voters will be entering booths asking a more prosaic question: “What have you done for me lately?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3744627.1546197066!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish universities grade inflation sparks claims of dumbing down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tExam boards are ‘having to put up a fight’ to avoid grades being inflated. Photograph: iStockStudents are most likely to secure first or upper-second class degrees at Dublin City University (72 per cent), followed by University College Dublin (71 per cent) and University College Cork (69 per cent).They are more difficult to come by at University of Limerick (53 per cent) and NUI Galway (63 per cent).Trinity College Dublin’s figures are more difficult to calculate as it has changed the way it categorises second-class honour degrees. Based on first- class honours, students are most likely to get a first in Trinity (20 per cent) than in any other university.The upward trend in grades has sparked accusations from some academics that colleges are under increasing pressure to award more top degrees.Brendan Guilfoyle, a lecturer and member of the Network for Irish Educational Standards, said exam boards are “having to put up a fight” to avoid grades being inflated.The HEA, however, rejected claims it has applied pressure. “Grades are really a matter for the institutions,” a spokesman said. “On the issue of quality, there is no evidence of a decline in the quality of our graduates and in fact, national employers’ surveys show strong satisfaction rates with them.”The State watchdog for quality in third-level institutions, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), said grade inflation was a symptom of a variety of factors.It said students are more focused on securing higher grades because degrees are used more widely for selection into employment or advanced studies. This has prompted changes such as greater levels of feedback for students on how to improve their performance in assessments.Meanwhile, most members of Institute of Technology Tralee’s academic council have resigned in protest at an exam board upwardly revising marks for all students in a psychology module taught by lecturer Martin O’Grady. He had failed every student in the class.There has been controversy on a number of occasions involving Mr O’Grady’s marks, though for the most part they have been upheld by external examiners.In a statement, the college said the exam board was entitled to adjust marks and this was common practice in the sector."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Applications from England, Scotland and Wales up by more than a fifth since 2017On New Year\u0026rsquos Eve, 1988, an estimated 70 illegal radio stations closed down in Ireland\u0026lsquoDev must be spinning in his grave,\u0026rsquo said British ambassador in DublinBelfast 1994 archives: Cahal Daly told NI minister an internal settlement would be \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquoState Papers 1994: US officials told Sinn F\u0026eacutein \u0026lsquolikely to increase the level of violence\u0026rsquo in NorthReport of walk in the Phoenix Park by the new ambassador and the Ulster Unionist MP Ken MaginnessNorthern Ireland 1993 papers: \u0026lsquoConsiderable suspicion\u0026rsquo in Dublin about deal, US saidBelfast 1994 archives: Gerry Adams \u0026lsquoon short leash and dispensable\u0026rsquo, said UUP MPBelfast archive 1993: Angry Orange Order demanded Northern secretary eat his wordsBelfast 1994 archives: American embassy official described meetings with NI politiciansRapidly changing industry: Independent regulator to employ up to 100 peopleLecturers at IT Tralee take industrial action over move by college to raise student marksClimate change: If temperatures keep rising, fish species including salmon will be at riskConsular services given for arrest, death, child abduction, natural disasters and terrorismAuthorities reject claims that colleges are under pressure to increase their gradesBan on unnecessary use of plastic will extend to all State agencies, hospitals and schoolsGarda\u0026iacute intercept car and recover hammer, axe and cashIncidence of invasive pneumococcal diseases in under-5s falling since 2008 vaccine introductionLatifa pictured dining with Mary Robinson following March escape attempt from Dubai"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3739550.1545405399!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how britain tried to stop gerry adams getting us visa","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin president Gerry Adams is applauded by delegates including taoiseach Albert Reynolds after addressing the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin Castle in October 1994. Photograph: Frank MillerThe Newly-declassified documents have shed new light on Britain’s failed attempts to stop the Clinton administration issuing a visa to allow Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams travel to the United States in January 1994.Adams had been invited to speak at an event hosted by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, which was described by senior Stormont official David Fell as a prestigious body associated with Henry Kissinger.Martinez felt the balance of opinion would be against issuing a visa to the Sinn Féin president. However, he was “a little nervous lest it goes the other way”.Events moved up a key when the British ambassador to Washington, Sir Robin Renwick, informed the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) on January 15th, 1994 that senator Ted Kennedy’s staff had informed him he and three other senators had written to president Bill Clinton arguing that a visa should be granted.The senators were now hearing that there was a split within the IRA and that obtaining a visa to visit the USA might help Adams win support for “his moderate position”.In response, the ambassador told the NIO he had left “Kennedy’s people in no doubt of our views”.“Adams knew that if he and the organisations he represented renounced violence and meant it, they would be welcome to join in the political process.” However, “it was wrong in principle and wrong tactically to reward Adams before he had taken that step”.Downing Street now decided that “the White House needed stiffening against political pressures to grant a visa to Adams on unacceptably soft conditions”.Prime minister John Major’s private secretary Roderic Lyne informed Renwick in Washington that he had made several attempts to contact Tony Lake, Clinton’s national security adviser. “I told Lake’s secretary on the secure telephone that private indications suggested strongly that the Provisionals had decided not to accept the joint declaration as it stood and were deliberately stringing us and the Irish government along in the hope of obtaining concessions – hence their call for ‘clarification’. I added that Sinn Féin was likely to increase the level of violence.“It would surely be embarrassing for the Americans if they let Adams in, only to find IRA violence was increasing.”On January 22nd, Lake phoned Lyne at Downing Street. Lake confirmed that a conditional visa would be granted “if Adams stated publicly that he personally renounced violence and urged all parties to the conflict to do so”, that Sinn Féin and the IRA were prepared “to participate in serious negotiations to end the conflict” and accepted the joint declaration as a basis.Lyne later informed a colleague he told Lake that Adams “would have no difficulty in putting his hand on his heart and declaring that he was a man of peace”. However, Lake replied that the administration was “under heavy domestic pressure” while he felt the British government was not winning the PR battle.In a final push to block the visa, Sir Patrick Mayhew saw the US ambassador to Britain, Ray Seitz, in London on January 25th, 1994.The Northern secretary impressed on the ambassador: “The fact was Adams had to renounce violence. Granting this favour before that would be completely wrong – in NI terms and also dangerous in terms of the USUK relationship.”Mayhew’s intervention failed and, on January 27th, 1994, the NIO learnt the US had decided to issue a 48-hour visa to allow Adams travel to New York.The US ambassador later voiced regret over the decision.In a letter to Mayhew, dated February 2nd 1994, Sir John Chilcot, head of the NIO, disclosed that the “urbane and professional” Seitz “made no attempt to conceal both his chagrin and that of the State Department that his advice had been set aside and, more substantially, at the risk the president’s decision incurred”.Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"\u0026lsquoDev must be

Photograph: Eric LukeThe head of the Catholic Church in Ireland Cardinal Cahal Daly expressed concern to UK officials a quarter of a century ago that Gerry Adams had become perceived as “the voice of nationalism”.“This was very far from the truth,” the cardinal said in confidential talks with the Northern Ireland Office on the eve of the IRA ceasefire in 1994, according to newly declassified records.Daly also told then Northern Ireland minister of state, Michael Ancram, that an internal settlement for the North would be “unacceptable”. He said “the Irish dimension was all important . . . and was needed to acknowledge parity in the eyes of those who sought it. Daly also felt that “a Bill of Rights with a strong Irish dimension was essential”.A briefing paper in the files released in Belfast this week profiles the Co Antrim-born primate, who died in 2009. It was suggested that he had had an important role in drafting Pope John Paul II’s speeches during his Irish visit in 1979.The cardinal, the memo noted, “speaks frequently and strongly against IRA violence and had referred to the IRA as a movement ‘alien to Irish traditions and Irish values’.”He was described as “a kindly man” but he had a strong commitment to traditional Catholic values, which had led him to oppose integrated education.On June 1st 1994, Daly met Ancram in Armagh. Daly opened the discussion by saying how pleased he was with the British government’s response to Sinn Féin’s demands for “clarification” of the Downing Street Declaration of December 1993.In Daly’s view, the response “left Sinn FéinIRA without any possible reason (not that there ever was one) to persist with a campaign of violence”. The cardinal said great credit was due to the Ulster Unionist leader Jim Molyneaux in keeping his party together in face of “the tactics deployed by Dr Paisley”. Daly “he was most vexed that Gerry Adams was seen by many as the voice of nationalism – this was very far from the truth”, the memo continued.On the issue of “parity of esteem”, Ancram sought the cardinal’s view as to what this meant. The cardinal stressed that cross-border institutions would have “considerable symbolic importance” for nationalists. Small gestures such as British ministers attending the 1993 GAA final in Dublin had been greatly appreciated by Northern nationalists. The nationalist community also regarded the British government’s Irish language policy as important since Irish “was regarded as a badge of identity by nationalists”.Other files show Cahal Daly expressed concern about a British government decision in 1990 to withdraw funding from the Irish language organisation, Glór na nGael.In a letter in September 1990, Daly wrote: “My regret is that the withdrawal of funding from this group has provided Sinn Féin ... with a propaganda opportunity at a time when their credibility was at a low ebb ...”The bishop had ascertained from local priests that Glór na nGael in west Belfast had taken steps “to purge itself of members or influences ... with Sinn Féin or paramilitary associations”. The organisation, he added, had been founded by Cumann na Sagart, a highly respected organisation of Irish-speaking priests.Daly was joined by the Irish government, various public figures and Protestant devotees of the Irish language in Northern Ireland in protesting against the funding withdrawal.The files reflect a change in the attitude of the British government to Glór na nGael by 1994 as the peace process beckoned. When the organisation’s chair applied for funding for a project officer in July 1994, the official advice was that the organisation should be treated as any other applicant for funding.Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3744541.1546189544!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il and sdlp people feel now is the time to move on merger","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMicheál Martin:  he has  tried to calm nerves without giving too much awaySerious talk of some form of all-Ireland relationship between the two parties goes back to 2007 and the time of then taoiseach Bertie Ahern and former SDLP leader Mark Durkan, but the economic crash – and subsequent crash of Fianna Fáil – put everything on hold.Now the political romance is back on. An announcement was expected from the respective Fianna Fáil and SDLP leaders Micheál Martin and Colum Eastwood before Christmas, but because of the Brexit issue it was decided to postpone any declaration until the new year.Senior Fianna Fáil and SDLP sources were clear in the run-up to Christmas that there would be an important announcement very early in 2019, and those same sources appeared equally clear that indeed there will be a liaison between the parties. Some will see it as a dangerous one, but more of that later.“It will be a process, and it will be very significant – it will be a new departure,” said one senior source.The parties are primed to make an ambitious announcement, although there is still quite a bit of stage-fright about the project. Generally, though, from speaking to Fianna Fáil and SDLP people, the feeling is that now is the time to strike.“If you are going to do this you need to do it now, or you need to stop doing it because this just can’t go on,” said a well-placed Fianna Fáil figure.He was confident that, in particular, Martin would keep his nerve and push ahead with the project early in 2019, most likely around mid-January. Support for the move was backed by polling and research in Northern Ireland, he added.Sources said the merger would happen on a phased basis, first with the party devising agreed policies, then developing plans to contest future elections, and finally ending up as “one all-island party which will be called Fianna Fáil”.Losing the SDLP name will rankle with many members of the party of John Hume and Seamus Mallon. This may explain why prior to Christmas, according to sources, there was still no agreed timescale on when this would happen.SDLP sources emphasised that key to the alignment was “maintaining the legacy of the SDLP”. One proposal was that when the final alliance is completed the SDLP name would be incorporated in the Fianna Fail title.The sources expected there would be a series of announcements about the merger in the next eight weeks, culminating in fanfare for the amalgamation at the Fianna Fáil ardfheis in Dublin in February. They said the only possible block to that would be if Brexit totally dominates the news agenda.The negotiations have been led for Fianna Fáil by Martin, his party general secretary Sean Dorgan and Donegal TD Charlie McConalogue, and for the SDLP Eastwood and deputy leader Nichola Mallon. The chief negotiators have kept discussions “very tight”, to such an extent that there has been relatively little leakage.An example of that secrecy was how in October Fianna Fáil Galway West TD Eamon Ó Cuív and Senator Mark Daly were involved in an attempt in Omagh, Co Tyrone, to launch independent councillor Sorcha McAnespy as the Fianna Fail candidate in next May’s local government elections in Northern Ireland.Senior people in Fianna Fáil and the SDLP were furious at what was viewed as a pre-emptive and unsanctioned move, particularly as it happened during a sensitive stage of negotiations. “It was cack-handed, it showed how little they knew about what was going on,” said an SDLP source.Ó Cuív and Daly were sacked from senior frontbench posts as a result.On a visit to Belfast in November, Martin tried to calm nerves without giving too much away. “What happened in Omagh was wrong. I have been very clear on that, I have taken action. No one can self-declare as a candidate.”And he outlined how the Fianna Fáil-SDLP talks were at an advanced stage.“There has been a series of meetings, an exchange of documents. This is a very significant issue in itself and demands substantial consideration,” he said. Engagement was “steady and substantive”.The terms of the proposed tie-up are not yet fully nailed down, according to well-placed sources. But, they said, it would involve an evolving process where there would be agreement on policy first and a closer relationship developing on a phased basis thereafter.The first electoral challenge north of the Border is the May local elections. Negotiators were seeking to determine whether Fianna Fáil and the SDLP could stand candidates on a shared platform but prior to Christmas the view seemed to be that May would be too early and that instead SDLP candidates might stand with the “endorsement” of Fianna Fáil. That was still work in progress, the sources said.There are risks for both parties as well as opportunities. For instance, as one senior SDLP opponent of the link-up outlined, were candidates from the Fianna Fáil-SDLP stable to perform poorly against Sinn Féin in the North’s council elections, it could have a knock-on demoralising impact on Fianna Fail as it prepares for its contest against Sinn Féin and the other parties in the next general election in the Republic.In the 2014 local elections the SDLP won 66 seats compared to Sinn Féin’s 105, and equally were that representation to increase and Sinn Féin’s to drop then it could prove a boost for Fianna Fáil as Martin and Mary Lou McDonald prepare to shape up to each other.Linking up with Fianna Fáil causes difficulty for some in the SDLP who remember how Hume was keen to have an open relationship with all the main parties south of the Border. Also, some in the party see the SDLP as more in the tradition of the Labour Party in the Republic.One with serious reservations is South Belfast Assembly member Claire Hanna, viewed as a potential future leader of the SDLP.“I think a link with Fianna Fáil or any one southern party inevitably limits our appeal it limits our influence in southern politics,” she said. “Part of Hume’s genius was that he developed strong relationships with all the parties of democratic Irish nationalism and with social democratic parties across Europe.”Hanna also is conscious that over the decades the SDLP was able to garner second and indeed some first preference votes from people not of the nationalist persuasion – votes that can be crucial in winning difficult seats. Some of those people would have been unionists who would have given the SDLP a vote to reflect their, perhaps, antipathy to a hardline DUP candidate or to try to keep a Sinn Féin candidate out. Hanna now wonders where would those votes go if there were a Fianna Fáil-SDLP union.“The strength of the SDLP brand is that it can attract votes from across the community, including the growing number of people who don’t want to define around the constitutional question.”Despite Hanna’s concerns it does seem, as one senior party source said, that “among the parliamentary team and the councillors there is overwhelming support” for sealing the deal.Some SDLP members concede that some of that support has a negative basis: that the party is broke that, to quote one figure, “it is a question of Hobson’s Choice” that such are the ill fortunes of the SDLP that “it has nowhere else to go”.The figures prove those points have merit: in the post-Belfast Agreement 1998 Assembly elections the SDLP won 178,000 votes compared to 143,000 for Sinn Féin. In the same elections last year Sinn Féin had 224,000 votes compared to the 96,000 mustered by the SDLP. Now Sinn Féin has more than double the number of seats of the SDLP – 27 seats to 12 – and to add insult to injury it has no seats in Westminster.One of the arguments against the deal from people in Hanna’s camp is that if the SDLP could get its organisational act together it could put up a better challenge to Sinn Féin for the nationalist vote.Yet others acknowledge for the past 20 years the SDLP never has been able to match Sinn Féin organisationally. That is evident in how election after election Sinn Féin candidates knock on doors accompanied by armies of canvassers while SDLP candidates generally operate in small units.Supporters of the alliance say that Fianna Fáil will help bring structure and finance in order to improve the SDLP organisation.Armagh All-Ireland football medallist Justin McNulty also said there was “overwhelming support” for the tie-up. “The message I am getting on the ground is ‘when are you going to do it, get on with it, hurry up’,” said the Newry and Armagh Assembly member.He too has been kept away from the detail of this prospective partnership but nonetheless said he was “trusting the leadership to come to an arrangement that does protect the legacy of the SDLP, and meets the challenges of today”.He said an all-island relationship with Fianna Fáil would allow a sharp distinction to be drawn with Sinn Féin. Ultimately he would like a Border poll but not now, as Sinn Féin is demanding “The idea of a Border poll now would lead to chaos on top of the chaos of the Brexit bonkers. We are off the cliff edge, and we need a safe pair of hands.”He portrayed the SDLP and Fianna Fáil as presenting a more acceptable and moderate form of nationalism that would put it up to Sinn Féin on both sides of the border. Both parties would “respect the British identity on this island”, he said.“The SDLP is not a party of banners and propaganda politics who are only interested in delivering an increased vote for the party. We are interested in doing the right thing,” added McNulty.A similar argument was put by a leading Fianna Fáil enthusiast for the project, who said the linked-up party would be “inclusive” and not one that “rubs its republicanism in your face” or “uses the Irish language for political purposes”.“I don’t imagine a lot of unionists will be voting for Fianna Fáil, but there are people in the middle ground in the North who do not think about constitutional issues every day, who want someone who will seriously talk about bread and butter matters rather than protesting about them.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3744726.1546213630!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il and sdlp poised to announce phased integration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin (left) and his SDLP counterpart Colum Eastwood have been keeping the detail on a party merger secret from most of their own party members. File photographs: The Reuters Ultimately the alignment will result in “one all-island party which will be called Fianna Fáil”, said one well-placed Fianna Fáil source.The final stage of negotiations is still under way, but a “significant” announcement is expected to happen early in 2019, possibly as early as next month, said sources from Fianna Fáil and the SDLP.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and his SDLP counterpart Colum Eastwood have been keeping the detail secret from most of their own party members. Others central to the negotiations are Fianna Fáil Donegal TD Charlie McConalogue and party general secretary Sean Dorgan, and for the SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon.The parties, said one source, are expected to engage in a “narrative” of announcements, with details released on an incremental basis leading up to the Fianna Fáil ardfheis in Dublin on February 23rd, where Mr Eastwood and Ms Mallon “would get a big show”.Sources said the plan also was to portray the new alignment as being “bigger than simply the SDLP and Fianna Fáil”. It was hoped to “unveil new faces from business, culture, the arts, agriculture, and from other parts of civic society” as members of the new grouping, some of whom would be future candidates in the North.The first stage of the union is likely to be the parties setting up joint procedures to agree all-island policies, said the sources.It is yet to be decided how the two parties will approach the first electoral test in Northern Ireland, the local elections in May.One well-placed figure said it might be too early for candidates to run on a joint platform, and it might be a case of “SDLP candidates standing with the endorsement of Fianna Fail” although that issue is not yet fully resolved.He said both parties were aware of the risks, particularly should the SDLP perform poorly against Sinn Féin in May, which would be viewed as a boost for Sinn Féin in advance of the next general election in the Republic.Sources said there was “overwhelming” backing within the SDLP parliamentary party for the merger, and that the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party equally was in favour. The sources said that an important part of the negotiations was devising an alliance that “maintained the legacy of the SDLP”.A senior Fianna Fáil figure said that ultimately the two parties would merge under the Fianna Fáil standard. “The timescale for full integration is still being worked on there is no clear timeline for that yet,” he added.There has been a steady decline in the fortunes of the SDLP over the past 20 years. In the Assembly elections after the 1998 Belfast Agreement the SDLP won 24 seats compared to Sinn Féin’s 18.In last year’s Assembly elections Sinn Féin won 27 seats, while the SDLP won 12.In 1998 the SDLP had three MP, while Sinn Féin had two. Now Sinn Féin has seven MPs and the SDLP has none."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3744598.1546194178!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"reform of gambling laws to include big beast regulator","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChanges to the 1956 gambling Act will include the burgeoning area of online gaming. Long-promised laws to regulate the gambling sector in Ireland will include a “big beast” independent regulator employing up to 100 people.The Minister of State with responsibility for the gambling industry, David Stanton, has admitted he is “frustrated” at the protracted delay in publishing the legislation, which is now running almost five years behind schedule.However, Mr Stanton has defended the delay on the basis that there have been enormous changes in the industry – especially with the rise of online betting, much of it being offered by companies located offshore.He said the stand-alone regulator’s office, when established, would deal with gambling addiction, advertising, sponsorship, underage gambling, promotions, and the myriad of online offerings including “games”, “virtual betting” and continuous betting.The multibillion-euro betting, gaming, and gambling industries in Ireland are regulated by arcane laws, principally the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, and the Betting Act of 1931, both which the Government has admitted are out of date.Mr Stanton said he plans to amend the 1956 Act, which deals mainly with gaming machines in amusement arcades, to include the burgeoning area of online gaming.That will be followed with the draft of the comprehensive Gambling Control Bill followed by the full Bill. Mr Stanton said he expects both to be published during 2019. On this time scale, it will be 2020 at the earliest before it progresses through the Oireachtas and is enacted.Mr Stanton said there were real concerns that needed to be addressed. “With internet gambling you could lose your house overnight online. This is the area we need to regulate, as well as the advertising and glamorising of gambling.Mr Stanton said he was concerned children were being ‘groomed’ by online games which are a precursor to gambling sites. He said the new laws would prohibit activities that encouraged children into gambling.While not directly related, he said that “loot boxes” where money is requested to acquire a new “skill” or “defence” in an internet game had given rise to concern. “Is that gambling or not gambling?” he asked."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Police say 17 killed in clashes across the country during votingThousands stranded at ports, airports and bus terminals as inter-island trips cancelledAustralian government\u0026rsquos women problem goes from bad to \u0026lsquog\u0026rsquoday mate\u0026rsquoProsecutors claim sentence too light amid ongoing tensions over Huawei executiveTsunami triggered by explosion at Anak Krakatau killed more than 400 peopleNeil Prakash (27) is a threat to Asia-Pacific region, says governmentDespite warmer US-Korean links, Pyongyang is stalling on denuclearisationInteractive game \u0026lsquoA Gay\u0026rsquos Life\u0026rsquo is a sign of progress but challenges remain for the communityFlights ordered to steer clear days after triggering of tsunami that killed at least 430Fire, danger, health and air quality warnings have been issued across the countryJapanese prime minister Shinzo Abe describes demographics as a national crisisMoves follows decision to withdraw from International Whaling CommissionAnak Krakatu volcano continues to spew ash as search and rescue efforts continueDoubts over whether whaling can be economically viable given low demand for meatAuthorities tell residents to stay 500 metres from coast amid concerns over high wavesPresident vows to have all tsunami-detection equipment replaced or repairedMore than 1,400 people injured as about 12,000 forced to move to higher groundNawaz Sharif fined $25m on corruption charges he says were politically motivatedEngineers to enter Opal Tower complex to examine if building in danger of collapseCoastal residents reported not seeing or feeling any warning signs before 3m waves hit"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3744405.1546155479!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit juncker tells uk to get your act together","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker attends a news conference earlier this month in Brussels. File photograph: ReutersJean-Claude Juncker has called on the United Kingdom to “get your act together” over Brexit, branding some Britons “entirely unreasonable” for expecting Brussels to put forward a solution.The European Commission president also rejected claims of a plot to keep the UK in the EU “by all possible means” and revealed he fears the majority of MPs “deeply distrust” both the EU and Theresa May. Mr Juncker’s comments to German newspaper Welt am Sonntag were published as British cabinet Brexiteer Liam Fox said the chances of Britain leaving the European Union will be little more than “50-50” if UK prime minister Theresa May’s deal is rejected by Parliament.Mr Fox, the international trade secretary, warned fellow MPs that failure to pass Mrs May’s deal would be “incendiary” and said it was “a matter of honour” for them to support her.MPs are due to vote on the withdrawal agreement in the week of January 7th after Mrs May, facing the prospect of a significant defeat, pulled the original date of December 11th.However the bid to buy more time to secure key concessions on the Irish backstop, the key flashpoint for DUP and Brexiteer detractors of the deal, appeared to falter when her fellow leaders refused to change the legal text of the agreement.The PM said talks would continue, although the EU has repeatedly warned negotiations over the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.Should MPs reject it when they vote in the coming weeks, it could raise the prospect of no-deal and with it the risk of heavy economic consequences for the UK and EU, or a second referendum on Brexit.Mr Juncker said: “It is not us who are leaving the United Kingdom — it is the United Kingdom that is leaving the European Union.“I find it entirely unreasonable for parts of the British public to believe that it is for the EU alone to propose a solution for all future British problems.“My appeal is this: get your act together and then tell us what it is you want. Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”Mr Juncker said it was up to the British to decide if the final decision is put back to the people in a second referendum.However, he said he was “working on the assumption that (the UK) will leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided”.“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May,” Mr Juncker added.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.”Mr Fox told the Sunday Times that Brexit will only be “100 per cent certain” if the House of Commons backs the prime minister’s deal in a crunch vote next month.Having given the public the right to decide on EU membership in a referendum, “parliament cannot now, with any honour, renege on that result”, he said. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity.

Bird Box doesn’t take us anywhere we haven’t already been in these other movies.\u0026nbsp“The plotting is sometimes very cumbersome. As the protagonists stumble through forests using fishing line to guide them, you begin to wish they would take off their blindfolds and simply look where they are going. The screenplay never really explains why the evil force (whatever it might be) causes some of those who stare at it to kill themselves while turning others into homicidal psychotics.” also gave the film two stars, criticising it for “clunky punchlines” and its slow-moving pace, along with a cast that feels “as curated as a box of doughnuts”.\u0026nbsp“Heisserer’s script endeavours to give Bullock a rich psychological backstory — something to do with her reluctance to accept motherhood and the redemption she experiences in accepting that role — and the wonderfully self-reliant actress plays the arc earnestly enough,” Variety said. “But there’s no getting around that this is a monster movie without a monster.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Due to the different paths the story can take, the film can last between 40 to 90 minutes.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch, review – Intriguing but imperfect How Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is an experiment on usWhat happened when we watched the Black Mirror film, BandersnatchIf you don’t have the time (or patience) to watch the film multiple times, however, you can pick the option that appears as the credits begin to roll, to loop back to a crucial moment in the story and change your choices, to see if they cause a different ending.This means that you can see most of the possible variants without having to start from the very beginning.\u0026nbspThese are the endings fans have discovered so far:1) The very quick one,\u0026nbspwhere the user accepts an offer to join Thakur\u0027s team and develop his video game in the office, instead of refusing. Bandersnatch\u0026nbspthen flashes to an ending in which a rushed version of his game gets zero stars from a critic, as Stefan decides to “try again” — inviting the viewer to go back and make him develop the game on his own.\u0026nbsp2) In another, Stefan\u0027s widower father comes into his room after weeks of Stefan working alone on the game. You can either force Stefan to shout at his dad or make him throw\u0026nbsphis tea\u0026nbspover his computer. Destroying Stefan’s computer ends the story. In a similar moment, when Stefan becomes frustrated with the game\u0027s progress you can either make him destroy his computer or bang his fist on the desk. Destroying the computer ends the game, again.3) The balcony ending happens when Stefan is taken to see Dr Haynes by his father, where he spots Colin walking down the street. If Stefan follows Colin instead of attending therapy, the pair embark on a night of drugs and philosophy, which then leads to a moment where Colin claims it doesn\u0027t matter if one of them jumps from his balcony.\u0026nbspThe viewer is told to either force Stefan to jump,\u0026nbspor make him tell Colin to do it. The former choice ends the story with Stefan’s suicide, and his game is finished “abruptly” without him, to negative reviews.4) Bandersnatch pushes the story forward so that Stefan has to visit Dr Haynes for a session and get a prescription for pills. If you do choose to make Stefan see Dr\u0026nbspHaynes instead of following Colin, she’ll give him the pills and you’ll have to decide whether he should flush them or take them.\u0026nbspOnce you make Stefan take his medication, the story jumps to Christmas, where Stefan has been taking his pills for months. His game is released, but the critic only gives it two-and-a-half stars and criticises it for feeling as though it were made on\u0026nbsp“autopilot”.5) In\u0026nbspthe most meta ending of the film, Stefan demands to know the truth: Who is controlling him? If you decide to tell him that his life is actually\u0026nbspentertainment on “a streaming platform from the early 21st century” (Netflix), he returns to\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspHaynes’s office to tell her about it.\u0026nbspThe doctor points out that if Stefan’s story was true, surely this scenario of him at a therapist\u0027s office would be too boring for such an advanced form of entertainment. Things then take a bizarre turn as she leaps out of her chair and challenges him to a brawl, complete with swords.\u0026nbspYou have to decide whether Stefan should fight her or flee by jumping through a window, and if you choose the latter, the fourth wall breaks completely, revealing Stefan is\u0026nbspactually an actor standing on the Black Mirror set. A\u0026nbspdirector then storms over to tell him that he’s “not scripted to jump out, it’s the fight scene now.. The story ends after the actor asserts that his real name is Stefan, marking his final break with reality, and the production team calls a medic.6) There are several endings where\u0026nbspStefan goes to prison\u0026nbspfor murdering his father. (Depending on the route, he also ends\u0026nbspup killing Thakur, Colin, or Colin’s wife, Kitty) In all these versions of the story, you\u0027re essentially forced to make Stefan kill his father if you didn’t choose to already.\u0026nbspThen you have to decide between burying or chopping up his body. All the ways of burying the body lead to Stefan in jail and Bandersnatch getting trashed by the critic, if it gets released at all.7) Arguably the most sinister ending is when you make Stefan chop up his dead father\u0027s body, and he finally gets time to finish the game,\u0026nbspwhich gets five stars from the critic when it’s released — although the game is\u0026nbsppulled from sale after Stefan gets caught and sent to jail. From there, Bandersnatch flashes forward to the present day, where Colin\u0027s daughter Pearl is shown to be working on an archive version of the game for a new generation. When she encounters the\u0026nbspsame bugs that Stefan did, the old question returns: should she throw tea\u0026nbspher computer, or destroy it?8) A few people worked out that “TOY” is the password that Stefan needs to recover his favourite stuffed bunny from his father’s safe, he then travels back to that moment in his past and places it under his childhood bed. His mother still misses her train while the young Stefan looks for his toy, but this time\u0026nbspthe viewer is given more than one choice when she asks if he wants to go with her. If Stefan says “yes,” he dies in the train crash with his mum, after which the teenage Stefan is shown suddenly dying in his therapist\u0027s office.One fan went the extra mile and made a graph of all the alternatives in the same style as the game map itself:Reviews for the new film have been mixed, but mostly positive.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsppraised it for being “innovative” with the interactive elements, adding:\u0026nbsp”What saves the film from pure gimmickry is the way in which its mechanism is bound up with the plot.Created with Sketch.Every Black Mirror episode ranked – from worst to best Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through for our ranking of every Black Mirror episode to date620 Hated in the NationBandersnatch, “Hated in the Nation” is Brooker’s answer to Scandi Noir dramas such as The Killing.

And yet the tender San Junipero, which sees two women fall in love in a seaside town that naturally isn’t quite what it seems, is a rare instance of optimism from Brooker’s generally fatalistic imagination, and we can’t help but love it for that.

It was the first to put Brooker\u0027s spin on disturbed technological advancements to truly devastating effect, tracking the dissolution of a marriage (of Toby Kebbell and Jodie Whittaker) in a world where memories can be re-lived as easily as switching on a television.

But its murder mystery plot, involving killer drone insects, fails to reach the heights it aspires to.The Good Place creator Michael Schur. The result is expansive, expensive-looking – and strangely soulless. The world it presents, however, is scarily plausible: people must rate each other from one to five at every single interaction in a bid to improve social standing. Black Mirror blueprint perfectly.1120 Shut Up and DanceBlack Mirror has one episode that yanks at the heartstrings, and “Fifteen Million Merits” was its first. The love story of a man (Daniel Kaluuya) and a woman (Jessica Brown Findlay) doomed to generate power on stationary bicycles for an unspecified amount of time, it presents a bleak outlook for the future of game shows. Brooker at his most Orwellian.Black Mirror\u0027s most intense viewing experience.

Using the DNA of his colleagues to create virtual avatars who believe themselves to be real, Jesse Plemons’s character makes for the entire series’s creepiest villain – partly because of how sorry for him you feel at the beginning of the episode, before clocking his sadistic ways.Black Mirror episode. And yet the tender San Junipero, which sees two women fall in love in a seaside town that naturally isn’t quite what it seems, is a rare instance of optimism from Brooker’s generally fatalistic imagination, and we can’t help but love it for that. By the time Belinda Carlisle\u0027s Heave Is a Place on Earth plays over the end credits, you\u0027ll be doing something no other episode can make you do: smiling.2020 The Entire History of YouBlack Mirror episodes, and for good reason. It was the first to put Brooker\u0027s spin on disturbed technological advancements to truly devastating effect, tracking the dissolution of a marriage (of Toby Kebbell and Jodie Whittaker) in a world where memories can be re-lived as easily as switching on a television.

Andy Martin reportsClick to followThe IndependentZia and his Velocity co-founder Alex MacdonaldI was wearing my Kenzo patchwork jacket, my Billabong denim shirt, and a sort of Gareth Southgate waistcoat. And I had slapped on David Beckham\u0026nbspHomme quite liberally. I was taking notes with my Montblanc pen, trying to blend in with supermodels, Premiership footballers\u0026nbspand hedge fund manager types\u0026nbspat a snazzy restaurant in the upmarket Tribeca neighbourhood of Manhattan. Because I was having a power breakfast with Zia Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of Velocity. And if you’re worrying about how much it costs to join, then it’s probably not for you. “And your membership name is?” said the exceptionally charming hostess at the door. For a brief while, I was living the dream. Even the smashed avocado on toast seemed like the best smashed avocado I’d ever tasted. Likewise the coffee. And the cutlery and the napkins were outstanding too. “My mum told me not to buy nice things,” Yusuf says, “because you always lose them.” Velocity doesn’t do things, it does experiences. In an exclusive way. For “premium consumers”. “We treat members as human beings,” said Yusuf, “not very rich people.”Yusuf’s key insight is that even if you’re as rich as Croesus, you still need a digital Jeeves – an all-purpose concierge service – to fix things for you, discreetly, effortlessly, infallibly. I didn’t even try to download the Velocity app. It can probably spot if you’re not a billionaire.A View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityA View from the Top: ViaVan London chief Jess Oppetit A View from the Top: SlimFast boss Lindsay Reisser-WestonA View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techZia Yusuf, 32, did not come from money. Born in a village outside Aberdeen, he is the son of Sri Lankan parents. His father is a paediatrician for the NHS and his mother is a nurse. At the age of 13 he had a moment that he still recalls fondly, when his father came into his room and said, “Do you want to go to Disney World?” He had always wanted to go to Disney in Paris, but his father said, “We’re not going there, we’re going to the original in Florida!” They had scrimped and saved and maxed out the credit card and it was still 10 months in the future – and the young Yusuf was so excited he could hardly sleep for the last month. “But it was something to look forward too. That’s what we try to provide at Velocity. It’s about making you feel like a kid again.”He went to Hampton School, then studied international relations at the LSE. In his final year he signed up for Merrill Lynch, for the sake of “peace of mind”. But this was in 2008. After Lehman Brothers went to the wall he got in touch with the guy who had given him the job, just to make sure everything was still in place. He got an automated message back: “This person is no longer with the company…” Nothing is plain sailing. Everything always goes wrong. Unless, that is, you’re a Velocity member. There’s a story by Kafka of a bloke who goes up to an open door but the doorman keeps him waiting outside for years until he is finally dying and then he slams it shut. Tough. Velocity is like that, but the exact opposite. There’s a guy holding the door open and ushering you through it very respectfully wherever you go. If you’re a member, you’re walking on a red carpet the whole world over. You get the top table at the Ivy or a seat at the Wimbledon final. If you want to go surfing, they’ll arrange the perfect wave, with palm trees and sultry breezes, just for you. If you’re looking for the Holy Grail, it’s here, somewhere on the app. You want the moon? Have it. Have two. You have a dream? Dream no longer. “We’re a tech company,” says Yusuf, pushing a perfect mini-croissant in my direction. “But tech is a means not an end in itself.” The average “basket size” is $2,500. The biggest is $500k – for a single transaction. Client data is sacrosanct. No harvesting or marketing. Trust is paramount. F Scott Fitzgerald reckoned that “the very rich are different from you and me”. Ernest Hemingway replied, “Yes, they have more money.” Yusuf is more of the Hemingway school of thought. It was while at Goldman Sachs that he realised two things. One is that the super-rich have exactly the same anxieties and desires as everyone else. And the other is that they are not “leading crazy lives of hedonistic pleasure”. “They’re obsessed with what they do. They have more capital, but they suffer from time poverty.” Velocity gives them time back again by doing everything for them at the click of a button. Check the app. You want to go and swim with blue whales? It’s done. You want to… and here, glancing through the app, I come across something so sublime that I am not even allowed to say what it is. “As easy as ordering an Uber.” There is no hassle. Hassle has been abolished in the great and glorious realm of Velocity. It is, I have to concede, a wonderful world. Velocity was born in 2014 and launched in public after two years of development. “We (Yusuf and co-founder Alex Macdonald) agreed with Elon Musk – it can’t be slightly better, it’s got to be amazing.” They can do something as simple and sentimental as picking up your grandma at the airport too. And there is a romantic side. They have now arranged 14 full marriage proposals, always in the perfect setting, with (so far) 100 per cent success rate. I imagine they can do orces too, in a beautiful way. Yusuf himself used his own app recently. He had almost forgotten his mother’s birthday. Velocity stepped in and saved the day: a Sri Lankan-style dinner at Hoppers in London. “My Mum is hard to please,” says Yusuf, but she was delighted. “It was a lot better than an e-card.” He’s going to take her on safari the next time.It’s hard not to agree with Yusuf that “the paradox is that we have the ability to go and do more than any generation in history. But our tendency is to order in a pizza and binge on Netflix.” He wants to get busy people out into the real world again – effortlessly. And he stresses a surprisingly ethical dimension to the whole business. It’s not just about arranging meaningful and magical moments, or even matrimony. These experiences can actually make a difference to the wider world because the people having them also have a lot of power. Yusuf cites the case of a CEO who went on a “giraffe collaring” adventure with a team of conservationists. “He came out of it a changed man. His company went green overnight and he killed all single-use plastic cups. And our platform made it happen. Nothing beats an experience for changing your view of the world.” Which is why the velocity.black website has a special section called “impact”. “It all sounds great,” said a hard-working single mother who was giving me a lift later in the day, as I was coming down from Cloud 9. There was just a hint of bitterness in her voice. “I would like to go swimming with whales and tagging giraffes. Can I join?” “Of course you can,” I replied, soothingly. “You just have to win the lottery first.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He would ring, to tell me what the weather was like over there, while I was suffering, in grey, wet, chilly London. Or how, he was enjoying some fine, French wine he’d taken specially while sitting with his feet dangling in the warm, balmy sea.Not any more. So far, the phone has lain silent. Although after reading this, he might ring again, as he did in the summer, because I wrote something he did not agree with. Once again, I was treated to a volley of abuse, much of it too crude to repeat here.It’s been a recurring theme of 2018, the PR demise of Sir Philip Green or “PG” as he is known throughout the sector and City. When the year began, he’d still not recovered from the fallout over the sale of BHS to someone who did not have the financial muscle to take on a business of that size, and Green’s subsequent refusal to plug the company’s pension deficit. He did cough up, eventually, and only after much protest.Then, came Oliver Shah’s excellent biography, Damaged Goods: the Inside Story of Sir Philip Green, the Collapse of BHS and the Death of the High Street. It painted a colourful picture of Green, and his swaggering, bruising manner.That was followed by the revelation that Green had gagged former employees from detailing his sexual and racial harassment – claims that he vehemently denies.Finally, Green’s Arcadia group was exposed to what was a horrid shopping season. It certainly was an annus horribilis for him, reputation-wise, not that he would ever reach for a polite Latin phrase as the Queen once famously did – Green would opt for a more Anglo-Saxon wording.Sir Philip Green’s and Simon Cowell business partnership Spare a thought for poor old billionaire Philip GreenSir Philip Green’s net worth and retail empireWhen he looks back on where it all went wrong – to apply some context he remains incredibly wealthy, is still a high street force, retains his knighthood, and became a grandfather, but there’s no doubt he’s suffered – he only has himself to blame.That sense of self, of believing entirely in his own gifts, has propelled him to great heights. He’s a natural, intuitive, aggressive deal-maker, blessed with an uncanny propensity for mental arithmetic. Whether he’s a genius at the longer game of retailing is a moot point. Certainly, he knew how to build an empire, and to keep it buoyant – for a while. But did he read the long-term runes, and foresee the advent of online shopping, and did he exhibit the same fleetness of foot as some of his competitors?Green is not someone who responds constructively to criticism. If the media and politicians attack his convoluted financial arrangements that see the business vested in the name of his wife who lives in Monaco as a way of avoiding tax, he will roar his defiance.A more publicly empathetic person, one who cares deeply about how they’re perceived, who can see that the tax line will dog him constantly and be wheeled out as a weapon to beat him with, might end the arrangement and swallow the resulting hefty bill. But they would regard it as a price worth paying, for better treatment by the press and parliament, for a favourable public standing.Not Green. Similarly, from the off, as soon as the BHS affair blew up, he could have made a payment to cover the pension gap into an escrow account, and leave the lawyers to sort out the fine detail. But he chose not to.He complained that his opponents liked to focus on his extravagant, bling lifestyle. Meanwhile, he would order another superyacht, so that he owned not one, but two. His reasoning was that his spending was none of their concern, that what he did with his money was up to him. He would describe his lavish parties as private, but then call journalists to invite them to listen, down the line, as George Michael did a sound-check.He’s never fully appreciated that he is also a public figure, a modern celebrity, who courted publicity for himself and for his fashion products, who liked to be photographed surrounded by supermodels. In many town centres, his outlets play a vital role, as anchor tenants, central to the wellbeing of the shopping districts and accompanying communities. Green is a major employer, responsible for several tens of thousands of jobs. He cannot have it both ways.As with many kings, his world is also that of a court. His advisers are courtiers, there, possibly, to please not help, to say “can” rather than “can’t”, and “yes” not “no”. It’s questionable, whether his actions and the blows to his image are the result of receiving bad advice, or disregarding good advice and preferring to do his own thing. Whatever the answer, he became badly unstuck in 2018. For that, he was my Man of the Year, but for all the wrong reasons.For anyone looking at how not to manage communications, how to make a bad public relations situation worse, Green’s last 12 months is a textbook tour de force.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

For the moment, a new battery costs only £25 – but once the new year arrives, that will rocket up to as much as £65.Old batteries can cause significant problems for their owners as iPhones age. With use, the power begins to drop – something that can lead to phones lasting for much less time, and to Apple having to slow down phones to ensure that they don\u0027t crash because they\u0027re not getting enough power.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt was the revelation that Apple was doing that – throttling performance on older phones, in line with more spectacular rumours that swirled before it was admitted – that led to the cheap repairs in the first place.When that story came out over the Christmas period in 2017, Apple apologised and said that as part of a range of ways of making it up to customers it would knock down the price of replacements, allowing people to restore their phone\u0027s performance if their battery had been degraded.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/gettyimages-669005400.jpg","title":"lady gaga enigma las vegas residency reviews setlist tickets","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Three if I’m lucky!’”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialLady Gaga’s Las Vegas residency is the role she was born to playA history of Las Vegas residencies, from Liberace to Lady GagaKendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga and Thom Yorke up for Best Original Song“There’s a short encore to properly conclude the show once Enigma departs. In an oversized march shirt that has her Bowie-inspired “Poker Face” lightning bolt cutting through a silhouette of her body, she sings one last song: “Shallow,” the runaway hit from A Star Is Born.\u0026nbsp“The moment is a balm, and its one that makes sure the show’s time machine takes us right back to the present, reminding us how far she’s come and the many lives she’s lived after taking us on a tour of her own musical history. She performs ‘Shallow’ as Ally Maine does towards the end of the film after becoming a full-fledged pop idol.”The review concludes: “For a show that at first seemed like an excuse to remind us what Gaga is best at, it ended up becoming a show that confirms and begins her legacy.”“Enigma\u0026nbspis a generous show, by Vegas pop standards, not just by exceeding the standard get-‘em-out-onto-the-slot-machines set length, but because Gaga also happens to do almost two hours more of actual singing than some of her counterparts on the Strip,” Variety said. “Watching Gaga do what she does best — even better than act, still — is all the story or connecting thread a show needs. She and ‘Born This Way’ were both born to be in Vegas, and to raise the bar for superstar residencies just a little bit higher.”Entertainment Weekly said: “Enigma is Gaga’s way of sharing an epiphany that we can only assume she’s recently experienced and strove to manifest creatively in the way that best suits her.\u0026nbsp“At some point, Gaga lost who she was — whether by her own fault, or the machine around her, is only for her to say — but Enigma, in as much as we need from it, serves as her way of affirming that she’s never been more secure in who she is, and that the most atypical parts of Lady Gaga are just as present and valid as the parts we perhaps have told her we’d have an easier time accepting.”Created with Sketch.Albums of the year 2018 Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

But the mood has been shifting since Britney Spears began drawing a younger, hipper crowd with her 2013-2017 Piece of Me show, which earned the MGM Park casino hotel around $135m (£107m) in ticket sales alone. While that show was something of a comeback – albeit for a relatively young performer – Bruno Mars signed up for his 2016 residency at the peak of his commercial and critical success and made 24K showbiz magic of it.“Gaga has reportedly been given $100 million reasons to deliver a two-year residency (also at the MGM Park). She’s an even better fit for Vegas than Spears or Mars: she is capable of both visually excessive pop and elegant old-school jazz.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  This time around, almost everyone got the update within a matter of minutes. If people weren\u0027t seeing it when they opened their app, force quitting and scrolling around appeared to prompt the app to update.Why Instagram just completely changed its feedBut now some users report that the change has switched back, with the feed going upright all over again. It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/28/01/michael-palin-getty.jpg","title":"new year honours 2019 michael palin knight culture full list","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

On Monday the Dow Jones closed at its worst point since September 2017, the S\u0026ampP 500 hit its lowest mark since April 2017 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at its worst point since July 2017.By contrast, when markets reopened on Wednesday the Dow Jones recorded its largest ever single-day increase while the S\u0026ampP 500 and Nasdaq both rose by 5 per cent.

Markets have also been rocked by general global political and economic uncertainty: Donald Trump is said to be preparing to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, and the US government shutdown is set to continue into the new year. Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Mariah Carey\u0027s All I Want For Christmas Is You: is at number two, while\u0026nbspWham\u0027s Last Christmas finished up the top three.

It is certainly shaping up to be a historic start to the new year for MPs returning to the chamber.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

I don’t understand the logic of that.”UK spends over £100m on extra ferries to ease no-deal Brexit pressuresSeaborne said in a statement it had been working since 2017 on plans to reintroduce ferry sailings from Ramsgate from early 2019 and has been “financed by the shareholders” during a development phase.The company said this had involved ”locating suitable vessels, making arrangements with the ports of Ostend and Ramsgate, building the infrastructure – such as bunkering – as well as crewing the ferries once they start operating”.It added: “It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons.“This coincides with the Department for Transport’s (DfT) freight capacity purchase agreement with Seaborne which is part of their preparations to increase ferry capacity in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit.”The firm was founded by industry veterans, its chief executive Ben Sharp told the BBC.Ramsgate has not had a cross-Channel service since 2013, when operators TransEuropa collapsed.\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said: “That the government has reportedly signed a contract with a ferry company with no ferries pretty much sums up their farcical approach to the entire Brexit fiasco.“The government could, and should, take the threat of a no-deal Brexit off the table. It is being used only to try and scaremonger people into backing their deal. It is now costing the country millions – it is inexcusable and people won’t be fooled.“People must be given the final say on the Brexit deal with a people’s vote where they have the right to choose to remain.”Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: “Never has it been clearer that our government is selling us down the river over Brexit.“A firm that has never run a ferry service before has been awarded a multi-million pound contract and they don’t even have any ships.“We know our ports aren’t ready for a no-deal disaster, but is hiring a firm that’s never dealt with this kind of thing before really going to help? This idea should have been sunk before it saw the light of day.”A DfT spokesman added: “This contract was awarded in the full knowledge that Seaborne Freight is a new shipping provider, and that the extra capacity and vessels would be provided as part of its first services.“As with all contracts, we carefully vetted the company’s commercial, technical and financial position in detail before making the award.”Created with Sketch.

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

Nine minutes und kounting!”Here in Brexit-crazed Westminster, that scene sounds all too familiar.There are now fewer than  days until we are scheduled to leave the European Union on March .As European Commission bigshots like to say: “The clock is ticking.”Heaven knows what is going to happen: Will British Prime Minister Theresa May — still alive, and even a little stronger than she was a couple of weeks ago — elicit assurances from Brussels that will help her sell her Withdrawal Agreement deal to a sceptical House of Commons Will pro-Remain MPs somehow force a second referendum that could stop Brexit  Will we sail out of the EU without a treaty The only thing anyone knows for sure is that this particular thriller must soon end.By March , we will knowthe villain has succeeded in his dastardly plot or  can again save the world.Because, let’s face it, we’re not going to let the baddie win.Pessimists tend to prosper in uncertain times, and British politics at present is very much a catastrophists’ market.Critics and doomsayers are agitating more noisily as the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal becomes more likely.We’re being told British shops will run out of food and medicines, aeroplanes will be grounded and the economy could shrink by as much as eight per cent that’s the Bank of England’s worst-case scenariowe leave the EU without a deal in place.Officials in both London and Brussels are talking publicly about contingency planning, while Labour and pro-EU Tory MPs have repeatedly pressed May to rule it out.In the last Cabinet meeting of the year, Work And Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd supposedly compared Brexit to a car crash and Justice Secretary David Gauke said the concept of a “managed no-deal” was as mythical as a unicorn.But doomsayers should hold their fire — Britain will be just fine.Evensome instability does follow a no-treaty withdrawal, it would be short-term. Le would continue. Chickens would continue to lay eggs.Trading restrictions work both ways, so any attempt by Brussels to punish the disobedient Brits by preventing them exporting agricultural goods to the EU might encourage the British government to find sudden reasons to stop the importation of German motor cars. Or Irish beef. Or French wine.Have you tried new-world merlots  They can be rather good. And good value.No-deal would, in fact, have tremendous advantages.It would allow Britain immediately to negotiate and sign trade deals beyond Europe.It would force May’s government to cut taxes to make us more competitive.It would result in a tremendous boost to national unity.Before the EU starts feeling too sorry for us — or too eager to see the back of us — it might consider that in the long term, it has far greater problems on the horizon than we do.When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble — our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.Because there’s no denying it is deeply troubled.Belgium’s government is in turmoil — yet again.France’s peacock president is having his feathers plucked by a bolshy populace.The German chancellor is soon to depart this political le.Italy and Brussels may have papered over their rancorous dispute over Rome’s spending proposals, but neither is likely to play nice for long.Spain has a hideous unemployment problem and poor Greece, the crucible of Western democracy, has lost control of its own affairs and is turning into a Third World country.Poland and Hungary, of course, are pursuing non-liberal policies that have earned them the contempt of the European institutions.And all this before we even start contemplating Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s hiccups.Britain’s political class may be in agony over a “Leave” instruction it resents, but the country’s electorate is markedly more relaxed.January and February  are likely to prove noisy in Westminster, but by the end of March — one way or another — we will be out.That James Bond countdown will end and our ab-dabs will start to abate.The EU’s nightmare, alas, will continue.The question in Britain will then not be “why did we leave ” but “why did it take us so long ”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And, without our cash, the EU now realises there will be a massive black hole in their coffers.EU chiefs mistakenly thought they had us over a barrel and could use their leverage to get whatever they wanted.But they are now waking up to the fact that Theresa May’s Brexit deal is unlikely to get the nod and, with no deal legally our default position, a clean break looms.The refusal to give our PM any concessions does not look so wise now.The Sun has long questionedthe EU would ever prioritise their economies and citizens’ jobs over a zealous desire to punish Britain for leaving.Perhaps Mr Oettinger’s comments suggest that reality is finally dawning.IT is shocking that Britain has just TWO boats to police , miles of shoreline.Organised gangs are taking advantage of our easily penetrable coast to traffick desperate people who will risk their lives in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to get here.As many as  people have tried to cross over from France in just two months. How many more have slipped in under the radar If these people aren’t discouraged from taking such lethal risks then Britain’s beaches and ports will become as tempting as those in Spain and Italy.Our Government must stop more arriving. And France, too, needs to take responsibility. President Macron must not allow Calais to be turned into another giant Jungle camp.Otherwise there will be needless blood on all of our hands.THE Sun’s Keep it Down campaign, launched in  to freeze fuel duty, has succeeded in putting an extra £billion into consumers’ pockets. Good.Without it, petrol prices could have risen to a shocking £. a litre. But away from the petrol pumps, motorists are still getting a raw deal.Over half a million potholes were reported last year. The amount has risen  per cent in the last two years.It’s about time the Treasury puts the tax it claws from motorists towards properly looking after our roads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Seaborne Freight was one of three companies awarded contracts totalling poundm last week, tasked with laying on extra crossings to ease pressure on Dover. It wants to run freight ferries from Ramsgate to Ostend in Belgium, starting with two ships in late March and increasing to four by the end of the summer. But a Conservative county councillor for the Kent port said it wasnt believe possible to set up a new service from Ramsgate by the scheduled Brexit date of March .   Councillor Paul Messenger questioned the contract, telling the BBC: It has no ships and no trading history so how can due diligence be done  Why choose a company that never moved a single truck in their entire history and give them pound million  I dont understand the logic of that. Seaborne was set up two years ago and has been in negotiations about running freight ferries between Ramsgate and Ostend, but no services are currently running. And narrow berths in the port mean there are few suitable commercial vessels available. In a statement, the company said it had been working since  on plans to reintroduce ferry sailings from Ramsgate from early .   The business has been financed by the shareholders during a development phase involving locating suitable vessels, making arrangements with the ports of Ostend and Ramsgate, building the infrastructure - such as bunkering - as well as crewing the ferries once they start operating. It added: It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons. This coincides with the Department for Transports Freight Capacity Purchase Agreement with Seaborne which is part of their preparations to increase ferry capacity in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said: That the Government has reportedly signed a contract with a ferry company with no ferries pretty much sums up their farcical approach to the entire Brexit fiasco.   The Government could, and should, take the threat of a no-deal Brexit off the table. It is being used only to try and scaremonger people into backing their deal. It is now costing the country millions - it is inexcusable and people wont be fooled. And Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi said: Never has it been clearer that our Government is selling us down the river over Brexit. A firm that has never run a ferry service before has been awarded a multi-million pound contract and they dont even have any ships. We know our ports arent ready for a no-deal disaster, but is hiring a firm thats never dealt with this kind of thing before really going to help  This idea should have been sunk before it saw the light of day. A Department for Transport spokesman added: This contract was awarded in the full knowledge that Seaborne Freight is a new shipping provider, and that the extra capacity and vessels would be provided as part of its first services. As with all contracts, we carefully vetted the companys commercial, technical and financial position in detail before making the award.

George Reginald Oliver Molyneux Herbert is one of  aristocrats competing in a hereditary peer by-election in the House of Lords. Only hereditary peers can stand in the bizarre poll, a hangover from attempts to reform the Lords, and only members of the House of Lords can vote. The winner will be able to shape laws and claim pound a day until they die or retire - a situation previously branded a mockery of our democracy. The -year-old th Earl of Carnarvon lives with his countess we in Highclere Castle on a ,-acre estate in Hampshire. The lavish house with a state dining room, library and smoking room was used as the home of the Crawley family in ITVs fictional period drama.   His ancestor the rd Earl remodelled the sprawling manor, whose origins date to AD, in the s into the stately home that is now famous around the world. And the th Earl practiced digging in its grounds before joining forces with Howard Carter to discover the tomb of Tutankhamun in Egypt. Tours of the estate cost pound a head while a Valentines Day tour with afternoon tea costs pound for a couple. In a manesto to fellow peers, the th Earl said owning his home has given him experience of small business, farming, tourism and countryside heritage matters that would help him in the House of Lords.  He added the residences renown gives him an international outlook to the world through Highcleres presence online. He also wrote he could bring experience from investing and working in software and technology, and promised to take part in committees and debates. But Shadow Cabinet Minister Jon Trickett said: When the ‘Earl of Downton Abbey’ has a greater chance of getting into Parliament than any one of the millions of working people of this country, you know our political system is simply not fit for purpose. With more people than ever wanting a say in how things are run, it’s simply not acceptable to choose our lawmakers by having  aristocrats compete for the votes of a few hundred other aristocrats. It’s time for a radical overhaul of how politics is done, so it works in the interests of the many, and not the few. The election is a hangover from Tony Blairs bid to modernise the House of Lords. Hereditary peers were mostly cast out in  but  remained as a compromise. That means when one dies or retires, remaining hereditary peers get first refusal on the seat, and only members of the House of Lords can vote. The latest election is being held to replace Tory Lord Skelmersdale, an Old Etonian who sat in the Lords for  years before his death in October.  Ten of the  candidates are Conservatives, five are independent crossbenchers and one, Lord Cadman, has not declared a party affiliation. Rival candidates include -year-old Lord Biddulph, whose entire manesto is the words always happy to serve, and Viscount Mountgarret, whose family own , acres of land devoted to game hunting in North Yorkshire. Other candidates include retired Navy commander the Earl of Effingham and state secondary school teacher Lord Hampton. Peers will be invited to cast their ballot in the opulent Queens robing room in the House of Lords on January . They can also vote by post. The by-election, expected to cost just over pound, to run, is the fourth of its kind since the start of . Darren Hughes, Chief Executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said earlier this year hereditary peer by-elections are an undemocratic farce and make mockery of our democracy. Downton Abbey creator Lord Fellowes is already a non-hereditary Tory peer after being elevated to the Lords by David Cameron in .  peers join the Lords - despite PMs promises By BEN GLAZE, Deputy Political Editor Some  new peers have been appointed to the House of Lords this year – despite Theresa May promising to slash the size of the bloated Second Chamber. Scottish National Party spokesman Tommy Sheppard said it was inexcusable successive governments had continued to make chummy political appointments to the Upper House, at an annual cost to the taxpayer of pound, per peer. The  new members in  included nine Conservatives, six crossbenchers, three from Labour and one from the Democratic Unionist Party, as well as three bishops.  The SNP does not take seats in the Lords on principle. Mr Sheppard said: The idea of an unelected legislature in the st Century is ridiculous enough, but for successive governments to continue to pile the Lords chamber full of chummy political appointments is inexcusable. The argument to consign this archaic and undemocratic chamber of political has-beens to the dustbin of history is long overdue. Last year, figures showed that each peer costs the taxpayer pound, per year and since then, no less than  Lords have been stuffed into the House.  Whilst many households and families across the UK spend the festive season worrying how to pay their food and fuel bills, unelected peers enjoy a pound tax-free daily allowance for as little as  minutes attendance.” However, a Lords spokesman said the overall number of members fell by  over the year to  because  members had left. It was on track to meet a target of , he added. He branded the pound, figure misleading, saying it represented the total Lords budget ided by the number of members, rather than reflecting the cost of each inidual peer to taxpayers. The Mirror has been campaigning to scrap the unelected House of Lords. The Earl of Carnarvon defended putting his hat in the ring saying:I hoped I could make a contribution to what helps us build icommunities, prosperity and rural sustainability.

It comes as the US Coastguard said it had ended the search for -year-old at about .pm on Thursday, two days after he reportedly went overboard in unknown circumstances. The -year-old was starring in a musical production of Grease on board Harmony of the Seas, the second-largest cruise ship in the world. Arrons sister Emilie paid tribute to her brother by changing her cover photo on Facebook to one of him leaping into the air during a dance routine.  She received hundreds of messages of support as another relative Rebecca Hough described him as our superstar alongside a clip of him performing. Back in June, Emilie had posted a picture of her giving Arron a kiss on the cheek after he landed the job on the cruise. She captioned the snap: Words can’t describe how proud I am of my not so little brother. I can’t believe how much you’ve grown and how far you’ve become! Seeing you graduate today was one of the proudest moments of my le! Can’t believe he’s leaving me for  month to join the Royal Caribbean and sail around the world! I love you. Arrons friends also posted messages with Lucy Devereaux writing: In our hearts always my love.  One wrote on Facebook: I’ve lost a part of my soul. I love you my Arron Hough. Another added: I am in total shock and disbelief. Praying that it isnt true. Mr Hough had been working on the bn Harmony of the Seas for only a few months, and his mum, Tracey Steel, wrote loving and supportive messages on his frequent Facebook posts while he was thousands of miles from home. After his first week on board Harmony of the Seas in October, she wrote: So so proud I could burst my beautul amazing boy. I Love You. Do you know Arron Hough  Email webnews@mirror. She wrote I love you son under his last post on December , which featured photos from Cozumel, Mexico. Last week, she wrote:If my love for you was stars it would light up the universe. Mr Hough, from Sunderland, disappeared from the Royal Caribbean ship on Christmas Day. The vessel, named Harmony Of The Seas, was  milesnorth-west of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, at the time and was travelling to Philipsburg, St Maarten. The last CCTV footage available of Mr Hough showed him heading on to the ships deck at around am, according to a statement issued by Royal Caribbean. However, staff on board the ship only realised he was missing when he did not report to work later that day.  The United States Coast Guard was alerted to Mr Houghs disappearance at .pm, nearly  hours after hes believed to have gone missing. Royal Caribbean and the coast guard were unable to confirm how far the ship had travelled during that time. Just three days before he vanished, he wrote on Twitter: Beneath the water is beauty. Always look beneath the surface before you decide on things. In an earlier post on December , he wrote: Gonna kill someone f***ing hell. It is unclear what Mr Hough was referring to in his tweets, but he posted regular updates from his time on board the vessel and his off-days at sun-drenched destinations. Earlier this month, he posted a screen grab of a status pointing out that many people lead fake lives on social media, pretending they are leading happy and exciting existences. The original author of the status was not known, but it read: So.. social media is the killer of people.. the fake lives we live on social media pretending to all of our followers that were having such an amazing crazy ride when actually were not.. we struggle, we havehard times but we hide this with throwbacks and happy pictures we post.. which is fine to keep sadness on the DL.  The ,-ft long vessel was sailing from its home port in Florida to the French-Dutch island of Saint Martin, with , passengers and crew on board at the time of Houghs disappearance. CCTV showed him entering an area on Deck  - which includes a spa, the Royal Theater, a number of bars, restaurants and shops, and the main dining room - but he was never seen again. It appears no-one noticed Mr Hough was missing for several hours. He didnt show up for work, and CCTV was reviewed and a ship-wide search was launched. The circumstances of his fall were unclear. He is the fth person to go overboard on a cruise ship since November. None of the previous four people - including a British man - was found as most werent reported missing until hours later. Mr Hough is the second British man to go overboard from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship in a little over a month.  Jack Daniel Ackroyd, , from Cotgrave, Nottinghamshire, was working on the Adventure of the Seas when he vanished at about am on November . He was reported missing when he did not show up for work while the ship was at port in Cozumel, Mexico. A search was launched but he was not found. In September , one Harmony of the Seas crew member was killed and four were injured when a le boat broke loose and plunged from the fth deck during a security training exercise while it was docked in Marseille, France.

Ian and Linda Simpson were seen beaming with joy beside their granddaughter, Alice, after signing an out-of-court agreement to bring her to live in Britain. They agreed to pay more than pound, to the family of their grandchildrens Chinese mum - who brutally stabbed their son, Michael, to death last year. Last night, they were preparing to fly back with little Alice. But the youngsters homecoming is filled with heartache - because Ian and Linda have been forced to leave their eight-year-old grandson, Jack, behind.   The desperate pair, who continue to fight for custody of the two siblings, had been faced with the agonising choice to bring just Alice back - or neither child. This is because Jacks Chinese grandparents, who live in the northwestern city of Nanzhang, are refusing to give the boy up, The Mail on Sunday reports. On Boxing Day, as his gran Hu De Xiu packed a bag up for his little sister, the youngster reportedly wept and pleaded with her: Don’t let Alice go. We are overjoyed to bring Alice home but it breaks our hearts to leave Jack behind, Ian, now married to a second we, told the newspaper yesterday. Linda cried and asked me, How can we wrench them apart    He added that, in the end, he and his ex-we had to choose between bringing Alice home or walking away without either of their grandchildren. We could have lost them both for ever, he said. Ian and Lindas son Michael was killed in March  when he was kned by his estranged we, Weiwei Fu, in a jealous rage at his Shanghai apartment. The Next executive, who had met and married Fu after moving to China before they split up, had planned a university education for Alice and Jack. He had taken the youngsters around the world and gave them a western view, retired business project consultant Ian said in an interview earlier this year.   He added at the time said: “We lost our son and feel we can’t lose the children as well. They’re too precious... We can give them the le Michael wanted for them. We’d make sure they stayed in touch with their Chinese relatives.” Ian and Linda, who have spent more than pound, in their bid to get custody of Alice and Jack, spent time with their grandson in Nanzhang last week. They played with him at a hotel restaurant, as Fus parents looked on. Devastatingly, the two childrens Chinese relatives have allegedly told them that their parents are working abroad and that Michael abandoned them. But in reality, the father was stabbed to death by their mother, who is now serving le in prison after being locked up for murder this summer.   Ian, of Hartest, Suffolk, said earlier this year: That’s the lie they’ve been given but they’ll find out eventually. It’s terrible. He added that the kids were living in a one-bedroom flat containing five people, including their grandparents and cousin, in a small town. The granddad and Linda had previously enjoyed a close relationship with Alice and Jack. But after their sons murder, they were allegedly refused contact. The pair launched a heartbreaking battle for custody, which saw Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt raise the case on a visit to Beijing in July. Supporters also raised thousands to help the family. Ian and Linda ended up paying pound, in cash to Fus relatives.   They have reached an agreement that there will be weekly phone calls between Alice and Jack, as well as annual visits, the Mail on Sunday reports. Now, as they prepare to bring their granddaughter back to the UK, they are determined to keep up their fight until Jack can join them too. They say Alice is already missing her big brother. She has been amazingly brave but there have been moments when she has been in tears asking for her brother, Ian said. The grandparents have been supported in their battle by the Foreign Office.

Australian minister Andrew Broad, , is said to have told the Irish woman in her s: I know how to f*** my woman, along with other sexually suggestive remarks after meeting via an online dating website. The woman has been named by media in Australia as Amy Keating, , from Dublin. She is said to have used the online alias of “Sweet Sophia Rose” on the Seeking Arrangement dating site, reports the Irish Mirror. Her father has since branded her a bloody eejit over the drama and said she is as naive as they come, at times.   Amy and Mr Broad are said to have exchanged online messages before the politician flew to Hong Kong to meet at an upmarket sky bar boasting city views. While there, Amy claims the dad-of-one compared himself to James Bond, put his hand on her knee and moaned about the menu prices. She said the incident went no further than the restaurant because she felt uncomfortable and left early.She also claims he lied about his age saying he was , seven years younger than his real age. Later that evening, it is alleged she sent a text to the politician telling him to pay her “the allowance” of , Hong Kong dollarsinto her Paypal account or  she would go public. She reportedly stated: “I’m fully aware of how much more I could getI went public to the papers with my story”. It is understood that he did not pay her, but instead referred the text to Australian police, who said the matter was outside their jurisdiction. Amy then went public and her claims were published in gossip magazine New Idea. After the messages were revealed, Mr Broad quit his position as Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister. The furore has also threatened to bring down the government, which is facing claims it knew about the messages two weeks before they were exposed.   According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s office were aware the messages were the subject of potential legal proceedings. Amys claims were published in New Idea magazine along with some of the messages the pair are said to have sent before they met. It reports in one message, Mr Broad said: “I’m an Aussie lad, I know how to ride a horse, fly a plane and f*** my woman. My intentions are completely dishonourable.” She said another text message from him read: “I’ve booked a flashy room to seduce you back to.” When she told him she found Australian accents sexy, he is said to have replied: “I pull you close, run my strong hands down your back, softly kiss your neck and whisper ‘G’day mate’.” Amy’s father has now defended her, claiming “she is not a lady of the night by any manner or means”, and would never resort to blackmail. He said she has a masters level education, and is working in Hong Kong after being transferred there by her company.  Speaking to the Sunday Independent, he said: “She has made many a mistake. “She is as naive as they come, at times. But I am glad that she did what she did at the restaurant. “But do I think she covered herself in glory afterwards  Absolutely not. I thought she was a bloody eejit. An absolute idiot. Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Seeking Arrangement has said the site will not be taking action against Amy for going public. Spokeswoman Brook Urick said: “There weren’t any terms of use broken here, they both were using the site in a way we deem appropriate. She suggested Amy’s actions “speaks to the climate of women after the #MeToo movement, they don’t want to see that anymore and they’re going to take control as much as they can”.

Australia’s Herald Sun newspaper reported three women contacted party officials over the past  months about alleged inappropriate behaviour online and in bars.

For Christmas I bought both daughters a puzzle, and one of them got a microscope and the other has a spirograph. Theyve also got clothes and shoes, all preloved. My newborn has got a push walker - a little dog with a jumper on. Katie, who has this year had her third child with GP husband Chris, , managed the whole year with only one blip. She bought a new school unorm for her youngest daughter, who started education this year. She continued: Weve mostly stuck to nothing new, my daughter started school so we had to buy a unorm. Id say weve spent maybe pound in the whole year, Im sure I have saved at least pound over the course of the year. Weve still bought food and everyday essentials, but we use charity shops mostly.   Its a habit that weve gotten into, you can find pretty much anything in charity shops or on eBay, you dont need to buy things new. The children are always excited when I come home, I bought my daughter a jumper with alpacas on it and she loves it. It doesnt have to cost much for it to matter to them. Katie said that with just a little effort they were able to live a le better than when they were more frivolously spending money. But when it comes to Christmas day they will be having a traditionally festive meal, but theyre still debating over Turkey or Goose. She said: Were still deciding, but we will be having a traditional Christmas with family. Weve put together a hamper of food and weve got my mother-in-law a pair of socks. They were a certain kind so I bought them brand new, they were pound.   Katie changed her lestyle and became compelled to act after she was shocked at how expensive it was raising small children. She realised that her children were getting through clothes at a lightning pace, and that her garage and attic were quickly filling with discarded items that had barely being worn. But then it dawned on Katie that other mothers were likely experiencing the same thing, and that there must be a treasure-trove of barely-worn childrens clothes out there. Katie launched her web project called One Baby Owner as a place for parents to sell nearly-new items that their young ones have outgrown. But now Katie has had to put the website on hold as she focuses on raising her own three children. She said: Ive had to put that aside for now, Im too busy raising my children. I hope to pick it up again sometime soon. Items Katie has bought second hand this year:a little dolls house for her daughters birthday Victorian sleigh twin beds for my daughters vintage chairs for the lounge a set of plates and bowls for the kitchen coats for all three children kitchen chairs paint fabric for curtains clothes including a skirt, two pairs of jeans, four jumpers, and a leather jacket a Christmas jumper some pottery pieces by local artist Tony Bristow a rug bedding tea towels cushions a second-hand oven from eBaybedroom storage boxes for the girls room a wardrobe"},{"url":null,"title":"glass explodes haunted snooker club","story":"NewsGlass explodes at haunted snooker club in front of shocked puntersPeople are ided over whether science or the supernatural caused the spooky scene in Whitley BayShareCommentsByIan JohnsonMark Chandler:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video glass-explodes-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPunters were left stunned after a glass spontaneously exploded inside a haunted snooker hall. CCTV footage captured the moment the empty glass shattered at the club in Whitely Bay, despite there being no one near it. The incident left bar staff and customers shocked - and unsureit was the result of heat or a ghostly presence at the bar. Kayleigh Woods, whose dad runs Whitley Lodge Snooker and Sports Bar, was sitting nearby and insists the glass was cool when it shattered. She told Chronicle Live there had been plenty of spooky goings-on inside the venue, leaving some workers terried.Kayleigh said: You hear noises in dferent rooms, and a few staff members have admitted they dont like going in after dark. A lot of people have said theyve heard stuff in the club. Ive heard someone clear their throat when there was nobody  inside. Whatever it is, I dont think it is bad or evil - but I think it could be haunted.  And she said, although club regulars were too terried to pick up their cues, there has been plenty of debate about the real cause since she shared the video online. They are especially sceptical because she recently set-up a business hunting ghosts - something she insisted was a coincidence. She said: Ive never said it is- but Ive no explanation to say it isnt. Im just open minded, and I would love it to be the case that it was.  People have said oh it has just come out the dishwasher but it cant be - because we dont have one. A customer had actually just ed it, gone to get some ice from the machine, and then it happened. Alll the customers turned around and went wheeey thinking it had been dropped - but then when they watched it back, people were like what !. They couldnt believe it.  And Kayleigh said she only shared the clip to help people make up their own minds. Online, people have been giving their views, with one writing: This has happened hundreds of times at work - can be anything from the glass getting put down to hard to it being cold and the desk being hot. Another said: Glasses tend to do this.  Most bar staff will be like oh there goes another Strongbow glass not oh my God, ghosts. But Kayleigh, who has booked a medium to visit the club in February, has insisted the video is no publicity stunt. She insisted: Anyone who knows me, knows Ive talked for years about this place being potentially haunted. It isnt something Ive conjured up - I couldnt fake that video.

The former England captain, , became an official member of the Royal Family in , when he married Zara Phillips - the Queens eldest granddaughter. Speaking about his very royal Christmas, dad-of-two Tindall revealed how the family have a surprisingly alternative Christmas day - dining on a cold buffet as opposed to roast turkey and all the trimmings. He described how the most of the festivities are played out on Christmas Eve - including the opening of presents and a black tie party in the night.  Speaking to Joe on the House of Rugby podcast, alongside fellow rugby star James Haskell, Tindall said: Christmas day is a little bit more quiet because it is a cold buffet - they give everyone the day off. Sheloves all the staff she has working for her so she gives as many the day off as she can. Their big day is on Christmas Eve - with a black tie shindig in the evening. Tindall, wearing a Christmas patterned suit, described how he likes to dress up in one of his garish festive outfits for the day - much to the Queens delights, who thinks dark colours are for sad times. He added: We open presents on Christmas Eve so I wore one of these and then just to give a little punch at breakfast, I came down in a dferent set up.  The Queen loves bright colours and thats why she wears all those amazing colours she does wear. She thinks dark colours are for sad times. While most of the palace festivities at Sandringham take place on Christmas Eve, Tindall went on to reveal how the family - including The Queen - sit down to watch the monarchs annual Christmas Day speech, before some members of the family enjoy an episode of Downton Abbey. When it comes to present buying, Zara Phillips splashes out on up to  gts, which get handed out at a Christmas meal for extended family a few weeks before the big day.  Tindall added: My we is incredible at buying presents. There will probably be each year  presents because she takes presents for every single one of them. Two weeks ago, we had the family Christmas lunch which is all the extended family - ,  people and she buys everyone presents. My we is incredible at buying presents because she takes presents for every single one of them too. Comparing his Christmases up north with his parents, Tindall described how his traditions and festive attire are very dferent. He added: Its quite a strange day becauseyoure up north, I spend the whole day in my boxer shorts or trackie bottoms. Talking about his day with the Royal Family, Tindall said: By the time Ive normally got up, Ive been to church twice, which is quite strange because Im not from a church-going background - so its completely dferent.

I would have got all the American gang over, weve got all the British dudes. It would have been the best brigade of kitchen ever.

Tim Lovejoy then tried to soften the blow and said to Jamie: I imagine they have all their chefs at Buckingham Palace doing it. Jamie, who didnt seem too disheartened, replied: They are very slick at protocol and getting those gigs done, so we probably were a bit renegade.

He previously said: The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us. “All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and thats been a point of focus for us.  We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that.all their decisions, we purely made suggestions and the couple... theyve tasted everything, theyve been involved in every detail... “We are using produce off Her Majestys estates and that features very much.

Now, its claimed Samantha, who lives in Florida, has been added to a fixated persons list by the police royalty and specialist unit, after being identied as a risk, reports The Times.  The Duchess of Sussexs personal protection officers have reportedly briefed Scotland Yard detectives from Fixated Threat Assessment Centreabout the embarrassment of another public outburst from Samantha. The FTAC website defines fixated people as those who have an obsessional preoccupationwith a person for a perceived grievance, which they pursue to an irrational degree. According to The Times, a source commented: You cant protect someone like the Duchess of Sussex without knowing the background of her family. But someone like Samantha presents a risk rather than a threat. She is not committing criminal offences, but she is causing concerns for the royal family.  There is a big potential for some major embarrassment for the royals. Samantha could make a scene and create headlines with her actions - and lets face it, shes already kind of done that. Samantha is also reportedly working on a book about growing up alongside Meghan, called In the Shadows of Duchess, previously titled The Diary of Princess Pushys Sister. Despite months of publicly slamming her sister, Samantha claims her frequent outbursts and numerous interviews with the worlds press are a way of reaching out to the pregnant Duchess in a bid to heal the family rt. In October, Samantha made an unannounced arrival at Kensington Palace, before a widely publicised Christmas Card asking for a family truce was sent to the Duchess.

I had put some bacon under the grill and then I put an egg in a jug with a bit of water - as I have done before - and popped it in the microwave for a minute.  The microwave didnt ping so I took the egg back out, popped it on the side and checked on the bacon.When I turned back towards the jug the egg exploded in my face. Courtney immediately began screaming and attempted to splash cold water on her face. She then called a friend due to the excruciating pain she was experiencing.  By this point I couldnt see and I was screaming in pain, she continued. My friend came round straightaway and he called  who told me to go straight to AE. Medics at the Royal Stoke University Hospital treated her with morphine and gauze. Doctors reassured Courtney that the burns were not serious and said that she had scratched both corneas - but stressed that her eyesight damage was not permanent.  Courtney then stayed with her mum Tracy for a couple of days after the accident. The sight in my right eye came back within  hours but I still cant see properly out of my left, said Courtney. I have eye drops and steroids and I have to go back to the eye clinic every day until my eyes have healed. Doctors have told me the sight in my left eye may not be restored for a week or maybe even longer, she added.This was the worst pain I have ever suffered - it was horric - and I would hate anyone  to have to go through what I have been through.

Less than  hours earlier, her beloved partner, Jason Francis, had died in hospital after being hit by a Dominos delivery driver. The young couple, who had moved to the country from Shropshire under a year ago, had been sweethearts since their late teens.And Alice could not bear to live without Jason, her mum said. In the hours before her suspected suicide, the young woman had been at home while her boyfriend, , was out with friends.  Rugby player Jason reportedly enjoyed a Christmas drink with his pals during the catch up on December , before a cab was called.He is then said to have called Alice, telling her he would be back at their home in Stanley Street, Scarborough,“in a couple of minutes”.However, not long after, at around pm, sirens began wailing and Alice noticed flashing lights from emergency services vehicles. She went outside to see what was happening, Perth Now reports. It would later emerge Jason had been hit by a teenage Dominos delivery driver while reportedly lying on the road by his home.As he was being rushed to Royal Perth Hospital, his worried girlfriend was working her way through the crowd at the scene.Alice, a beautul soul, apparently collapsed in grief after police told her that her boyfriend was being transported to hospital.  She quickly set off to Royal Perth, with her devastated next-door neighbour, Colette, following behind her on the advice of officers. “They [the police] said I should go to the hospital to give some comfort to Alice, who they somehow knew didn’t have any support network here. I shot off as fast as I could, Colette said.But when she arrived at the hospital, Alice had vanished.Colette and her daughter, who was with her, began searching the hospital car park and then the streets for the young woman.“We knew she would have been in a terrible state, she added.However, they sadly could not find her.It was only later, less than  hours after Jason had succumbed to his injuries, that Alice was discovered dead in Mount Hawthorn.   Her heartbroken mother, Dawn, took to social media to pay tribute to a young woman who brought light to everyones le.She wrote: I am devastated to let everyone know that my beautul daughter was so distraught she could not bear to live without her beloved Jase and chose to take her own le. My husband and I now grieve for the loss of two wonderful people that brought light to everyones le. RIP my gorgeous girlie. Colette told The Sunday Times that Alice and Jason, who had been together for eight years, were very thoughtful neighbours. Jason was a former Market Drayton FC footballer before the pair moved to Australia, where they lived in the western city of Perth. He was on the carriageway in the beachside suburb of Scarborough when he was hit by a white VW Jetta, Western Australia Police said. The vehicle was being driven by an -year-old man.   It has been claimed that Jason was lying on the road by his house when he was struck, although this remains unconfirmed.The former fireman had joined Cottelsoe rugby club at the beginning of the year after moving to the area. Sam Diamond, club president, said he understood that Alice had gone outside to investigate after seeing flashing lights.Speaking earlier, he said: She was told by first responders that it was Jason they were working on. He added she had been left heartbroken by her partners death. We dont know what happened to her after this, Sam said. I know the police have launched an inquiry into it. She has gone missing after notying some of our friends of whats happenedand hasnt been found until the next morning. The couple, described as an integral part of the club, had made a big impression on the community in their short time there.   Sam added: They were two of the finest people you could meet. They well and truly ingrained themselves in our club.Both Jase on the field and Alice off the field. Alice, who worked for a digital marketing company and was also a talented pencil sketch artist, reportedly had an infectious laugh. Meanwhile, Jason has been described as the sort of person thats always got the time of day for everyone. More than pound, has now been raised to support the couples families and to help them pay for the repatriation of their bodies.A police spokesman earlier said: Police will investigate this matter and prepare a report for the coroner, which will include the full circumstances leading to the womans death.  Officers have also appealed for witnesses to the collision in Stanley Street at around pm on December . A Dominos Pizza spokeswoman previously told : Our thoughts are with the family of the victim involved and we remain focused on the health and wellbeing of the driver involved. We will provide all necessary support during this time including counselling and support services. Dominos is working closely with the police and their ongoing investigation.

Gavin Williamson said it was time to recast the nations role worldwide, ripping up the s policy of withdrawing from regions east of Suez. Oppostion MPS immediately slammed the comments, accusing him of ignorance of military strategy and warning Brexit was making Britain a laughing stock. But, despite the huge problems besetting Theresa Mays deal, Mr Williamson insisted Brits should be much more optimistic about our future as we exit the European Union.  Mr Williamson claimed putting troops on standby to help out with Brexit was just good sensible planning to make sure that everything runs as smoothly as possible. He said: This is our biggest moment as a nation since the end of the Second World War, when we can recast ourselves in a dferent way, we can actually play the role on the world stage that the world expects us to play. For so long - literally for decades - so much of our national view point has actually been coloured by a discussion about the European Union. This is our moment to be that true global player once more - and I think the armed forces play a really important role as part of that.  Mr Williamson told the Sundayhe wanted establish a UK presence not just in the Far East but also in the Caribbean as well. He did not name possible locations, but a source said new bases, supply ships and equipment, housing service and maintenance staff, could be set-up in Singapore or Brunei in the South China Sea. They could also be sited at Montserrat or Guyana in the Caribbean within the next couple of years. Mr Williamson said: I am very much looking at how can we get as much of our resources forward based, actually creating a deterrent but also taking a British presence. We are looking at those opportunities not just in the Far East but also in the Caribbean as well.  He said there would be a political sht after Brexit, seeing the UK building deeper relationships with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Caribbean states and nations across Africa. He predicted these countries would look to the UK for the moral leadership, the military leadership and the global leadership. The Defence Secretary said recent research showed Brits under-estimated the potential for UK global influence. The research showed that while the rest of the world saw Britain standing  feet tall - when actually we stood six feet tall - Britons saw us standing five feet tall, not the six, and certainly not the , he said. Labour MP Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Peoples Vote campaign, said: Gavin Williamsons claims that Brexit would allow the UK to build bases in the Far East or the Caribbean betray an ignorance of military strategy that is worrying in a Defence Secretary.  Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second EU referendum, said: Brexit is making Britain a laughing stock, not a force to be reckoned with. If the Defence Secretary really thinks Brexit will make Britain a true global player, hes not read the reports his own Government have been producing. They tell a dferent story of Brexit Britain being put through economic ruin and being locked out of key defence capabilities which keep us safe. Lets put an end to this farce and let the public have the final say over whats best for them, including the option to stay and strengthen ourselves within Europe.

One of the things they really love to eat is crickets, but, unsurprisingly, these can be a little tricky to get hold of. Christopher Ingraham, a reporter for the Washington Post, and his family recently adopted a young bearded dragon for Christmas and they called it Holly. In order to ensure Holly was happy and eating well, Christopher ordered a shipment of crickets to his home, but when it arrived things didnt quite go the way he thought it would.  Posting on Twitter, Christopher revealed the hilarious tale to his followers and it quickly went viral, amassing over , shares and , likes. He wrote: So, a shipments of crickets for the lizard arrived via FedEx today. It was my first time ordering bulk crickets off the internet, and I naively assumed that they would be in like, a bag or some other contraption to facilitate easy transfer to another container.They were not. Instead of being in a bag, the crickets were loose inside of the cardboard box - so as soon as he cut the tape and lted the lid, there were crickets everywhere.  Christopher, who lives in Red Lake Falls, continued: I didnt have time to deal with cricket logistics, so I put the tape back on the box and then I put the box in the upstairs bathroom, the only semi-contained place in the house where I knew the kids and the cats and dogs wouldnt be able to get at the box and tear it open and unleash  hungry crickets into our warm, semi-humid environment. But his plan didnt work as well as hed hoped and about  minutes later he heard his we, Briana, complaining about goddamn crickets. The dad assumed maybe one or two insects had escaped when he opened the box - so he ignored it and continued working. This was a mistake, he later admitted.  He went on to explain: Im trying to wrap up a story but I keep hearing cricket-related exclamations coming from the kichen... Eventually I get up to investigate. By this point there were crickets all over the kitchen and when he checked the bathroom he found that the room was also covered in the bugs. Crickets on the floor. Crickets on the walls. Crickets in the sink. Crickets in the toilet. Thinking fast, Christopher headed out to the shedto find the familys spare fish tank.  He then claims to have spent a good  minutes collecting crickets from the bathroom and around the house. Describing the experience, he said it was like the worlds s***tiest game of Pokemon. He added: But here we are roughly  hours after the initial catastrophe, and stray crickets are still turning up in odd places. His story prompted some brilliant responses on social media. One person wrote: I actually called my mom and read this whole tweet stream to her through my tears. Thanks for sharing. Made my weekend, and perhaps new year. Another commented: Same thing happened to me, except I opened the box to , dead crickets and was totally bummed, only to find out the next morning that they hibrernate.

I enjoyed them. Do you mindI swing by tomorrow at pm to collect the money  Things instantly take a weird turn as the mum replies: I wasnt aware payment was involved. You got free ice cream and a day of fun... Im sorry for the misinterpreation. Confused, the babysitter quickly reminds her that they had already discussed a payment of an hour before she agreed to watch the kids, then sends images of their previous conversation to prove it.

The interactive graphic charts December  parties from the very first firework in Samoa until the dawn of  on the US atolls of Baker and Howland Islands. And the timings mean die-hard revellers could even cram in the worlds first and last New Years Eve parties - but onlytheyre willing to fly  miles. Analytics experts at Esri UK have put together the map, plotting the course of s arrival in Greenwich Mean Time .  Christmas Island and Samoa are the first to see in the new year, with their clocks hitting midnight at am GMT on Monday. From there, New Zealand will welcome  from am GMT before most of Australia joins the party two hours later. China says goodbye to  from pm GMT, with spectacular firework displays expected in Beijing and Hong Kong.   New Delhi will be marking the event from .pm GMT, with Moscow joining at pm. And big European cities like Madrid, Paris and Rome will see midnight pass a full hour before the Brits. Americans, meanwhile, have to wait until at least am GMT before they can celebrate in earnest.   And the final flourish will be on outlying islands around the US like Baker and Howland at pm GMT, although, since no one lives there, it is likely to go unheralded. Jessica Houghton, technical research consultant at Esri UK, explained: The New Year’s Eve map is a fun way of helping explain GMT and shows how people around the globe will be celebrating and welcoming in  at dferent times. “Esri’s mapping and analytics software is currently used by millions of people around the world to visualise data using interactive maps, providing them with key insights and the ability to make the right decision first time.   And Professor Charles Withers, Geographer Royal for Scotland, said it was certainly possible to see in the New Year twice thanks to the worlds dferent time zones. He said: Because of the ision of the world into time zones, and our measurement of the world in terms of longitude, there is a line,  degrees longitude from Greenwich – the International Date Line or ‘line of demarcation’ – where consecutive days and dates meet.   The line has no legal status and, in fact, does not run as a straight line, north to south at  degrees from Greenwich, but curves in and out to reflect dferent countries’ interests.But it is possible to cross it and ‘gain’ a day – or cross in the other direction and so ‘lose’ a day.And yes, because this is so, you could, with the help of appropriate transport, have more than one New Year’s party.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/Sbro_Layla_Whitlam_Calendars_Tayport-2-846x564.jpg ","title":"animal lover layla made sure citys needy dogs were not forgotten at christmas","story":"A kind-hearted schoolgirl produced her own calendars to raise money for her local dog shelter.Layla Whitlam, , from Tayport, has taken an interest in helping animals in need and decided to go the extra mile over the festive period.She painted dog calendars, with all the money raised going towards buying goods for Dundee’s Brown Street Kennels.Layla’s mum Ashley, , a catering assistant, said: “She loves animals but unfortunately we’re pretty full at home.“We have eight guinea pigs, a hamster, two turtles, a dog and a cat.“For the last couple of years, we’ve been going along to Brown Street Kennels at Christmas because it’s the one nearest to us.

It’s a step back in the right direction and, hopefully, be a good point in the end.“Livingston’s gameplan was to go direct and put balls into the box to make things hard for us but I felt we stood up to it very well, I can’t think of them having a clear chance.“A draw was probably a fair result but I felt we were the better team.Hopefully, it’s a good point come the end of the season.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5beea446b01d4-e1542367936504-809x564.jpg ","title":"former dundee favourite gary harkins moves to partick thistle and could face united this weekend","story":"Two former Dundee midfielders have completed moves to Championship outfits.Dens cult hero Gary Harkins left Queen of the South this week and has signed up for a second spell at Partick Thistle.Jags boss Gary Caldwell has secured the -year-old on an -month deal and he’s now expected to make his debut against old rivals Dundee United at Tannadice on Saturday.Also on the move is Nicky Low, who left Derry City at the end of the Irish season in November.

It was ‘who do you think it’s going to be  I’ve heard this or that’ and stuff like that.“I think with regards to the owners or the chairman, we don’t really see them that much on a day-to-day basis.“And the club has been running along smoothly, so it was not something we were speaking about too much.“There was a lot of talk about it in the week or so leading up to the takeover being confirmed last week, so it was mentioned but not all that much to be honest.”Now, though, Booth is keen to see just how much Minnesota-based Ogren is going to give manager Robbie Neilson to further strengthen the squad for the second half of the season.“January and the transfer window is coming and it will be interesting what happens, though it’s hard to say what will. We’ll get a view of the chairman’s ambition then and see what he does.“For us, Mike Martinwas a great guy but we didn’t see him too much and it will be the same with the new owner. We’ll talk about it a little bit but not too much and we just concentrate on the games coming up.”That focus on games made Booth well aware of the importance of United getting a win when Falkirk visited last Saturday.He believes the three points taken from that - victory were vital.“Obviously we’d not won in three games, so it was vital to get back to winning ways, especially at home.“Our last home performance against Ayr was disappointing, so it was huge to get the three points and I thought we played well and created a load of chances.“We probably should have been at least - up by the time injury time came and we gave away the penalty they scored from.“We were a bit slack for it and it meant the last few minutes were kind of ‘oh no’, but we managed to hold out pretty comfortably in the end and deserved the win.“It should have been dead and buried before that and I was really disappointed at not getting the clean sheet because we had defended really well during the game.“Overall, it was a good performance and a good win. We created good openings and we need to learn from that and put away more chances when we’re creating them like we did.”Booth also believes it was important United got back to imposing their passing game on teams again, just as they’d done in the draw at Inverness a week earlier.“That’s two good performances in a row. Four points from a home game against Falkirk and a trip to Inverness is not a bad .“We had a little dip and the Ayr United game took us by shock.“We didn’t really recover the week after down at Morton where it was a pretty poor performance but we feel back on track and long may it continue.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c23494787682.jpg ","title":"wasted emergency services spent a fortnight attending hoax calls","story":"Tayside#s emergency fire and ambulance crews have spent nearly a fortnight responding to hoax calls over the past four years, the Tele can reveal.Hundreds of calls have been made to both services which have led to a turn-out of staff, only for them to find it was malicious.Firefighters have spent more than , minutes – a total of  hours or more than  days – responding to such incidents since -.The majority of those calls involved fire alarms being activated deliberately, but they have also attended  reports about dangerous buildings, crashes and people in distress.In -, crews spent more time attending hoax calls than any of the previous two years, at more than , minutes.Between April and November this year, the figure stood at , minutes.Terry Whyte, local representative for the Fire Brigades Union , said crews are working hard to inform children about the implications of making   calls.He said: “The FBU has been working with the fire and rescue service to try to drive this down.“It’s down to education, such as going into schools and teaching kids about how important it is.“Our officers could be tied up with something  when there is a much more serious incident going on where.“We are constantly out speaking to kids about the dangers of making these kind of calls.“If there’s a specic area that we’re getting these calls from, then we’ll go out to it.“We certainly won’t be slowing down in trying to stop it happening for good.”Meanwhile, paramedics in Tayside have also been on the receiving end of malicious calls – most frequently in Dundee.Ambulance staff in the city have spent a total of , minutes responding to hoax calls since - – equal to about  hours, or more than two days. vw, px\"  And figures suggest that - is on track to be the worst year of the last four – with more than  minutes already spent on hoax incidents since April, more than the whole of - and just short of figures from - or -.Callers have ly reported patients having breathing problems, traumatic injuries, chest pains, burns, drowning and even stabbing or gunshot wounds, during their malicious calls.A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said: “Anyone who calls  without a genuine need is potentially putting lives at risk by tying up valuable resources that could be needed for a le-threatening call.“When appropriate, malicious or nuisance callers are reported to the police.“However, in many cases, the call is a result of a social issue rather than malice and the patient may still need assistance.“In these cases, the relevant agencies are advised so appropriate care can be provided.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We condemn hoax calls to our emergency services.

Travellers will have more options for onward connections.Inverness Airport general manager Graeme Bell said: \"The route has always been very popular with European travellers. In addition the long-haul market is hugely important and connecting through Amsterdam opens up these international destinations, allowing people to travel to and from Inverness on one ticket. This is a real vote of confidence in Inverness Airport.\"General manager for Air France-KLM UK, Benedicte Duval, said: \"The enhanced schedule will provide the local Highland community with more choice and even better connection times during what is the key holiday season. The additional flight adds  per cent more seats when compared with the same period last year, making this beautul region more accessible for international tourists.\"Stewart Nicol, chief executive of Inverness Chamber of Commerce, called the announcement \"fantastic\" and added: \"It is a real endorsement of what the route has been doing for KLM and an indication of how hard the guys at Inverness Airport have been working with the airlines to develop routes.\"Regarding the possibility of the third flight becoming permanent he added: \"The pattern in the past with a number of airlines is to test the market like this, and in the past it has led on to the development of actual routes that have been to the benefit of Inverness and the region.\"Graeme Ambrose, chief executive of the VisitInvernessLochNess business improvement district said: \"This is just another great bonus, more good news in terms of what Inverness Airport has been achieving over the past few months with other flights to the north. They are on a roll.\"Inverness economist Tony Mackay said he hoped Brexit would not prove a stumbling block.\"There has been a big increase in European visitor numbers to Inverness and the Highlands because of the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"KLM have obviously benefited from that. I also believe that many business passengers to or from overseas prefer to fly via Amsterdam rather than Heathrow or Luton.\"One note of caution, however, is the possible adverse impact of Brexit once it takes effect.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

For myself, it has two principal components.The first is light. Most societies had and have a celebration of light at the darkest time of the year. It is a pattern followed by most of the world#s great religions.The religious reference is not only to the physical darkness of the sun being below the equator, but also the psychological darkness caused by uncertainty, loss, suffering of the body or the mind, broken relationships and the brokenness of many lives.By allowing the light of Christ to shine into our lives and bring comfort, guidance, courage, strength, we can change direction, start again and have cause for celebration.The second aspect is of birth. It really does not matter where or when Jesus was born. As Paul writes: #Jesus was born of a woman#, as we all were. The birth of a child, the gt of le, with all the potential each child has to become fully themselves.Jesus#s birth was no more or no less important to Mary and toThis time of year gives us the opportunity to celebrate le and perhaps, as the years pass and we look back, to reflect on how we have used our gts and talents.Is the world a better place because I we have walked this way  Is the world a better place because the Christ has walked this way If you are together as family, be happy together. Le is too valuable to spoil a celebration. If you are alone, I trust there are folk around you who will share with you.Whoever you are, may the light and the love of Christ#s coming bless you as you journey.PIC:Reverend Dr Roderick Campbell. _aRevCampbellAs isional commander, I sincerely hope this very special time of year is one that is fun-filled, enjoyed by all, and everyone is kept safe.It’s also a time for reflection.

Argyll is stunning in the summer months when the sun shines but even as the nights get longer and the days colder there is still so much to enjoy from our glittering winter landscapes to the warmth of our many whiskies.When I look back over the past  months at le in Argyll and Bute, there is one thing that really stands out – the tremendous sense of community spirit, pride and positivity that’s sweeping through our communities of late.We have our challenges to face – that’s inescapable. But over the past year in particular I’ve been so encouraged to see the determination of local people to rise above those challenges and make sure that local le is as vibrant and successful as possible.  We’re all spreading the word that Argyll and Bute really is a great place to live, work, visit and do business – all year round.Wherever you are in Argyll and Bute, I hope you enjoy the festive season and that  brings you what you need. A Happy New Year to you all.PIC:Councillor Aileen Morton. no_aAileen-MortonMay I begin by wishing each of you a peaceful New Year.I think it is important that we take a bit of time  out of time to appreciate what we have but also to think of those less fortunate than ourselves andpossible, resolve to do something that will make a dference to someone’s le this festive season.Shamefully, despite the United Kingdom being the sixth largest economy in the world, more and more of our friends, neighbours and colleagues here in Argyll and Bute will have to rely on food banks and charities to get them through the season.It beggars belief that in , increasing numbers of mums, dads, children, pensioners, those in low-paid work, people seeking work, those living with mental health issues or a disability, have gone hungry and more and more children had nothing to unwrap on Christmas morning.And without the generosity of the people of Argyll and Bute and the wonderful work being done by an army of volunteers, the situation would be so much worse. And each of us owes these volunteers a huge thank you for the work they do.So please,you can afford it, please donate a little something extra to your local food bank this week.As my dad would often say: #There, but for the grace of God, go I.#PIC:Brendan O#Hara MP. no_aBrendanOHaraLiving as we are through the most dficult and disturbing of times it is important for all of us # and especially politicians # to realise that there are more important things than partisan headlines, parliamentary debates and public disagreements.Family, health, the company of friends, our homes and the wonderful environment of Argyll and Bute that we are lucky enough to live in are all things which we should treasure and celebrate. Those who lack them or who through illness or loneliness or despair cannot, for a time, appreciate them need our special thoughts particularly during the festive season.As your local MSP, working alongside my constituency staff, I have tried to help all of those who have contacted me during the year for whatever reason. That is my first duty and I am glad to do it. We won’t always agree on everything but we can agree, I am sure, that by showing solidarity, mutual support and kindness we can find the best way to live together here in Argyll and Bute, in Scotland, across these islands, in Europe and globally.We cannot know what lies ahead and the uncertainty of Brexit casts a long shadow locally and nationally at present. But this is a time to be hopeful so with hope in my heart for Argyll and Bute and our country I am delighted to wish everyone in the constituency and beyond a great and very Merry Christmas and a peaceful and prosperous New Year.PIC:Michael Russell MSP. _ahustings_russellIt’s always lovely to feel and see things changing as Christmas gets closer – evensome might say the whole festive season gets started a little too early these days.Argyll and Bute looks festive and colourful, and a lot of credit must go to the community groups who take such great pride in putting on festive events and leading the charge when it comes to Christmas lights and decorations in their towns. It all helps to add to the feeling that Christmas is a joyous time that should be filled with family, friends, fun and festivities.Christmas means a lot of dferent things to dferent people, and I hope that whatever is most important to you this festive season plays a big part in your celebrations.And once Christmas has come and gone, the New Year allows us all the chance to look forward to the next  months.I would encourage everyone to take a moment to think about those in our communities who may not find this time of year as much fun as others, for whatever reason.Happy New Year to you all.PIC:Provost Len Scoullar. no_aLenScoullar"},{"url":null,"title":"country christmas dance craic in ardrishaig","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Societyheld its Christmas party dance in Ardrishaig Hall on Monday December .Visitors from Tarbert, Kilmelford and Strachur were welcomed and a great evening was had by everyone, dancing to the wonderful accordion music of Ian Muir.A delicious buffet supper was served in the interval and Santa took time out from his busy schedule to put in an appearance and distribute presents, much to the delight of the youngest dancer, two-year-old Erica McKee.The programme featured dances connected with one of the founders of the RSCDS, Ysobel Stewart, and MC Mike Murray entertained the audience between dances with snippets of information about Mrs Stewart#s le and connections with Argyll.Dancing resumes after the holidays on Monday January .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion.

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

It is now costing the country millions ndash it isinexcusable and people wonrsquot be fooled.And Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: ldquoNever has it been clearer that our Government is selling us down the river over Brexit.ldquoA firm that has never run a ferry service before has been awarded a multimillion-pound contract and they donrsquot even have any ships.ldquoWe know our ports arenrsquot ready for a no-deal disaster, but is hiring a firm thatrsquos never dealt with this kind of thing before really going to help This idea should have been sunk before it saw the light of day.A Department for Transport spokesman added:ldquoThis contract was awarded in the full knowledge that Seaborne Freight is a new shipping provider, and that the extra capacity and vessels would be provided as part of its first services.ldquoAs with all contracts, we carefully vetted the companyrsquos commercial, technical and financial position in detail before making the award..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Questions over Brexit ferry contract for company with no ships"},{"url":null,"title":"dunavertys lotto winners","story":"Two winners: Willie MacMillan and Keith Crawford receive £ each.The next draw for a jackpot of £ will be on Sunday.Tickets available from club steward, committee members, Muneroy Tearoom and Burnside bar."},{"url":null,"title":"sloggers set for sandy sprint","story":"The K out and back run for athletes aged  and over costs just £ to enter and is usually blessed with fine weather."},{"url":null,"title":"letter think of shop workers at christmas","story":"I want to gently remind your readers to remember that shopworkers are people as well.They will be working really hard to make your shopping experience as stress-free and enjoyable as possible.A recent Usdaw survey shows that every minute of every day another shop worker is verbally abused, threatened with violence or physically attacked.Shop workers tell us that incidents are more frequent throughout the Christmas and New Year period when shops are busier, customers can be stressed and are more likely to take out their frustration on staff.Talking to our members who work in retail, I know that verbal abuse cuts deep.Many will go home after a sht upset about an unpleasant incident that took place at work that day and worried that it will happen to them again.That is why Usdaw, the shop workers’ union, is running a Respect for Shopworkers campaign, asking customers to ‘Keep your Cool at Christmas’.It’s a simple message, but remembering that shop workers are working extra hard at this time and treating them with respect will mean that everyone can have a happier Christmas.Paddy Lillis,General secretary,Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers."},{"url":null,"title":"golf lotto results 2","story":"The winning numbers were ,  and .The winning numbers in Monday#s draw, for a jackpot of £, were: ,  and .

curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single curriculum anda single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The decision to push ahead with the plans came despite a public consultation which found only  per cent of those who took

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-ministers-book-of-poetry-inspired-by-the-bible","story":"The Rev Jock Stein, along with we Margaret, was joint locum minister at Cockenzie Old Parish Church before stepping down in .Originally he started writing one poem for each of the  books in the Bible and then, encouraged by friends, expanded his poetic project further.He said: ldquoThey said to me it was daft just to approach it that way as it would be too complicated and folk might not understand it, so it was suggested I focus on people and their stories, which is why From Cosmos to Canaan is the first of many volumes.ldquoIn it I examine key issues and use poetry to give a new slant on it.

Instead, what the quietly inspirational Suzuki served up was a loose, shape-shting, improvised journey into sound, his shamanic chanting coaxing his willing band down gloriously unpredictable musical avenues.

Before bringing its Budget back to Parliament, the SNP must think again.One of the social security levers provided to Holyrood after the independence referendum was the ability to \"top up\" reserved benefits.Ahead of Finance Secretary Derek Mackayrsquos draft Budget in December, a coalition of academics, charities and anti-poverty groups called on the minority SNP administration to boost child benefit by pound.In a separate letter to Mackay, senior church figures also demanded the Government act with ldquogreater urgency by backing the same policy.The benefit, which is taxable for some high-earning families, is currently worth pound. a week for the eldest child and pound. for additional children. A pound-a-week rise for each child has been costed at around pound million.However, Mackay snubbed the calls and the Government is sticking with its plan of introducing an ldquoincome supplement by , which could be after the next Holyrood election.New figures, produced by Scottish Labour, show that over half-a-million families would receive a boostthe policy was introduced next year.The statistics also reveal that , families with more than one child would see their income topped up by at least pound a year.Around , families with two children would receive the pound-plus rise, as would , family units with three children, and over , families with four or more kids.In Glasgow, nearly , families fit into this category, while the figure for central Scotland is closer to ,.Critics of the proposal believe topping up the benefit, first introduced in , is an inefficient way of lting some of the , children out of poverty.At First Ministerrsquos Questions earlier this year Nicola Sturgeon said the policy would result in a ldquodrop in child poverty of ldquojust two percentage points, adding: ldquoI am not saying that that is insignicant, but we are committed to introducing an income supplement, and in doing so we must ensure that the money that is invested in it has maximum effectiveness in tackling child poverty.She also said that pound out of every pound would go to families who are not living in poverty.Children are deemed to be living in povertythey are in households with less than  per cent of median household income.Leonard told this newspaper: ldquoOur communities are being held back by austerity. The fact that one-in-four children in Scotland are spending Christmas living in poverty is nothing short of a national outrage. Children in poverty cannot wait for help, they need it now. Before bringing its budget back to Parliament the SNP must think again.ldquoLabourrsquos plan to top-up Child Benefit by pound per week will mean more than quarter of a million families across Scotland will be pound better off.\"John Dickie, chair of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said: \"There is no question that families need an immediate boost to their incomes to help tackle the devastating hardship too many children are facing. The Scottish Governments commitment to an income supplement by  is hugely welcome, but families who are struggling to put food on the table and pay the bills now really canrsquot wait that long.ldquoA pound top up to Child Benefit would be one way of lting thousands of children out of poverty and protecting many more from the damage that poverty wreaks.\"Rt Rev Susan Brown, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, said: ldquoIt is a political, social and moral imperative that we act now to effect change for the good.ldquoThe Church of Scotland stands alongside people of all faith traditions, and none, in the move towards fairness for all our children.Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: ldquoScotland is the only part of the UK to have ambitious targets to reduce, and ultimately eradicate child poverty.ldquoWe are developing a new income supplement to provide additional financial support to families who need it most, as research shows topping up Child Benefit, which remains reserved to the UK Government, is not the most efficient or effective way to lt children out of poverty, nor would it be quick or simple.ldquoOur Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan outlines action to reduce child poverty, including investing poundm in intensive employment support for parents, introducing our new Financial Health Check service and increasing school clothing grants.

As it comes to a close, we ask young activists, school students and youth campaigners what their hopes and fears are for the year ahead.If they could wave a magic wand, what would they make change  And what about the world around them worries them most Holly Gillibrand, \"Climate change is what concerns me most about the world. My family have been worried about climate change, but itrsquos only started dawning on me in the last few years that itrsquos really serious and that we need to do something about it.We stopped eating meat because thatrsquos bad for the environment and we try to limit the amount of times we go in the car. We use green energy and wersquore going to start growing our own vegetables.A couple of weeks ago I went into Fort William town centre, and I talked to local cafes about using plastic straws because to make plastic you use fossil fuels. We recently had a meeting because wersquore trying to create a Fort William Extinction Rebellion group so we can do some action in .I think, politically, there just needs to be much more action, because politicians and leaders are having all these climate talks but nothing is actually happening. We could tax CO, we could tax meat to encourage more sustainable and ethical eating, but that isnrsquot happening. The politicians and the government need to be doing much more.Irsquove been reading about it and the UK government is planning to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions by  per cent by , which is not enough. There need to be zero greenhouse gas emissions by  worldwide.There are still people in my class who donrsquot think that climate change exists. I think that one thing that needs to happen in  is for schools to start educating young people on climate change. There needs to be more awareness. In one of my classes at high school we had some lessons on the global goals and it was depressing that climate action is number  when it should be number one.Irsquove seen quite a few of the talks by Greta Thunberg [the teenage activist who has inspired a generation with her climate strikes] and, in fact, after the holidays Irsquom going to start climate striking ndash only for an hour every Friday. Irsquom just going to sit outside school for an hour in the morning. Irsquom trying to get other people involved but on February  therersquos going to be a UK-wide school strike.Parisa Shirazi, I work for an MP, and I come at this question from what Irsquove seen in casework. There are a lot of things which make you very angry.When yoursquore working in an MPrsquos office a lot of things that you deal with are to do with social security and immigration cases and what I see day in and day out is that perfectly ordinary, good people are being treated with a hell of a lot of scepticism. We see people whose benefits are being cut, people who are very ill being dragged in for disability assessments, people who are just applying for visiting visas for their familythey have a new baby in the UK and just facing blanket refusals.So what I would like to see I less cynicism towards certain groups of people. There is a lot of scepticism towards people in the benefits system. There seems to be a lack of appreciation of the fact that the system is paid into by everyone and itrsquos thereanyone needs it. Thatrsquos what the welfare state is for ndash itrsquos not to demonise a certain group of people.Irsquove not always been political. I grew up in Northern Ireland, apathetic towards politics. I moved away when I was , studied in Durham and did my masters in Edinburgh.I feel exhausted by Brexit. I feel like it was an enormous amount of upheaval for no gain. It just fills me with despair. Becauseyou study a law degree, as I did, you hear about things like disability rights and other rights that were brought about by being part of the EU.Sanna Aziz, \"I do a lot of campaigning around race equality. What I would like to see in  is a lot more research into the racial wage gap. There is not enough prominent research into what it is like for women of colour to be in the workplace and get paid so little compared to their white or male counterparts. I would also like to see some actual work being done in that area, in trying to make that equality, some sort of initiatives so therersquos a whole government drive towards that goal.Last year I went to the United States on an exchange set up in Jo Coxrsquos memory. It was inspiring. We visited so many dferent organisations. We went just after Trump was elected and they were talking about the amount of hate crime that was spiked then in the US. The organisations there felt like they were getting pushed back, but they were still pushing forward. They were saying no matter what happens just keep pushing forward because eventually you will make change.What drives me is that when I was a kid, I experienced a lot of racially based bullying. I used to get so upset about it, but when I was older and in high school before I left, I talked to the kid and I asked him why and he didnrsquot have a proper reason for why.From then I realised a lot of it is done out of ignorance, so from then on I tried to prevent people being as ignorant, and make them come to terms with the damage they can do when theyrsquore being racist or homophobic.Irsquom studying international politics at Stirling University. A large part of me is really nervous to go into the jobs market. But again, Irsquom hopeful. Irsquom just hopeful that everything will work out and my generation will be able to maybe not fix things, but improve them.I want to see more consideration for what iniduals experience on a day-to-day basis when theyrsquore of colour. Because some days itrsquos fine, but other days you can be walking down the street and you get spat at or given dirty looks or something. Those things are not severe enough for people to say itrsquos a hate crime. Itrsquos just a day to day stigma around people of colour that I want us to get rid of. I know it wonrsquot happen overnight. It probably wonrsquot happen in the next ten years but Irsquom hopeful.Hannah Brisbane, ldquoIn  I would like to see more girls having more confidence and speaking out on issues that matter to them and being invited into important discussions. With Girl Guiding Scotland next year wersquore developing a youth forum and my role with them is helping lead to that. Irsquom really excited to give our members a space to speak out on issues that effect girls and young women.Irsquove had lots of opportunities over the past four years. Irsquove given evidence at the Scottish Parliament in committees and met MPs and MSPs. So I definitely feel that Irsquove been listened to and Irsquom keen to help other girls have that same experience. Irsquove done a lot of work on sexual harassment and in particular harassment in schools.Research we did a few years ago found that two-thirds of girls had experienced some sort of harassment in school. Thatrsquos unacceptable and we had the opportunity to bring that evidence to the Scottish Parliament and do some work with them on how we can change things, for instance develop Personal and Social Education.We started that work before the Weinstein scandal came out. Movements like MeToo and TimesUp have forced people to take these issues more seriously.Brexit makes the year ahead really uncertain. I voted Remain and Irsquom definitely worried about losing certain rights. For instance I was on an Erasmus exchange year last year and after school I worked for a year to save up to go travelling around Europe. I do French and politics at Edinburgh University, so I feel that possibilities from that might be more limited. Irsquod hope that those rights that we had will remain but no one knows what will happenNicola Sturgeon is probably one of my political heroes. I remember looking up to her even when she was just Health Secretary and thinking that women can be a force to be reckoned with in politics.Joe Hesmondhalgh, \"My biggest concern is climate change and the current climate crisis. Itrsquos always been on my radar, but the UN report that came out in September really brought it to my attention. It said we had twelve years to stop the worst effects of the potential climate crisis and that terried me. What is also terrying to me is the lack of urgency from our government and powerful institutions and the media.I got involved in Extinction Rebellion, a climate action group that uses non-violent, disruptive methods to get our voices heard, in November. I helped set up the Extinction Rebellion Glasgow group but also the Extinction Rebellion Glasgow University group and Irsquove been involved in two direct actions so far. Irsquom willing to be arrested for this because itrsquos the most important thing there is.When I think of all of the issues I care about, climate change will make all of them worse. I really care about homelessness ndash it will make that worse. I really care about human rights ndash it will make that worse. I really am willing to get arrested for it. I think a lot of other people are too.Brexit is obviously an issue which is going to have a big impact on my le, but when therersquos such a massive, global crisis looming, it almost feels like itrsquos a distraction. Wersquove got twelve years to save the planet and the Brexit negotiations will probably take that long to wrap. When you see the massive resources that are being put into Brexit negotiations and preparations fortherersquos a No Deal, it just seems crazy. We could be putting all those resources into averting climate change.What Irsquod like to see, in , is the Extinction Rebellion key demands happen. A commitment to zero carbon emissions by  would be a step in the right direction from the UK government. As a rich country, our government and us, as the public, have to take the lead in trying to avert the climate breakdown. I think creating fair climate policy is also a democratic issue.This is the first time Irsquove ever got involved in any direct action ndash for two reasons. Firstly, the UN climate change report had an impact on me and, secondly, I think Extinction Rebellion feels genuinely dferent. It feels like wersquove been signing petitions and writing to MPs for years and this is fresh and new and it exciting. Wersquove tried all the non-disruptive methods. I think itrsquos time to try disruptive methods.For a while I wasnrsquot optimistic about the future. Hearing, over the years, all the evidence and reports about climate change does make you cynical and it makes you want to switch off, but I think, after joining Extinction Rebellion and other groups, Irsquove stopped feeling miserable or cynical. I felt the same about homelessness but then I started volunteering at Shelter. I think working together with other people really does make you feel better about it. I think the best way to not feel miserable about these things is to do something about it alongside other people.\"Callum Lynch, \" is the year that Scotland has the opportunity to fundamentally reshape what a childhood can be for people who are or have grown up in care. I went into care when I was  and while that meant I was saved from the neglect that I lived in, it also meant spending the rest of my childhood surrounded by legal processes and professionalism.I had staff, not parents. I lived in a unit, not a home. I was physically restrained by the people who looked after me when it was deemed I wasnrsquot being compliant. I was part of routine conversations about whether it was a good idea for me to live in the same place as my brother, even though he was the only person who understood my le.I hear versions of this still,  years on, compounded by the fact that young people still donrsquot have the right to independent advocacy in legal meetings where enormous decisions are made about their le. Hope has, for many, felt like something hard to find in . I have felt like a bit of an anomaly this year because I have relished political conversations.Having spent the year campaigning and speaking to politicians from every party, I know that while there are fundamental disagreements about our constitutional make-up, there is political will to do something dferent for care experienced people. I believe that our politicians want something revolutionary to happen for those are or have been looked after by the state. \"Erin McAuley, ldquoA lot of our lives are very precarious. Although therersquos a lot more opportunity therersquos little security or stability. A lot of the jobs that young people are facing are insecure or are short-term contracts or are not well paid in comparison to the standard of living.It seems to be that therersquos a whole chunk of young people in Britain who are stuck in this precarious cycle of high rents and insecure work, low pay. That includes students. Irsquove qualied as a teacher recently, but to sustain myself at uni Irsquove worked all my four years. Irsquom in retail now, on a short-term contract.Itrsquos not unusual for young people to be in and out of short-term contracts. And something that frustrates me in work is that Irsquom doing exactly the same work as maybe my colleague younger than me or my colleague older than me, but wersquore all getting a dferent pay based on our age. Thatrsquos something that shouldnrsquot be happening.Irsquom chair of the Unite Youth Committee. Within that committee our three big things are the pay disparity among young people, mental health and rent. If I could wave a wand in , I would have something done about the price of housing, whether thatrsquos through rent caps or more social housing. But also I would change the world of work, and not have any zero-hour contracts and have wages that people feel they can sustain themselves on.Mental health is another thing that I would want to solve. There is a mental ill health epidemic and no wonder, given wersquove got an insecure job market, and insecure housing, plus so much more pressure on young people, with Instagram and twitter, to feel validated.Irsquove always campaigned for mental health services, partly because of my own experiences. I went to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Servicewhen I was  but then I got moved straight to the adult service because there was not a young adult service, and it was just a long waiting list. My magic wand for Scotland for mental health would be to bring in a - service.Bryn Evans, ldquoThe thing I most worry about to do with the world right now is Brexit. When the referendum happened, I was hopeful that the vote would go towards Remain so when it got announced that we were going to leave, it shocked me.A few of my friends are from a iety of dferent European countries and they are not scared but worried for their future in this country. I think some are just going to leave Scotland and not come back.The two things I would most hope to happen in  are Brexit not happening or Trump being put out of power."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-calls-for-end-to-chummy-appointments-to-house-of-lords","story":"Spokesman Tommy Sheppard said it was \"inexcusable\" that successive governments had continued to make \"chummy political appointments\" to the Upper House of Parliament, at an annual cost to the taxpayer of pound, per peer.But a spokesman for the House of Lords said the overall number of members had in fact fallen by  over the course of the year to  and was on track to meet a target of .He said that the pound, figure was \"misleading\", as it represented the total Lords budget ided by the number of members, rather than reflecting the cost of each inidual peer to taxpayers.The  new members of the Lords in  included nine Conservatives, six crossbenchers, three from Labour and one from the Democratic Unionist Party as well as three bishops.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"questions-raised-over-plans-for-a-statue-in-memory-of-boxing-hero-benny-lynch","story":"This is the story of Benny Lynch but it is a story told many times about so many prominent men, one that raises questions with no easy answers.Benny Lynch is a hero son of Glasgow, known for being a champion of the people but all but ignored by the powers that be.A group of local campaigners are close to raising the money needed for a statue honouring him, to be erected in the Gorbals where he was born and raised.But Lynch had convictions for both child abuse and domestic abuse ndash so, particularly in the evolving #MeToo era, is a statue for Benny the right thing to do Lily Greenan, deputy director of Zero Tolerance, the charity working to end male violence against women, would say no. \"We understand that the community would like a statue of Benny Lynch as he is a local hero,\" she said.\"But we would strongly questionthis is the sort of local hero that we should be commemorating.\"He was convicted of two separate violent assaults on women and young girls.\"These actions, and the actions of all violent men, should not be excused or forgotten because they are or were talent sportsmen, popular politicians, or celebrities of any sort.\"Born in  to Irish parents in the Gorbals, Lynch died just  years later after a battle with chronic alcoholism that left him penniless and ultimately killed him.In the interim, he achieved boxing fame and fortune, becoming Scotlands first World Champion boxer and earning the adulation of Glasgow.Since , when the Statue for Benny campaign began, Bennys name has reentered the citys consciousness with great praise for the man described in an obituary in  as \"a veritable artist of the ring\".Film star Robert Carlyle is patron of the campaign, world champion boxer Jim Watt has lent his weight with fundraising support, and the citys former Lord Provost supported and praised the idea.The Statue for Benny campaign group also wants to set up a legacy project that would support people into sport, such as scholarships for talented youths.The Staffordshire Sentinel, Monday, March , . Headline: Scene in house described.\"Benny Lynch, former Flyweight Champion of the world, was fined pound at Hamilton today for assault.\"He was found Guilty of assaulting his we, -years-old sister-in-law, and three police constables.\"Mrs Lynch, who is , was informed that she was not obliged to testy against her husband, but elected to do so.\"She said she had been separated from him for six weeks, but ed to him on February .\"There was a dispute, and he went out, ing at night.\"When she was at home with her son and sister, Mrs Lynch said he came in \"screaming and shouting.\"\"He said to her, \"Get out of this house,\" and kicked her on the back.\"Saying, \"I will show you,\" Lynch, she declared, took the baby into the kitchen and held him over the gas stove, declaring: \"Ill gas him.\"\"When she attempted to get the baby, her husband kicked her on the legs.\"Mrs Lynch, who was under the stress of great emotion, stated that her husband put the baby on the floor and said: \"Look at him - hes dizzy.\"\"He then got her by the ears and hair and, when her sister tried to push him away, he turned and kicked the sister.\"Tears streamed down Mrs Lynchs face as she was cross-examined, and she was allowed to be seated.\"Lynch was drunk during the attack and, on arrival at the police station, said he couldnt remember what had happened.The Staffordshire Sentinel court report goes on to give the response of Lynchs defence lawyer, adding: \"[Lynch] had been making a real struggle to get fit again and felt ashamed that he, who could control himself in the ring better than anyone in the world, should be unable to control himself in his own home.\"[The lawyer] had been asked to contest strongly that Lynch, who loved his children, should be charged with the offence relating to the baby.\"The Statue for Benny campaign worked with Glasgow Le, which runs the citys museum and sport centres, to develop an exhibition about the boxer, which ended up travelling around the city for three years.Open Museum outreach assistant Kevin Kerrigan curated the display, which, after dozens of people came forward to donate Benny Lynch-related objects, ended up with a larger space in the Peoples Palace museum.\"The group wanted to tell a more positive story about Benny Lynch but I was always very clear that any exhibition would have to be balanced, it would have to contain both sides of the story,\" said Kerrigan.\"And it does go into quite a lot of detail about his alcoholism but next to that are the very positive things, his gloves and his trophies. It showcases his achievements.\"He achieved a lot in his career but his downfall was alcohol, that fed into his convictions - such as for drink driving.\"For Kerrigan, who is writing a book called Finding Benny, Lynch is a tragic, complex figure who the city should be proud of.\"There is no excuse for [domestic violence] but there can be causes,\" he adds.\"He has no convictions from before . If you want to look for a cause [drink] is one of them.\"Every single one of the newspaper reports mention that he was intoxicated. He was a flawed character.\"We are reframing things based on todays social norms and taking these incidents as standalone events then yes, we have to condemn them.\"But there wasnt the help then that there is now.\"Benny Lynch didnt get a second chance to recover or recant. All the problems in his le killed him. He died.\"Marsha Scott, chief executive of Scottish Womenrsquos Aid, would disagree. \"In the same breath as we often hear that there is no excuse for domestic abuse, we also hear that it is by and large the fault of alcohol, mental health, poverty, fame, or in historical cases ndash the product of a society with dferent morals to those we have now,\" she said.\"Those conveniently forgotten in this discourse are of course victim-survivors, the women who experience pain ndash physical and emotional ndash inflicted by abusers.\"In our view it is their strength and courage that merits celebrating, not those responsible for doing harm.\"There are records of Lynch trying to seek help for his alcoholism. He was sent to England for treatment and he would take the ferry to a monastery in Ireland to try and dry out.As Mr Kerrigan says, he \"shook it off\" but as soon as he was back in his former circles, the old problems would begin again.Under the influence of drink, Lynch racked up a slew of criminal convictions, including drink driving and child abuse.Liverpool Echo, Wednesday, October , . Headline: Benny Lynch Fined for Incident with girls in cinema\"Benny Lynch, the former world fly-weight boxing champion, was fined one guinea with the option of  days imprisonment at Govantoday for assaulting two girls, aged seven and , in a cinema.\"The circumstances are certainly odd. Lynch had gone to the cinema, to a matinee showing, and opted to sit next to a group of four very young girls.One of the children asked to move seats because she did not want to sit next to a strange man. Rather than moving, Lynch assaulted the girl.\"Lynch asked hershe was frightened and then put his arm round her neck.\"The girl began to cry, and an usherette informed the manager. Lynch then changed his seat.\"A solicitor for Lynch said the accused had had some drink.\"Men with drink were very fond of children, and a wrong construction had been put on the case.\"Lynch was only  when he died. His fame had been exceptional and his rapid decline even more so. His career was finished by  and he was dead in , dying of malnutrition induced respiratory failure.His is said to have made the equivalent of pound million in todays money but died penniless.Kerrigan said: \"Had he cleaned up his act and had the opportunity to make amends, to tell people that what he did was wrong and that he regretted it, who knows what he might have amounted to.\"Some people have the chance to redeem themselves and some dont.\"He clearly wanted to get past it. He was fighting it, he knew it was killing him and hurting him and his family.\"Whether Lynch would have recovered from his alcoholism is impossible to say, and what he would have done during recovery ndash make amends or not ndash is similarly unknowable.What we do know is that famous sportsmen are often given a free pass simply because they are talented, they generate money for their clubs and they have legions of supporters willing to overlook their abuses of power.What would a statue for Benny Lynch say about modern Glasgow \"We are erecting a statue to someone who has these dark sides and to an extent I would agree that theres a thing of celebrity where we bend light around certain people, no matter what they have done,\" Kerrigan adds.\"I think its a celebrity problem, rather than a sport problem. Film stars and actors, male and female, who have had problems with drugs and alcohol are still revered.\"The womens groups concerns are legitimate and they should be heard.\"Butyou look around the city at the statues and the artworks we have, they are not all squeaky clean characters. A lot of people from the past that we celebrate are very flawed characters and can we really judge them by modern standards \"Half of the artists in the citys collections have very colourful pasts and yet people revere them. What do we do about that \"Jimmy Boyle is revered as an artist and yet he spent time in Barlinnies Special Unit for much worse crimes ndash domestic abuse is a terrible crime ndash but this man committed murder.\"And people revere him as an artist. Do people not deserve a second chance \"For feminist groups, who have argued these points endlessly, the answer is straightforward. In Glasgow, where there are only four statues of women, a tribute to a known domestic abuser would be a backwards step.\"This yearrsquos unveiling of a statue of Mary Barbour brings the number of statues of women in Glasgow up to a grand total of four,\" a spokeswoman for Engender said.\"Despite this underrepresentation, the latest calls for a new statue for the city are for yet another man, this time commemorating boxer Benny Lynch.\"But as well as being held up by some as the one of the greatest flyweights in boxing history, Lynch was a known abuser convicted of assaulting his estranged we in , and of assaulting two young girls in a Glasgow cinema three years later.\"Yet read any of the ious articles about Lynch, or the calls for him to be commemorated in film or stone, and these facts will be mysteriously missing.\"References which do exist to his alcoholism and a troubled past only serve to perpetuate myths about domestic abuse, and gloss over Lynchrsquos violence against women.\"This is yet another example of a manrsquos sporting abilities erasing their abuse towards women.\"In the year where we saw #MeToo shine a light on the sexual harassment and assault being carried out by men in positions of power, we would hope that a man convicted of assault, no matter how good he was at winning in the ring, was not worthy of being commemorated in Scotlandrsquos cities.\"Bennys son, Bobby, said: \"My fathers story was one of a human being who defied the odds to become a world famous sportsman.\"It was in a time when there was no support for those in his position, there was a depression, two wars and alcohol was a blight on society.\"It wasnrsquot an excuse, but Benny achieved so much and brought so much joy in such a dark time.\"My mother recalled her time with him fondly and itrsquos such a shame he didnrsquot have the opportunity to pull himself out of his dark times as many with the right support and help can do.\"As a family, we have always hoped that his achievements are always at the forefront and itrsquos only now that we are really celebrating what he achieved.\"For many years the public poured over his sad last days and we hope to move on from that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"from-spacex-to-virgin-galactic-the-race-to-space-tourism","story":" saw a number of big names, including Sir Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos edge closer towards making space tourism a reality.So how did they progress in the last  months Virgin GalacticSir Richardrsquos Virgin Galactic carried out four successful tests in , after its original spaceship crashed in , killing one of the two pilots.In mid-December, the SpaceShipTwo rocket ship made it to the edge of space and back, reaching an altitude of ,ft - officially entering outer space according to US standards.SpaceShipTwo looking back on Spaceship Earth # pic ynrmKzzfmdash Virgin GalacticDecember , Hundreds watched as the space tourism plane took off and successfully landed back at the test centre in Calornia, which Sir Richard described as ldquoa relief.The aircraft carried two pilots, who were released by a carrier plane at ,ft , reaching a top speed of . times the speed of sound.SpaceXElon Muskrsquos SpaceX has its eyes set on the Moon for its space tourism project, with Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa scheduled to blast off in .The companyrsquos Big Falcon Rocket will take Mr Maezawa and six to eight artists, architects, designers and other creative people on the week-long journey around the Moon without a lunar landing ndash the first-ever private commercial trip of its kind.Hanging out with @yousuck before the @SpaceX moon mission announcement pic RTOwutzMtGmdash Elon MuskSeptember , Itrsquos not clear exactly how much the entrepreneur paid for the trip, though Mr Musk has said it is ldquoa lot of money.The Big Falcon Rocket is still under development and will be subject to a number of unmanned test launches before it takes any passengers.Blue OriginAnother name in the competition to take people into space is Amazon founder Jeff Bezosrsquos Blue Origin, which, in July, managed to shoot a capsule higher than it has done before.An inside look at the Flight Readiness Review leading up to a successful Mission  #nevergetsold pic FHbBjVJtmdash Blue OriginJuly , Named after Alan Shepard, the first American to go to space, the New Shepard rocket blasted off, climbing to an altitude of ,ftonce the booster had separated.ldquoWe will have to leave this planet, Mr Bezos said earlier this year.ldquoWersquore going to leave it, and itrsquos going to make this planet better.

This, after three years of everyone being told by David Cameron and everyone , including Theresa May, the Prime Minister for all her years in the job that it would be final. Not a single voice in any newspaper or anywhere  in the media, in all that time, has ever suggested that the democratic will of the people was only advisory, to be rejected by the House of Commonsit wished. These papers referred to have no credence, no validity, no force, for they have been over-ridden by the repeated statements of the referendum vote being sacrosanct by the current Prime Minister and her predecessor and accepted as such by everyone. Other papers have doubtless been omitted. That is how desperate the losers are to recover their position.Many have objected that the decision was wrong, but that it was the will of the people has been accepted for three years before the vote was ever held. These letters advancing the case of the referendum are the last-ditch defence of people who think they know better than the will of the people of the country. That arrogance has been demolished many times these last three years.We must leave and we must do so with honour. We must control our manner of leaving and not be bullied by the EU.

For a start, the gorge is ft deep which means the only way to get at the ldquonon-native species ndash Japanese knotweed and rhododendron ponticum ndash is to abseil down. The abseilers then have to identy where the plants are and spray them with weed-killer. Even the trust admits itrsquos pretty extreme stuff, but this is the point wersquore at now. In fact, the people working to eradicate ldquonon-native species see operations such as the one at Corrieshalloch as a ldquowar or ldquobattle against an ldquoinvasion or ldquoswarm. Those are the words they use. The defenders of our apparently native plants talk like theyrsquore on a battlefield or in a B-movie. And no-one laughs.However, I think now is the time to start questioning the orthodoxy,only to save us from more hyperbole. The narrative of the National Trust, and other organisations ndash backed by the Scottish and UK Governments ndash is that ldquonon-native species cost millions of pounds and that they must be eradicated to protect the ldquonative ones, even though their argument defies common sense, the history of the planet and the evolution of plants and animals. A fir tree or a grey squirrel doesnrsquot know where the border between two countries is, and nor should they, because the ision between native and non-native, like borders, is entirely man-made.The rhododendron ponticum that the National Trust wants to eradicate from Corrieshalloch is a good example. The plant has had all kinds of UKIP-style rhetoric thrown at it over the yearsand itrsquos mainly because, according to its detractors, it spreads fast and prevents other plants from growing. James Fenton, an ecologist who has worked for the National Trust, has even suggested thatwe took no action to control the plant and came back in a thousand years, the landscape of Scotland would be just one dark rhododendron forest.But could I stick up for the rhododendron ponticum, based on what the plant actually does  Itrsquos true that it thrives in certain types of soil, but it is no more or less likely to spread than ivy or bracken. The dference, of course, between bracken and rhododendron ponticum is that one is considered native and the other non-native even though rhododendron ponticum was certainly in this part of the world before the last Ice Age and was then reintroduced to Britain from seeds  years ago. How long does a plant have to be here before it is considered native The idea that rhododendron ponticum would spread ad infinitum is also flawed ndash thatrsquos just not how nature works. For example, the Americans used to get hysterical about the purple loosestre plant, which was accused of the same crime as rhododendron ponticum ndash reducing ersity ndash but the long-term evidence was dferent: there was a first wave of the plant, then it declined, and the natural ersity reasserted itself. With the exception of very small islands, this is what new species in an area do: they increase ersity rather than reduce it.The search for a scientic definition of ldquonon-native does not help either because there isnrsquot one. In fact, the whole idea of native and non-native was pretty much invented by Victorian botanists like Hewitt Watson, although no one has ever really been able to agree what the words mean. Should we go back to some kind of year zero ndashbut then how far back would you go  Andyou go too far back, you reach a point where the world was one great continent anyway and every plant and animal could spread and roam freely.Some attempts to define native and non-native are based on whether there has been human intervention, which is the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach, but this is also far from consistent. There is a widely-held view, for example, that grey squirrelsare non-native and should be culled, but why arenrsquot we seeking to eradicate other species that have been introduced such as the common pheasant  And what about the collared dove  Why spend money on measures to control the grey squirreland nothing on the collared dove, which has only been around in the UK since the s but is presumably competing with ldquonative birds for food It is this kind of inconsistency that makes a mockery of the whole native non-native ision and the National Trust for Scotlandrsquos operation at Corrieshalloch Gorge. Letrsquos deal with facts instead. Such as this one: plants and animals are not harmful just because they were introduced by humans, nor are they necessarily good for bioersity because they werenrsquot.And this fact: there are much greater environmental threats than the spread of ldquonon-native species, such as plastic and other types of waste, intensive farming, and industrial pollution - all of which are linked to the most dangerous native of all: humans.And then therersquos this fact: our ecology is changing all the time, animals and plants come and go, they thrive, fade, spread, fall back and rise again, and therersquos no reason why a erse and healthy environment of the future canrsquot include so-called non-native species. In fact, do you think that in a thousand years the petty definitions that are driving us to the bottom of gorges with weedkiller will matter  Our ecology will have moved on. There may not even be a Scotland or any other border by which to define our species. And the best thing about that  The plants and the animals will just get on with it anyway. They wonrsquot even notice."},{"url":null,"title":"aldi donates over 15k meals to charities","story":"Supermarket chain Aldi spread some festive cheer in the north east on Christmas Eve by donating , meals to ten charities.Aldi paired ten stores with local charities and food banks to make the most of quality unsold fresh food after stores closed on December .Around , meals were donated across the country, including , from Aldi’s stores in Scotland.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year honours list in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.ldquoWe had been in No.  Group Bomber Command, says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. ldquoThe whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. ldquoWe had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogetherhellip It required a lot of dferent techniques.ldquoAnd it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore yoursquod got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.ldquoThere developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.ldquoOn one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnrsquot just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.ldquoObviously we knew something was happening, Don says, ldquobecause we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werenrsquot aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. ldquoBefore that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: ldquoOne thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Donrsquos chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as ldquoPiccadilly Circus ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.ldquoWe were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place, he explains. ldquoIt was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. ldquoThey all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. ldquoHe released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one, says Don.ldquoThere was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnrsquot a great deal of resistance.It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crewmates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: ldquoThe Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.ldquoYou couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnrsquot want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  ldquoWell, everybodyrsquos scared ndash I donrsquot care what anyone says, he replies. ldquoIf yoursquore not scared you donrsquot perform, but itrsquos discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .ldquoThis is rude, I know, but itrsquos what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Itrsquos a matter of accepting whatrsquos going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job yoursquore supposed to do.ldquoItrsquos not a question of bravery. Irsquom very suspicious when people say, lsquoOh, yoursquore a brave man,rsquo or lsquoYouve got a lot of courage.rsquo You react to circumstances. Itrsquos a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.ldquoAnd I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when yoursquove got a unorm on and yoursquore acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.ldquoSo Irsquom very suspicious about lsquobraveryrsquo. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I donrsquot think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I donrsquot know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.DON can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.ldquoI fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhamrsquos Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating, Don says. ldquoHe had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a manrsquos wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.ldquoBut the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thatrsquos what I did.He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash ldquoI went to Arnhem five times during that debacle, says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until rsquo.He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crewmates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.ldquoAlthough our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand, says Don. ldquoIn  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnrsquot got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hersquod said, lsquoIrsquod love to see my old mate again.rsquo So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.ldquoNow you canrsquot explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Itrsquos what they call camaraderie. Irsquom still in touch with his family.As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash ldquotherersquos no doubt about that. But he adds: ldquoI regret to say I donrsquot think wersquove learned any lessons. I donrsquot think we should be doing what wersquore doing now [in Iraq].ldquoAs I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Itrsquos not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Itrsquos a sad reflection on society, I feel.ldquoWe ought to be very thankful that wersquore free, because thatrsquos what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnrsquot be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.ldquoIt was all for a cause. People may say, lsquoOh, thatrsquos patriotic nonsense.rsquo But it isnrsquot.This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OrsquoGroat Journal of June , .Monday  Dec  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118591.jpg","title":"Just the ticket for tackling debt","story":"Scottish Government ViewpointTHE Scottish Government has launched a People, Not Profit campaign to support the Scottish Credit Unions that play a vital role in helping people stay out of unmanageable debt.The campaign seeks to support the growth of the sector by raising awareness of credit unions and the services they offer to a wider and more erse audience.Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, launched the campaign.A new survey has revealed one in five Scots have not heard of a credit union.Currently, around , people across the country are part of a credit union some seven per cent of the population.The survey revealed also that only two-fthsof people questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union, and that one in four peoplewrongly believe they make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign will highlight credit unions are not-for-profit organisations providing loans and savings, and most people would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live.A new website has been launched to help people find out which credit union they could be a member of.Ms Campbell said: \"In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high-cost lenders.\"A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.\"Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union and I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.\"Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, who is a credit union member, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what the organisations are.* For more information, visit www.creditunions.scotMonday  Dec  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top.

This is a new permanent  scheme.Councillor Matthew Reiss, Thurso and Northwest Caithness, a former senior police officer with a particular interest in road safety, said: ldquoIf you have a lower speed limit, safety is improved ndash that is a fact.ldquoIf the local residents are happy with it then Irsquom very happy. With many parked cars on the streets there is always a chance of children walking out between them and not being seen. Slower cars will cut the chances of any potential accident.The civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, Wick and East Caithness, said research had shown a big reduction in collisions in built-up areas in towns and villages following the introduction of mph zones. They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Monday  Dec  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings.

It also opens on New Yearrsquos Day with a ldquowalk-off-the-hangover brunch and is promising more mouth-watering baklava from the Aleppo Bakers.Verity added: ldquoLocals of my age will remember how Mario Pagliari at his Merrythought Cafeacute used to always have his ice cream machine going over Christmas and New Year.

It’s not too late. We are already seeing recovery in some of our marine protected areas, but we don’t yet have a fully ing network of nature reserves at sea, where wildle has the opportunity to thrive.“That’s why we are looking forward to the third designation of marine conservation zones in  - with these we would have the potential to reverse current marine wildle declines.”Conservation successes include Dorset Wildle Trust’s work with local fishermen in Poole Harbour, who have both Marine Stewardship Council and Responsible Fishing Scheme accreditation for sustainable management of the sea, which is helping seahorses.As part of the scheme, Dorset fishermen have been reporting their marine sightings and have been finding the extremely rare short-snouted seahorse off the Purbeck coast.Seahorses face threats from trawlers which scour the seabed and from yacht anchors, so good management is essential to their survival, the Trust said.In Cornwall, the spiny lobster or crawfish is making a comeback from overfishing in the s and s, while undulate rays seem to be thriving along the south coast, though they are still considered endangered following over-exploitation.And the little tern, one of the UK’s rarest breeding seabirds, has scored some successes with the help of conservation work.The bird successfully bred at Cumbria Wildle Trust’s South Walney nature reserve for the first time in  years, while targeted management of habitat by Essex Wildle Trust saw them nest on Tollesbury Wick nature reserve for the first time in  years.And despite concerns in the spring that late snowfall in the Arctic would hit the breeding success of sanderlings which migrate through the UK, the autumn migration saw record numbers at Gibraltar Point,Lincolnshire.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850066.1546196471!/image/image.jpg","title":"survey finds st kilda sea caves in good condition","story":"Researchers have captured #stunning# images of marine le in the waters around St Kilda as a survey revealed its reefs and sea caves are in good condition.Scottish Natural Heritagehas just published the findings of the wide-reaching survey which was carried out in  by a team of ers.Home to nearly one million seabirds, the St Kilda archipelago is the UK’s only dual Unesco World Heritage Site for both its natural and cultural signicance.It was evacuated on August ,  after the remaining  islanders voted to leave as their way of le was no longer sustainable.The survey aimed to judge the current condition of the sea caves in the archipelago, which is situated around  miles west of the outer Hebrides and, in North Rona, north-west of Cape Wrath.The team of researchers concluded that the site was in “good condition”.The researchers also discovered a new species of soft coralwithin one of the St Kilda caves.SNH said that St Kilda hosts huge seabird populations, including the world’s second largest colony of North Atlantic gannets.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849877.1546104378!/image/image.jpg","title":"catherine stihler sad withdrawal from eu peace process","story":"It#s easy to be angry. As we enter  and the final countdown to Brexit, I share the sense of deep frustration felt by many.Anger with a Tory Prime Minister who is dragging the UK towards a clf edge with the hardline Brexiteers who don’t care about the impact on workers and with the leader of my own party who is prepared to facilitate a reckless withdrawal from the EU.That Brexit will deliver economic hardship for our country is beyond doubt. It is constitutional vandalism of the very worst kind, which will hit the poorest the hardest.Shame on those who are unwilling to stand up for the communities in the firing line. Your actions will not be forgotten.But there is another emotion as well: sadness.By the end of March, we are destined to walk away from the most important peace process the modern world has ever seen.It will decimate opportunity for the next generation, and send a signal to the world that we no longer believe in cooperation and togetherness, and instead we stand for isolationism and nationalism.I believe in solidarity and the breaking down of borders. That’s why I oppose both Scottish independence and Brexit. As the words on the back of my Labour membership card state – “by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone” – words that Jeremy Corbyn should reflect upon.I am Scottish, British and European, and Brexit is not going to take that away from me.But it is going to take away the opportunities that come with being part of the European Union.Over  years as an MEP, I have witnessed the EU expand and reform to bring nations closer together in the interests of co-operation and peace.The expansion that delivered membership to countries like Poland and Romania was a success that brought huge idends for those nations as well as our own.The economic contribution of EU migrants to Britain is beyond question. That so many workers, who pay their taxes and help run our vital services, such as the NHS, are already leaving our shores is a tragedy.They have not only contributed to our economy, but also to our society. They are our neighbours, our work colleagues and our friends. If you are having trouble finding a job, getting a house, or seeing your doctor, it’s not caused by your Polish next door neighbours, it’s caused by the Tories’ austerity ideology.That my own party also wants to end freedom of movement is deeply distressing for me.We should be shouting from the rooftops about the unions of people and nations, and how we can use their collective power for the common good. That’s at the very heart of what it means – or what it should mean – to be Labour.But I worry too about the impact of Brexit on British citizens who have enjoyed the freedom to travel across the EU unhindered.

And early, please. The trade secret is what is known in politics as the Christmas Box a folio of previously prepared stories from press teams under day-by-day embargo drip-fed to tide the papers over until proper news starts happening again.Without Christmas Boxes, the news agenda would just be a diet of the day’s emergencies, the aftermath of drunken violence and the Old Firm. A bit like BBC Scotland every weekend.This year it’s much, much easier. No-one, not the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the First Minister, the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Patriarch of Constantinople or Richard Dawkins has any idea what’s going to happen in British or European politics next week, never mind next year, so commentators can speculate away in the knowledge that reality will be crazier than any guess.My punt is the Prime Minister’s Draft Withdrawal Agreement for leaving the EU will win the day but onlyshe follows the advice to narrow down the options. There is no parliamentary majority for any of the possible pathways and despite talk of Norway or Canada Plus, it might as well be Norwegian Wood or Canada Dry for all the attention the EU is paying. The options come down to a second in-or-out referendum, the draft deal or a no-deal departure.As the government is committed to the meaningful vote by  January, the first move onfrom recess a week on Monday should be to force a vote over a second referendum. With Jeremy Corbyn committed to Brexit it’s a vote the government should win, which would leave the draft withdrawal and a no deal departure which the majority also oppose. Game, set and match, Mrs May.But having gambled with General Election odds in her favour and lost heavily, will Mrs May gamble again  With advice from the level-headed David Liddington, I’m not betting against it. VA envyEnterprising iniduals can make their own headlines, as Edinburgh Labour leader Cammy Day has done with his views on the Dundee VA and how Edinburgh should be following suit. What caught the eye, on Tayside certainly, was Cllr Day’s rejoinder that “ bloody Dundee can get a VA, then the capital city wants something even better”. Somewhat more diplomatically, bloody Dundee councillor Lynne Short responded calmly: “It is goodwe are inspiring other towns and cities.”Happily, now working on what could be Edinburgh’s answer to the VA is award-winning Scottish architect John McAslan whose catalogue of major international works includes London King’s Cross Station. Typically in his game there has been the odd political scuffle, most notably his shelved plans for Glasgow’s George Square.His practice has been working on the £m Granton collections centre for the National Galleries of Scotland and ever-helpful Cllr Day chipped in: “What we don’t want is a big storage container. We want a VA, we want something that’s quite iconic. If that’s not what’s coming forward then we are not interested.” “Quite iconic  How quite iconic would you like it, sir,” might not be Mr McAslan’s immediate reaction, but the point about a focal point for the new district is reasonable. I could hardly argue, given I made the same point in June after a sneak preview of the VA. “Siting anything like the VA in or around Edinburgh city centre would cause uproar, but put it on the seafront in Granton and it might have a similar effect as it’s having in Dundee,” I wrote. The problem with iconic, as the saga of the ten-times-over-budget £m Scottish Parliament building demonstrated, is cost. The Dundee VA is only about the same size as the Holyrood debating chamber alone and from £m ended up costing just over £m. Not quite iconicIconic is not a word often used to describe Meadowbank Stadium. Controversial or crumbling certainly, historic to an extent but symbolic not so much, not in architectural terms anyway.But the ious schemes to replace the Commonwealth Games complex have come to symbolise bitter cynicism about local decision-makingand a deep disenchantment with Edinburgh Council.For all its shortcomings, the stadium gave the district a sense of identity which the new sports centre will struggle to match.A new animated ‘fly-through’ of the replacement centre has just been released by the council, revealing a perfectly al regional sports centre, but to borrow from Cllr Day, it’s not quite iconic. Maybe the reality will be more impressive, but it doesn’t look like much for £m, certainly not the underwhelming -seat spectator area which is supposed to be a new home for Third Division high-flyers Edinburgh City.There is no sound business case for the council to build and maintain an international athletics stadium which would be needed about once every two years. If a millionaire track and field fan came forward then maybe it could be dferent, but the last time a supposed tycoon flashed his wallet around Meadowbank it didn’t end well. But the new images will do little to quell the feeling the area has been short-changed.Progress prediction nilNew Meadowbank is due to open in  and approximately  months later voters get a chance to pass judgment on their councillors at the  local elections. So in the spirit of all those Twixtmas space-fillers, here are a few predictions for Scotland’s capital in  after ten years of SNP-Labour coalitions: the Newhaven tram completion will not have taken its first fare-paying customer, the huge new Granton estate will not have risen from the old gasworks site, the South Suburban rail line’s only service will still be freight and the airport International Business Gateway will still be a field. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849875.1546106838!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm no time like the present to turn over a new leaf","story":"Looking back at the series of bloody car crashes that have constituted the last year in politics, the only positive I can come up with is that  is very nearly over.Whether it was the cruel dishonesty of US President Donald Trump, the ineffectual floundering of Prime Minister Theresa May, or the appalling rise of anti-Semitism in Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party, the past  months had something for every kind of masochist.And there’s little to suggest that  is going to be much better. Trump knows now that his war on immigrants and a free press plays wonderfully well with his base, May retains her position as the midwe of a Brexit she believes will damage the UK, and Corbyn – who deplores all kind of racism, apparently – shows no compulsion to properly challenge the wing-nuts and conspiracy theorists who’ve polluted Labour since he succeeded Ed Miliband as leader.If only those who govern – and those who aspire to – would resolve to do better next year.Trump  Well, he’s a write-off, surely  A compulsive liar and enthusiastic bully, the American president is a lost cause and we can only hope he manages to get through the coming year without beginning a war.But to our own political leaders, I offer some words of advice, some resolutions that they might consider.When right-wing Tory rebels tried and failed to topple the Prime Minister in the second week of December, they gave her some breathing space. Under Conservative Party rules, Theresa May cannot be challenged for another year.How marvellous it would bethe PM fully indulged this period of political freedom.

And wouldn’t it be rather fun, too I have suggestions for opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, too.As  looms, Jeremy, why don’t you resolve to check who it is you’re associating with and supporting  Of course, you’ve been really unlucky over the past few decades, often appearing in public with racists and anti-Semites, but next year you can be the change your party needs.When you’re asked to endorse a candidate or appear on a  with an activist, ask yourself whether your endorsement is appropriate.If you cannot tell simply by looking whether you are about to offer your support to someone who believes Jews control the world through sinister networks, there’s a thing called Google you can use to find out more.

I say  should be the year that you stop opposing internet search engines in all their forms and find out a little about the people you consider fellow travellers.But it is not just leaders at Westminster who should resolve to do things dferently in the year ahead. I have some advice for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon too.Back in , you told us that the independence referendum was a once in a letime event. You resolved, after defeat in that vote, to bring the country back together. You’ve not really done that, have you, First Minister Instead, you’ve sought to turn every political twist and turn into an argument in favour of a second referendum.

There have been a few occasions of late where I have watched debates and seen MPsusing language that could easily be construed as racist towards the people of Scotland.”But the petition was rejected on the grounds it was “about something that the UK Government or Parliament is not responsible for”. The rejection statement added: “We can’t accept your petition because this would be the responsibility of inidual MPs and not the UK Government or House of Commons as a whole.”: SNP renew calls to scrap House of LordsOther Scottish matters raised in rejected petitions included a call for MEP David Coburn to resign from the European Parliament after he quit UKIP earlier this month.A newspaper story that the Scottish Parliament had allegedly banned gingerbread men from the Holyrood canteen on the grounds of sexism prompted one petitioner to claim that “political correctness has gone too far”. The parliamentary authorities responded that it was “not clear what the petition is asking the UK Government or Parliament to do.”Several other rejected petitions demanded a second referendum on Scottish independence, while another called for Paul Gascoigne to be inducted into the SFA Hall of Fame.Of the more bizarre requests, one petitioner called in June this year for Scottish footballer Alan Hutton to be offered a new contract by his club Aston Villa.While the petition was rejected, Hutton is still on the books at Villa Park and recently scored a memorable goal in the Birmingham derby.Perhaps the most ambitious of the rejected petitions, certainly in terms of sheer scale, was a call for the Scottish border to be extended to “include the entire UK except London”. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850133.1546244151!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland s first low emission zone introduced","story":"Scotland#s first low-emission zonewill be introduced in Glasgow on Monday, but campaigners have already said it will not achieve signicant change.The first phase of the LEZ will set emission standards which must be met by  per cent of buses which pass through the city centre.It means local bus services must comply with European emissions standards.Phase two, applying to all vehicles entering the zone, is to be implemented in December .The scheme will be enforced through the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognitioncameras.But campaigners say the plan to phase out the dirtiest buses in the city centre over a five-year period will bring almost no change in the first year, and they have criticised the decision not to impose restrictions on all other vehicles until .: Nicola Sturgeon: I’ll protect Scotland’s place in Europe Air pollution campaigner Gavin Thomson said: “The toxic, illegal levels of air pollution in Glasgow causes hundreds of premature deaths and le-limiting conditions.“Unfortunately, the weak terms of this low-emission zone - only applying to one in five buses - won’t achieve any signicant change for air quality.“This ‘no ambition zone’ means fumes from transport in the centre of Glasgow will carry on poisoning people’s lungs for many more years.“Around  per cent of buses in Glasgow already met the emission standards before the zone was decided, so there will be very little change in the fleet.”Councils in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen have discussed following Glasgow in bringing in LEZs.: Fears raised that Scotland’s first low emission zone will have little impactMr Thomson said councils must be bold in their approach to tackling pollution.“Private bus operators in Glasgow are getting a free ride while everyone  is suffering the effects of illegal levels of air pollution,” he said.“Three hundred premature deaths are caused by air pollution in Glasgow every year.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union.

What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Niahm-Morrison-10-Loch-Duich-primary-winner.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated. The work includes a new social area and ICT room, plus innovative youth mental health rooms for the Flare Project.Work began to transform the centre in March, with some staff working out of the Waveney Youth Centre, and young people only being able to use a small section of the building.From June of this year the centre has been closed to facilitate the refurbishment, therefore young people and staff were really looking forward to getting back to the building.Many young people rely on the youth centre on a daily basis.Running clubs and activities five nights of the week, around  youths use the facilities. Monday and Friday nights are for nine to twelve year olds, while Tuesday and Thursdays are the senior nights for teenagers.On Wednesday the centre is available for all on their split night.Run by the Education Authority Youth Service, the centre is a valued part of the community and provides important le skill training for young people, as well as providing them with activities.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christmas in comfort at clonard","story":"CLONARD parishioners will be able to enjoy their Christmas Mass even more this year as the traditional hard wooden pews have been consigned to the past. In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37668087.ece/650ce/AUTOCROP/w620h342/policeback.jpg","title":"editors viewpoint trust in psni in west of city must be rebuilt","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For their part, senior officers have also taken steps to establish and foster better working relationships with people in the area.While there is no doubt about the magnitude of the decision by Sinn Fein, there has been a clear sense that the partys support for policing has at times seemed half-hearted.Recent criticism voiced by its representatives of a PSNI operation launched to search for a dissident weapon in Dunmurry did nothing to dispel those concerns.Equally, some people would claim that Sinn Fein has failed to do enough to encourage young nationalists to join the force, with some Catholic PSNI recruits speaking about the ongoing opposition they have faced from within their own communities.This was borne out by the Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin, who recently said the number of Catholics applying to join up seems to have stalled.At the same time, the work of the PSNI in west Belfast and other nationalist areas is being hampered by the continued threat of dissident attack, which means that officers have to respond carefully to callouts in case they are being lured into an ambush by terrorists.It must also be said that some of the concerns about policing as expressed by the people of west Belfast are shared across the province, including the frustration with the slowness of the criminal justice system and outcomes which too often do not appear to fit the crimes.These are issues to be addressed across the board, involving the input of politicians - unfortunately still not sitting at Stormont - as well as prosecutors and the judiciary.It is clear that relationships between the police and the people of west Belfast and other areas need to be improved. This will require a great deal of work, but the effort is needed on both sides."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660616.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/cattle_prod_seized.jpg","title":"cow prod used on pedestrians in northern ireland town from passing vehicle","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Using Homers Iliad as a template, Country is set in  post-ceasefire south Armagh. The shadow of the Troubles still looms large when, after a woman turns informer, an IRA gang storms the local Army base.It is Hughes ear for the local idioms that has really captured readers, with reviews declaring it \"enthralling, rigorous\", and with an execution faithful to its classical Greek counterpart.Clare Bailey CLARE BAILEYKeen to shake up local politics is self-described activist, feminist and environmentalist Clare Bailey, who took over as leader of the Green Party in Northern Ireland in .Succeeding Steven Agnew, who stepped down after seven years, the MLA for South Belfast has set her sights on raising the partys profile over the next  months.

Earlier this month Ms McDonald said that Prime Minister Theresa Mays decision to delay the so-called \"meaningful vote\" in the House of Commons had caused \"signicant concern\" across Ireland.The Sinn Fein leader added that she had made Mrs May aware that \"in a crash scenario\" a referendum on Irish unity would \"advance very quickly\".Under the terms of the  Good Friday Agreement the Secretary of State can call a referendumthey believe the majority of people in Northern Ireland no longer want to remain part of the UK.

He said: \"It creates more tension on top of what is already a very tense and isive debate in the North and Westminster. That issue is dealt with comprehensively under the Good Friday Agreement and the principle of consent, which we absolutely support.\"Mr Coveney continued: \"I have made it very clear to themthat calls for border polls, in the midst of all the other things that we are trying to find a way through on, are really unhelpful.\"He added that such a move would create more tension at a time when the focus should be on Brexit and restoring devolved government at Stormont. \"Its polarising, andyou are trying to find a way forward that both sides can live with and accept as a compromise for the greater good, well then, polarising people into hardline positions, forcing them to take positions on awkward issues in the middle of very dficult Brexit negotiations is not helpful. And unfortunately Sinn Fein has chosen to do that for its own party political reasons.\" Mr Coveney said the Irish Government and nationalists need to \"reach out to unionism in a more effective way than perhaps has been possible in recent years\".\"We are all neighbours on this island and we have to learn to live together. Unfortunately the threats of Brexit have caused a lot of tensions that we wish werent happening,\" he said.\"Unionists feel threatened by Brexit, nationalists feel threatened by Brexit, and others who are neither in Northern Ireland feel hugely frustrated by Brexit because of the paralysis that has come with it in the context of politics in Northern Ireland and the ability to get a devolved government back up and running.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"european union not trying to keep britain in says juncker","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”Mr Juncker said it was up to the British to decidethe final decision is put back to the people in a second referendum or so-called People’s Vote.However he said he was “working on the assumption thatwill leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided”.“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May,” Mr Juncker added.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Government cannot renege on Brexit Dr Fox told the Sunday Times that Brexit will only be “% certain”the House of Commons backs the Prime Minister’s deal in a crunch vote next month.The International Trade Secretary warned fellow MPs that failure to pass Mrs May’s deal would be “incendiary” and said it was “a matter of honour” for them to support the PM.Having given the public the right to decide on EU membership in a referendum, “Parliament cannot now, with any honour, renege on that result”, said Dr Fox.“Were they to do so, I think you would shatter the bond of trust between the electorate and Parliament. And I think that would put us into unprecedented territory with unknowable consequences.”Campaigners for a second EU referendum seized on the International Trade Secretary’s comments, saying that polls suggested that fewer than % of Britons now want to leave the EU.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a referendum, said: “Brexit not happening isn’t - as Liam Fox says. It’s actually -.”The Government is obviously trying to shake us up so we think we have got no choiceDavid DavisFacebookTwitterFormer Brexit Secretary David Davis said he expected defeat for Mrs May’s plan in the Commons to force the UK and EU back to the negotiating table to strike a new deal before March .Mr Davis told LBC radio: “They will have to come back and deal again. The deal she’s got is no good.“It will be very, very nerve-wracking for some people and some companies, but at the end of the day we will get a deal and it will be a better one than she has got. That’s where I think it will go and that’s what I think she should do.”Mr Davis dismissed ministers’ warnings of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit as “scare stories”.“The Government is obviously trying to shake us up so we think we have got no choice,” he said.“They are saying to the ones who want Brexit ‘If you don’t vote for this you won’t get Brexit’ and to those who don’t want Brexit ‘If you don’t vote for this you will have the worst sort of Brexit, you will have a hard crash-out’. Both these stories can’t be right.“They are trying to run the clock down. I don’t think it’s a wise strategy.”Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the Government had put Britain into a “ridiculous” position.He tweeted: “Combination of  Brexit promises and useless Government. No deal has never been viable and, as every day passes, it becomes less so.”But the Scottish National Party’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, retorted: “The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green Party are all working together to try and get a People’s Vote. Why don’t Labour work with us and others on the Government benches to stop this madness “Labour will not be forgiven for standing aside. You can call me anytime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"record demand from uk for irish passports","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"derry couple give christmas gift nurses helped save twin babies lives","story":"Two little Derry twins have delivered an early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“As my we says, when the parents go home at night we are leaving our babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin"},{"url":null,"title":"nwrc offers january short courses early years","story":"CAPTION:Ann McDuffand Sean Mc Cormickpictured with NWRC staff Karen Moore,

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

It has also a topic of considerable concern and a high profile environmental issue.Members of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee were told on Monday night that flytipping places a ldquosignicant demand on the organisationrsquos budget with staff also erted away from other duties to deal with the problem.Council officials are currently working alongside Environment Agency staff and neighbouring local authorities in what is being described as an attempt to ldquoadopt compatible practices and approaches to highlight the issue and reduce the scale of the problem.If the amount of the waste dumped mdash mostly in secluded areas mdash is greater than two cubic metres, or is hazardous, the incident is reported to the government agency. Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat. They have been operating here since , butany change in the situation was introduced I think they would accept it.DRUMANESS mdash Teddy, the big-hearted golden labrador from Drumaness, who made a habit of carrying his masterrsquos schoolbag home from school each day, is missing. Owner, Patsy Tweedie, of Mullamore Drive, thinks he is dead.Teddy, who featured on the Recorderrsquos front page in February, hasnrsquot been around his home for over two weeks and this makes Mr Tweedie almost certain he is dead.ldquoTeddy had been running around with a bitch recently and came him peppered with pellets just before he disappeared, Mr Tweedie said. ldquoThat makes me believe he has been shot by some farmer who thought he was worrying sheep.ldquoIf that is the case I feel the farmer has made a mistake. Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that. He was well known in the village and senior citizens were often thankful to have him around as a sort of watch dog.Mr Tweedie said there had been several cases of sheep worrying in the district recently and thatrsquos what led him to believe that a farmer may have shot him.He added: ldquoWe certainly miss him. One way or another, I would be interested to hear from anyone who saw him recently.KILLYLEAGH mdash Mr David Watson thought he had fought his last battle with the end of World War  mdash but he was wrong. Mr Watson, who is  and probably one of Killyleaghrsquos oldest residents, has been fighting a gruelling battle with the Housing Executive to obtain a house without stairs.At his Comber Road home Mr Watson and his  year-old we, Liza-Jane, have been tormented for a long time by problems which are easily overcome by the young, but cause massive complications for older citizens.The normally simple operation of climbing stairs is is a great task for Mrs Watson. Because of ill health, she has to crawl up to her bedroom on hands and knees and get back down on hands and knees.Spearheading the Watsonsrsquo case has been their daughter, Mrs Jean Cheevers, and after a long struggle she has finally managed to get good news for her parents.After bringing her case to the attention of the local MP, Mr Enoch Powell, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Cllr Rowan-Hamilton, the Sunday News and the Down Recorder, she has at last evoked a reaction from the Housing Executive.The Executive has now decided to take a ldquohumanitarian attitude to the couplersquos case, therefore increasing their chances of getting a stair-free home.In a sympathetic letter to Mrs Cheevers, an Executive spokesman explained that full consideration had been given to the age and state of health of Mr and Mrs Watson.ldquoI should add that our ability to rehouse your parents in accommodation suitable to their needs will be dependent on such accommodation becoming available in the area, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK mdash A bumper medieval pageant proposed for Downpatrick in May to celebrate St Patrick is hanging in the balance mdash and only a large turnout at a public meeting early in the New Year can save it from the chop.The pageant, the brainchild of Down Councilrsquos arts committee, is seen to be one of the best ideas to come out of the district for some time mdash but unless sufficient backing is forthcoming, then the community festival will have to be scrubbed.Organisers have been guaranteed funds from Down Council, but in order to quality for a big payout by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have to have the potential to be a major tourist attraction and to be continued each year.Mr Frank Connolly, a spokesman for the arts committee told the Recorder: ldquoIf there is no support, there will be no festival, itrsquos as simple as that. Wersquore calling a public meeting for January  in the new library in Downpatrick and itrsquos essential that there is a massive turnout of interested people and of organisations who are willing to play a part.ldquoA successful event would no doubt help tourism and itrsquos in the interest of the district to give it their full support.BALLYGOWAN mdash A young handicapped Ballygowan boy received an extra Christmas surprise recently when his pet donkey gave birth to a baby foal.Seven year-old Gregory Townley suffers from spina bida but the new addition to the family is certain to add an extra sparkle to Christmas for him.His mother, Mrs Myrtle Townley, said: ldquoMy husband got a donkey for Gregory two years ago after he bought a motorbike for my nine year-old son Roy. The little foal was born two weeks ago and Gregory will now have twice as much to handle.ldquoHe has still not picked a proper name for the new addition.

Behind-the-scenes discussions are tang place in an attempt to end the monopoly of harbour facilities by the Strangford ferry and open up berths for smaller craft.Strangford, as a port of call for small boats, was virtually closed off several years ago with the expansion of the ferry service and ancillary facilities.The villagersquos past has always been linked with the harbour when an armada of small boats tied up at the harbour wall, particularly during the successful carnival days.DRUMNAQUOILE mdash Police are investigating the slaughter of three sheep and the injuring of ten others in the Drumnaquoile area.

Mr Lamport said that a slot had been set aside in Prince Charles’ diary to visit Northern Ireland in July. “He [the Prince] wouldpossible like the visit to cover the same areas of interest that would be included in a visit to a provincial city in Great Britain, such as young people, the unemployed, inner city issues and industry.“He would like to feel that he was doing something useful for the people, not things that were entirely symbolic and lacking in substance.”The NIOpermanent secretary said it was “enormously important that the Prince should visit Northern Ireland” but that “a visit of no more than a day and a half would be best for security reasons, arriving in the afternoon, and with no publicity until the second morning”.The note also recorded: “Mr Lamport said that the Prince hoped to visit the Republic of Ireland in the autumn, after [underlined] a visit to Northern Ireland.“It was agreed that it was important that the visits should be in this order ... HM Ambassador in Dublin was enthusiastic about the possibility of a visit.” The prince did visit the Republic in .In discussion about the upcoming briefing on Northern Ireland, there was a note to say that security policy should be included but it should be “not too heavy” and there was also a request that “demographic trends should be covered”.Almost , from UK applied for Irish passport in New Year’s Honours: Somebody was thinking about me, says Finlay Spratt MBE Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingDeclassied Files: Downing Street was prepared to give IRA a weapons amnesty in Teenager dies after motorway bridge fallNew Yearrsquos Honours: Devoted and long-serving NI pair recognisedNew Year Honours: Northern Irelandrsquos full list revealedSafety concerns after rocks fall onto road          ..

briefing on the emerging Northern Ireland peace process in which there were plans to tell him that the IRA was showing signs of #war-weariness#, a declassied file has revealed.The June   event was planned for over several months and involved both the then secretary of state, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and many of the most senior officials in the Northern Ireland Office and the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, David Fell.The briefing – which is the subject of its own substantial file – was to be held in the Old Admiralty Building in Whitehall and was scheduled to last for about an hour and a quarter.The file, which is among those declassied at the Public Record Office in Belfast under the -Year Rule, only records preparations for the event and does not contain any material which claries what happened on the day.The heir to the throne was to be given a slide presentation which would be introduced by Sir Patrick before a series of senior NIO officials each dealt with their area of expertise.Communications with St James’ Palace about the event were classied as ‘secret and personal’, an unusually high classication.The briefing was to have initially taken place in March  but was postponed until June of that year.The material to be explained to Prince Charles stated that “PIRA’s capabilities have been eroded somewhat in recent years and there are some signs of war-weariness and declining support”.However, he was also to be told that despite that the IRA “remains dangerous, well-equipped and capable of striking at a wide range of targets”.The main threats from the IRA were described as snipers, car bombs, Mark  horizontal mortars and Mark  ‘barrack buster’ mortars.The prince was to be told that loyalist paramilitaries had been “very active in the s” but that “during much of the s they were more or less moribund”.The briefing went on: “The last - years, however, has seen a sharp resurgence in loyalist violence, reflecting in part growing anxiety in loyalist working-class areas over perceived political gain by the nationalists.“In  they were responsible for only % of terrorist murders in the past two years they have killed more people than republicans.Almost , from UK applied for Irish passport in  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article

shootings.”The prince was also to be told: “It is regularly claimed that the security forces are in collusion with loyalist terrorists. In fact, the numbers of persons charged with terrorist offences demonstrates this is not the case. In the last two years, more loyalists have been charged than republicans.”The briefing contained reference to the security services’ clandestine contacts with the IRA: “On the peace side, as is now well known there has for many years been a secret means of communication with the Provisional movement.” A note in the margin described these as “longstanding but unavowed contacts whose utility required secrecy” and that as part of that communications channel an “exchange of messages followed communication from Sinn Fein in February  that ‘the conflict is over’.”A note, perhaps in anticipation of a question from the prince, said that the “messages sent were consistent with HMG’s public positions”.try catch  TrendingDeclassied Files: Downing Street was prepared to give IRA a weapons amnesty in Teenager dies after motorway bridge fallNew Yearrsquos Honours: Devoted and long-serving NI pair recognisedNew Year Honours: Northern Irelandrsquos full list revealedSafety concerns after rocks fall onto road          ..

coastlines are dotted with swimmers who go out no matter what the weather or temperature.Team Dash and Splash swimmers, some in fancy dress, after a swim in the Irish Sea at Bangor beach.

It includes younger and older swimmers, male and female, with a range of abilities who swim every day come rain, hail or snow.Martin Strain said the group has been going informally for eight years but has grown notably in the last three. He said cold water plungeshelp members who have mental health issues.In Bangor, the Brompton Belles and Beaux have a core who swim every day at am. Marie-Therese Davis-Hanson started the group in  and said numbers have rocketed.One of the newest groups is Team Dash and Splash, whose members run along the coast before a plunge at Pickie Beach, Bangor on Sunday morning. Member and former Olympic swimmer Andrew Bree said it has been a big change from the warm indoor pools of his competitive career.“The water temperature gets down to around four five degrees in February and March here,” he said.“I got injured in  and left the sport not the way I wanted to and I think that affected me, but now I have found that love for the water again.“It strips the ego, when you get into the cold, there is no room for the past, there is no room for thoughts, you are focused on the present moment.Family’s thanks for Parker’s gt of le Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“My benefit was definitely mental, but there has also been a cardiovascular benefit, I have taken up more running and things I didn’t use to do. I come from a swimming background but I never liked running.“I think it’s from the cold, you are pumping that blood through the body, I just feel overall really good from it.”Dash and Splash founder Scott Riley said it started with a Facebook post in October .“I was going for a run and sea swim anyway, I got really interested in the health benefits of cold water and I was training to become a Wim Hof method instructor at that time which is a breathing and cold training technique for strengthening the nervous system,” he said.“The first week,  people turned up.

I wish you every success with you future campaigning.”Mr Rees-Mogg is the latest in a long line of senior Tories to have come to Northern Ireland for fundraising or other events organised by the DUP, including Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, who attended a dinner hosted by Arlene Foster, and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who spoke at a fundraiser for Ian Paisley in north Antrim.However, Mr Gove denied that he was aware that it was a DUP fundraiser, unlike Mr Rees-Mogg who has been open about the purpose of the event.Mr Shivers said that he had approached Mr Rees-Mogg at the Conservative conference in Birmingham in the autumn and it was there that the MP told him that he was coming to raise money for the DUP in January.Mr Shivers said that during a robust conversation he had pressed Mr Rees-Mogg to do the same for the NI Conservatives and then had followed that up by writing to the MP.He said that in conversation Mr Rees-Mogg had described the Tories’ arrangement with the DUP as a “coalition”, something which is not the case because the parties have a confidence and supply deal, a looser agreement.However, Mr Shivers said he had pointed out that even when the Tories were in coalition with the Liberal Democrats it would have been unthinkable for a senior Tory to raise funds for what was a rival party.Declassied files: Top officials prepared detailed private briefing on Northern Ireland for Prince Charles Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Shivers said it was “disrespectful” for senior party colleagues to come to be fundraising for the DUP.He claimed that the DUP fundraising events were in some cases raising “in excess of £,” – a huge sum in Northern Ireland politics – while “we’re relying on our members giving contributions”.However, DUP MP Jim Shannon, who has been instrumental in bringing many senior Tories – including Andrea Leadsom and Julian Lewis – to DUP events, said he “would be amazedthat was the case”.Mr Shannon, who will have another senior Brexiteer backbencher, Peter Bone, at a DUP event in his Strangford constituency in February, said that in his case he splits the money raised at the event evenly between the DUP and Elim Missions.He highlighted that the party had also brought over Labour MPs such as Kate Hoey and Stephen Pound, something he said was part of “building relationships” at Westminster and which had been going on for years.Mr Shivers said he was“extremely disappointed by fellow Conservatives” coming and “raising funds for our electoral competitors”. He said: “We certainly seem to be the poor cousins.”The event is also further evidence of the growing links between the DUP and leading Tory Eurosceptics. The party has been working increasingly closely with the anti-EU European Research Group of which Mr Rees-Mogg is a leading member, and last month gave a rapturous welcome to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson when he addressed the DUP conference.Many DUP members also share important ground with the devoutly Catholic Mr Rees-Mogg on social issues such as abortion.try catch  TrendingDeclassied Files: Downing Street was prepared to give IRA a weapons amnesty in Teenager dies after motorway bridge fallNew Yearrsquos Honours: Devoted and long-serving NI pair recognisedNew Year Honours: Northern Irelandrsquos full list revealedSafety concerns after rocks fall onto road          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
